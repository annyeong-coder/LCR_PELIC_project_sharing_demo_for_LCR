# LCR_PELIC_future_v01
v01 My first attempt at an official Git repository for my LCR final project about L2 development and will/going to.

THIS IS NO LONGER AN ACTIVE PROJECT - I'm temporarily keeping this repository as a sample for a presentation on sharing data more openly in SLA research.  

NOTE - This repository is only for demonstrating sharing data and code, not for demonstrating appropriate practices for open research... in other words - it is DEFINITELY NOT A MODEL!  The 'work' here is incomplete and (mostly) incoherent.  It is a branch from an incomplete project.  

##
This one is "v01", which I created first at Github using my browswer, then went and created a new R project in Rstudio.
