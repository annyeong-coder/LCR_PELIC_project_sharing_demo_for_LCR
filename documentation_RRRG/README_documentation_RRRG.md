# What is RRR?

RRR stands for
  - Reproducibility
  - Replicability
  - Robustness 
  - Generalizability

# What is the purpose of the Documentation RRRG directory?

As implied above, these will be the files used to document the exact procedures for the current study. This is the first project where I am trying this. 

If it works well enough, I'll standardize this in a way that works for all future projects.

If it doesn't work well, or seems to not provide any additional benefit, then I'll just migrate all of this information to the README file in the root folder of each project.
