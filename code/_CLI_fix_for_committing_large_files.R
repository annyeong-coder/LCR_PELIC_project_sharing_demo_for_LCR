# Of course you can ignore the GUI and stick to the command-line Git forever, but if you don't want, a quick jump to the command-line git would solve this problem for now.

# The temporary solution that I found is as follows:

#    Click on the blue-gear icon on the GIT panel, inside RStudio.
#    Select Shell (a terminal window will pup up!)
#    Write the add and commit command in the terminal:

# {ATTENTION: The following command will commit changes on ALL files! You may want to use what is appropriate for your situation!}

#    git add -A && git commit -m 'staging all files'

# Now you can go back to the GUI Git, and click on push button. All files that you staged in the terminal window, will be pushed up to your repository.
