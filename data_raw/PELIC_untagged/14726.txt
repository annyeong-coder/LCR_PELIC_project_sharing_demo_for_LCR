When I had come the U. S my cousin's husband helped me a lot. First he helped me how to pronounce and speak English better. Then he let me learn everyday because I was spending lots of money for each semester. In fact nobody is perfect he sometimes makes some mistakes that's why we had some arguments and he made me feel upset because he always thought he's right. For example when I wrote a sentence he said that is wrong but I didn't agree. After that I brought it to my English teacher and she said that I was right. I think the best way to learn a language that is I have to talk with whom speak their own language who is local people. So I made friend with someone then they help me a lot of. They give their suggests to me although that isn't frequently. Anyways I want to say thanks with anyone who helped me about English because I know that I have to spend a lot of things for studying English.
