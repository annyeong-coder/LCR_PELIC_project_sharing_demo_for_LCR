Clarify That was today's reading class. We went to the G 17 at that time I did not know what should I do. There were two men who clarified what was going on. They explaind how I could my user name and pass word when I entered 'REAP' project but I did not understand it exactly. I needed clarification of the problem. Peter my reading teacher helped me clarify it. After that I could enter this project. Thank you Peter. One of the men said this project helped me improve my English. I wish it would be true.
