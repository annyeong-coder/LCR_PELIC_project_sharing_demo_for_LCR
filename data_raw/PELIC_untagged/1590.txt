My successful thing One of my successful things was playing the harp called Indian harp or Arpa. Arpa is the most famous instrument in Paraguay that is one of the countries in South America. Now I can play it well but there were some problems until I can do it well. First in 1995 I started to play the Arpa in Paraguay but I didn't like playing Arpa for Spanish. I couldn't speak Spanish and understand what teacher said but I could understand only 'Si' or 'No'. So I didn't practice well in Paraguay. In 1999 I went back to Japan and I became interested in playing the Arpa. I started to practice it hard. There was second problem. For my poor practices I couldn't remember the tunes that I learned in Paraguay. I wanted to learn from teachers who taught Arpa but there weren't any teacher around my house. In fact there were few people that teach or even know the Arpa in Japan. So I had to learn tunes from my mother or learn by hearing CDs of Arpa in myself. It was really hard for me to learn from CDs because I didn't have perfect pitch. Third there were no scores for Arpa. So I had to learn by hearing watching and playing the music and I practiced tunes many hours a day. Arpa had a cheerful and sweet sound that cheered me up and it had beautiful cheerful and sometimes sad music. Playing Arpa was difficult for me but I really loved it and I liked to practice it.
