I had never rowed a boat like the kayak before I came to the U. S. It was September 29 I had been kayaking with my classmates of ELI after we took a tour of Heinz Field. Now I have learned how to control the direction of movement of a kayak. If I have free time I would like to go again. In addition I had not yet seen a real polar bear before I went to the Pittsburgh Zoo and PPG Aquarium. This Sunday I went to the zoo with my friends. We had a lot of fun and then will share our photos on Facebook.
