When I was ten years I went to primary school. At first day I made relationship with some friends but there was a friend who looks like as same as my age. I approached to him to talk. Then we became together every day and graduated from primary school. Now he is my best friend whose name is Ahamed. In addition my best friend who lives in Riyadh city is studying in king ANON_NAME_0 University which is the biggest university in the Middle East. Ahamed has great personalities that are honest generous and respectful. Ahamed is struggling to start a businessman. ANON_NAME_1 has two cars whose cars are beautiful and nice. Last year I went to his home when he invited me. I saw his library which is fabulous and has many books. We had a good time together.
