My father taught me enjoying reading books. Reading is my hobby. I appreciate him giving this wonderful enjoyment. When I was a little child I preferred listening to my mother reading a book. I didn't read books by myself. But my father didn't make me read books myself. When I was 6 years old my father bought me a Greek myths book because he knew I liked listening it. But reading chinese character was difficult for me. My father wrote how to read chinese character in that book and help me read the book. By this way he got me to read books myself. After that my father had me read books which he choose. For example The Story of Dr. Dollitle was one of my favorite book he bought me. In addition my family often went to book store. My father allowed me choice one favorite book and he bought it for me. Now I can't imagine life without books.
