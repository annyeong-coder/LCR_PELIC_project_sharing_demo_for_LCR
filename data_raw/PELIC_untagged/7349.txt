I have already traveled to China. I went to there last year for summer vacation. I saw a lot of China people and a lof of diffrent of culture. Specially I reamberd very big temple. It was very amazing. However I have never gone to Roma but I would like to there. I've never seen Colosseum. If I see it I will be very happy.
