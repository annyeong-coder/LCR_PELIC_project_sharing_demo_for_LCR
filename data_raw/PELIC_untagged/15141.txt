Before I came here to the USA I wasn't be able to learn English language because I was very busy I have been working as a University Staff Member. Therefore my time was always busy but now all my time just for learning English language. I have studied English language for 4 years when I was in graduate school but just for academic studying not for grammar and technical writing. But to be honest I have been looking for learning English at least I was concerned to learn English by watching T. V even though I didn't understand what they said during the movie or program. I addition I have been concerning to learn English language from the origin country which is the native language for it it was like a dream for me but the dream comes true.
