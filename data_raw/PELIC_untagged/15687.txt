We usually make many judgments of each other and ourselves depended on previous knowledge but this judgments sometimes will be right and sometimes will be wrong. By this judgments we make wide idea about someone or something. For example before I came to the US I had idea about the American people are not friendly. I think this idea comes from the UK . Because the England people are not friendly. I used to make this idea about American people. But now I changed my mind one hundred percent. Other example some student in the ELI thinking all the families in Libya have a camel I think it is right idea but not now because more than ninety percent from Libyan families now do not have it. Finally I can say our judgments effect by the media.
