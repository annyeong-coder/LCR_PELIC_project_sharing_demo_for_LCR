I was absence a lot of time. So I don't know my classmate well. So I want to introduce my friend Jimi . Jimi would be a good roommate for me because we have the same hobbies interests and plans. I want to improve my English skills because I am interested in another country's culture. Also she is interested in another country's culture. So we can learn another country's culture from each other. Her hobby is watching movies and listening music. My hobby is watching movies too. So we can enjoin together. And we know each other well since we were 13 years old. I can believe my friend.
