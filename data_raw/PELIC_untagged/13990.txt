Dear Members I know that some of you are discouraged because it is taking you so long to run five miles. Don't give up yet. A runner I knew made a progress because he keeped up. In the first year he need 45 minutes to run five miles. It is so long. He continued running everyday. He ran faster in the second year and he just need 34 minutes. This is a big improvement. In the fourth year he can run five miles in 32 minutes. After several years he just need about 30 minutes. He saved 15 minutes totally. Remember to keep up and you will run faster. Best ANON_NAME_0
