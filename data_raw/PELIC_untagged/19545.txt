By chance I met my best friends ANON_NAME_0. I remember when I was walking in London three years ago I saw someone his name ANON_NAME_0 from Saudi Arabia at this minute he introduced himself and I did the same way too he was studying at the London School of Political Science when I came to London as a tourist. I invited him to have dinner together. When we ware having dinner his friend ANON_NAME_1 came and joined us. In next day ANON_NAME_0 called me when I was staying in hotel of London he wanted me to go with him to his school to see his teacher. Will we were walking to his school we saw front of his school his teacher John he greeted me and encouraged me to study in this school. After that I decided to study there with him. ANON_NAME_0 is still my best friend even we go far away from each other.
