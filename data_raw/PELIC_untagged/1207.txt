One day I had a dinner with my friends. It was very bad teast food. It called Shawerma a famus arabic sandwich but this resturant was crezy. It is a a bread with chicken pieces and salad. The problem with that resturant is the flavore. I picked a sandwich with a wierd flavor which I thought it would be good but in fact it was the worst flavor thet I have ever teast. I have not aet from that resturant again.
