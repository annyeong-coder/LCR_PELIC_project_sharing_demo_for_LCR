Some people prefer to take a position in a company and work for it but I prefer to go to business by myself. In my opinion the best way of communication is face to face. There are some mistakes that will happen through the word phone and computer. Through the face to face discussion I can realize what people want and supply my great products and service. Take myself for example I wanted to rent a new apartment and checked the information of the manager company's homepage. They described an apartment was really nice and shinny but when I made an appointment to see that room that even was located in the ground floor. I couldn't see any sunlight in that room! Even though the manager explained to me that other floor had a lot of sunlight I didn't trust this company anymore. In case of the mistake I choose to go business by myself. That really takes me more time and energy. However I can give the customers what they really want and the top service. They are worth to get that.
