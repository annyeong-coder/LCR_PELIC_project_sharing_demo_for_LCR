Learning English is one of my goals in my life. The effective way to do that is to live and study in the place where the language is spoken. For this reason I had to get into the process of studying overseas. This process contain three steps. First I applied for scholarship from my government. After I got the scholarship I decide to study in the States. The biggest reason was because my father studied there. Second I search for the best schools and contacted them. After that I got accepted to two schools. Pitt University was one of them. At this time I Googled the two cities for comparison. The activities that Pittsburgh had was the reason for chosing it. Last step I applied for a visa. Also I booked a flight. Now I'm in Pittsburgh trying to achieve my goal.
