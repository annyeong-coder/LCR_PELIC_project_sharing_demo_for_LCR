It was February 2006 I had graduated high school. I had been contacting by telephone with my friends. Since last fall I had been getting letters from friends. Originally I planned to come here with my father. So I had learned that how to make food from mother but plan was change. Our family came together here. Sometimes I had been cooking at home for 4 months. In Korea I had been exercising regularly for 1 year but now I can't exercise because I can't find fitting place for it.
