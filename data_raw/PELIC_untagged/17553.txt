What I like about the U. S. Is that the cultural composition is so diverse. What I really like about the U. S. Is how cheap the beef is. What I love about the U. S. Is how enthusiastic the ELI tutors are. What I don't like about the U. S. That it is not as convenient as Taiwan. What I don't really like about the U. S. Is how huge the gap between the rich and poor is that results in the conflict ideologies between different social groups. What I hate about the U. S. Is when stores release discounts after Christmas which means shoes I bought costs me more than people do.
