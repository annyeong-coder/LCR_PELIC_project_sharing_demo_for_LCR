Improved but not always safe scientific american World health organization celebrated in this spring because it evolved drinking water for two billion since 1990. The target of U. N general assembly is finding clean water and safety sources. By 2012 there is large percent of people who use unimproved water that comes from different sources. These sources are contaminated and probably not clean. The result of the report that published in world health organization is demonstrating that improved water sources failed in safety test in five countries. Many statistics states that around 1. 8 Billion people and 28 of the population worldwide was using unsafe water as of 2010. Unclean water includes many bacteria and viruses which cause severe health problem. Increase these diseases may be cause a high cost in cleaning and reproduction. The problem that is unnoticeable between improved and safe water is increasing. In addition to if we did not make maintenance for pipes they would affect by bacterial contamination. We should focus on establishing pipes wells and other improvements which are very effective. A lot of people still have to transport water from source to their homes. The world bank points that 40 of home water samples were clean but it is contaminated upon collection that means they need to make extensive study for water in home which is more difficult. Traditional tests were lacking modern equipment to examine type of bacteria in the water so gundry and his colleagues have evolved one feasible solution called Aqua test which contains ready tool that helps reading the presence of E coli within about 24 hours. They have 20 000 devices that used globally and gundry and his group need partner to increase production and distribution. The demand for sanitation is wanted and susceptible water sources are likely contaminated so sanitation is the big problem and we should improve all water sources to prevent risks of unclean water.
