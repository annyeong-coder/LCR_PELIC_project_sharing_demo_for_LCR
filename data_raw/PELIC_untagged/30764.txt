I am so lazy to clean my room but sometimes this messy room lets me down a little. So I decide to re decorate my room as soon as possible. Before I clean up my room I'll talk re decorating over with my roommate and pick up some well designed furniture and accessories on website of shopping mall and order them. During they are being delivered I'll take all curtain down and clean them up and touch up the wall which was scratched on a moving in day with white paint. I've never cleaned on my desk. So I'll put away trashes and papers on the desk and straighten all of books up then I'll tear down the old map and put up a new world map on the right wall of my desk. After the furniture is delivered I'll rearrange all my furniture with a new one and hang up simple designed clock on the wall. If I do that it'll makes me cheer up.
