My favorite thing is to where I've never been. I've never read the quote by Diane Arbus. But I agree her opinion because traveling the same place where I've been is really boring as if everyday eating only fried chicken. I have ever tried a skin scuba dive in Indonesia. That was very exciting and wonderful experience. However I don't want to go back to Indonesia in order to dive again. If I try to dive again I want to go to another place such as Antarctica because I have never been to Antarctica. I think diving in Antarctica will be also extremely exciting experience.
