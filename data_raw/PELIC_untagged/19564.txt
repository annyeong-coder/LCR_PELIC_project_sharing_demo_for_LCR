If I won the lottery I'll have a great deal of money. So I can buy anything I need. I'll buy a house that is the nearest one to the beach. Then I'll buy some cars for different used. I like the palm so I'll plant a plenty of palms in the front yard. Also I'll spend most of the amount in the investments. I'll establish my business. Maybe I'll buy a few buildings and make them for rent. In addition I'll open one salon for women's care. Otherwise I'll donate a little money to the charity. I hope one day I can achieve all of that.
