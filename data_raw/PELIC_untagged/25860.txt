In my opinion I think it is important for people to eat home cooked food for many reasons. First home cooked food is wholesome fresh and healthy more than other food such as home meal replacements convenience food and fast food. Second it's a good idea to gather all family member in the same table. Third home cooked food usually cost less than other food. To support this idea Lisa Young who is a nutritionist and author of The Portion Teller says Cooking is not just a quaint or old fashioned skill but an important family tradition that encourages more healthful eating. In addition she says fast food can lend to long term health problems such as obesity and heart disease. . . Etc.
