I agree that variety is the spice of life. I lived and studied in Taiwan. Most of the people who live in Taiwan will go to college when they finish high school. But I decided to learn English in America. Then I feel it is exciting for me to have a different experience. Because I never real had a conversation with native English speaker. Also this is my first time to live without family. I have to do everything by myself. So I find that I am more mature than before. Moreover my English is better than before. Variety makes my life more exciting and interesting. I would like to have a lot of variety in my life.
