I don't have a lot of friends in my life because I don't like to talk with strangers. So I don't speak too much if I meet stranger or unfamiliar people. However I usually become talkative man in front of my friends. Anyway I have a friend who lives in Seoul Korea. His name is ANON_NAME_0 Jun. When I was student in elementary school I moved to Busan in which I was born. At that time the friend whose house was near my house liked to ride a bicycle. Also I liked to ride a bicycle so we could be friend. I have another friend who is same last name as Jun. This is because they are twins. Both of them are my best friends and sometimes we talk about something by internet. A few months ago I heard something from my mother that was about their school. I didn't believe what she said. My mother told me that they decided to go another university for their dreams. They want to be an actor so they changed their school which is located in Seoul. So I worried about something that is their tuition fees. Their mother whom I know couldn't pay the tuition fees. This is because she is a mother whose husband was dead. However they clearly solved the problem. The twins whom have never worked do part time job until now so they could entered university. These days they are learning about acting and then they will appear on stage before long. I hope they will be famous actor but actually I think they won't.
