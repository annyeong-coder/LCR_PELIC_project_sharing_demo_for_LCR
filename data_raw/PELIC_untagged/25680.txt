My living room is large and bright. This cheers me up. I like bright room because dark room brings me down. I hang up a picture on the wall. I think it would be nice to hang some photographs up too. I straighten it up every weekend. I throw the trash away every day. I like to sit down on my new couch. Sometimes I turn on the TV. I try to put books back after I take them off the shelves.
