Comparing myself with my sister. In my family I would like to compare and contrast my self with my sister. However there are similarities and differences between her and I. Like physical appearance character body language. Physical similarities between my sister and I. For one thing her eyes are different color then mine. Also her skin color is darker then mine I have lighter skin color. Her hair is cut short style and mine is longer then her. Therefore her eyes look bigger then mine. My sister's character is not similar to my character as she would not show up when she get upset or angry. On the other hand I have the different character then hers. When she gets upset or angry she does not show it. But I am the opposite I usually show what I feel like. However my sister and I have different body languages. When I get upset I can not make my body stay calm and my face never changes its mimics. But my sister is always get red on her face and stay calm although frequency between her worlds increases. Finally even thought we come from the same family and despite the fact we have same mother and father we are unique. We both have different ways of understanding and responding to life.
