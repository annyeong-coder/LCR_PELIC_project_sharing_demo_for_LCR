My name is ANON_NAME_0. Some of my family calls me Tita because Colombian people call others by their diminutive form of their name. For example Claud ita ends in ita so my sisters started saying ita ita then my parents finished the name with Tita. I am studying English at ELI because I want to go back to college. At first I was planning to become a Spanish and Art teacher but now I do not know what I am going to do yet. Maybe my family is thinking that I would be a good teacher because I was a Textile Design teacher at the Autonoma University of Barranquilla Colombia. On the other hand I love animals and I have always wanted to become a Veterinarian. The problem is that to become a Veterinarian requires many more years of study than teaching. However I enjoy being a wife and a mother. Certainly it is one of the best careers God gave me the opportunity to have in my life.
