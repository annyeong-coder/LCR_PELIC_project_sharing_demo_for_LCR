Indent Once 2 years ago I had a horrendous accident when I was driving a car which a friend's had rented it in that day. I woke that morning with heart in mouth after a frightening nightmare in which I was a pilot of ship that was sinking. I dragged myself out of bed after some time and gulp up my breakfast feeling the early morning getting ready for the day. I was waiting my friend to go shopping as we planned before. When he picked me up he looked awful the early morning stupefaction he wanted me to drive the car because he felt he couldn't focus on the road. I was speeding crazily at first then I realized that and slowed down. The road is crowded and I am going 120 Km h which is the speed limit in there suddenly the hood of that car fly up into the windshield making my heart jump out of my mouth. I can't see any thing and small fragments of the windshield every where. It is like it hits my head. I magically control it. I try to pull out on the side without hitting anything. I stopped and checked the car it was damaged badly. However the weather was sweltering so I preferred to continue than waiting an hour for help. The car was like diving and I could hardly over the windshield. It was an accident that is imprinted on my memory.
