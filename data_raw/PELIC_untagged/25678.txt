I usually spend time in my bedroom. It makes me feel comfortable. When someone bring me down I go to my bedroom and do nothing. Sometimes I don't feel good I straigthen up my room. Nevertheless it doesn't look neat I do over and over. Several years ago suddenly I felt the curtain isn't go along with my mood. So I took the curtain down and hung a new curtain. Lying on my bed make me come up with creative ideas. Sleeping in my bedroom makes me cheer up. I always go to my bedroom when someone let me down. And think over how to solve the problems.
