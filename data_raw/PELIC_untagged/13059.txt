In Pittsburgh I'm living with my sister and brother in law. Everything is new experience in the U. S. At first they had me go for shopping to Waterfront. There were various things. Next they let me go the gym. I'm going there every other days now. Then she made me practice driving a car. In the U. S steering wheel and traffic lane are reverse to Japan. I was very scared. But he help me to drive a car safety. Finally they got me to go the gym by the car that I drove.
