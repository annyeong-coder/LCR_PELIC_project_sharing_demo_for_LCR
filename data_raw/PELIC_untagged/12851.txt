Dear Mr. Prsident When you receive a report which indicates clearly that an American company sells products which can cause cancer pollute the air in a room and incur the hazards of burning buildings and forests and only the company rather than its costumer can benefit from this kind of product. Are you angry at this company Will you take an action to stop the company's sale You will definitely say no to this so mean company. You may not believe the legal existence of this kind of companies in the U. S. But the sad truth is yes they do. They are tobacco companies and they sell this sort of product cigarette. For years tobacco companies have increased their budgets in advertising. They mislead children especially those who live in developing countries to believe that smoking is associated with maturate and easy life. They elaborate their advertisements not because they believe the information they try to deliver are true but because they attempt to lure those young people to be their customer all their lives. Even worse the U. S government has helped the tobacco companies to boost their sales in foreign countries by imposing those countries on opening their cigarette markets. Thus more people around the world have been affected by American cigarette. At this point my question is if a government uses its power to ruin the people's lives around the world. What kind of response you can expect from people abroad towards the U. S. Hereby I strongly recommend your admission of stopping the supports to those tobacco companies stopping their advertisements in any form around the world and stopping their attempts to tempt children. Thank you very much! Frank
