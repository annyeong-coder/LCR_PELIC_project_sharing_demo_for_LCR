By 1999 I had received a few awards about painting picture . But I hadn't interested painting. For 3 years I had been finding my interest. But I couldn't find my interest for my future's job. By 2002 I had found my interest and I had chosen my major. I had been learning Russian language for 2years. By 2006 I had never gone another country. I hadn't had courage about live another country before I came here. I've tried adept to Pittsburgh's life.
