I went to the movie theater last friday. The movie's name is Indiana Jones. I like ANON_NAME_0 Ford. Actually he's the actor who plays a leading actor in the movie. Also I like another one who plays Jones's son. He real name is Shia La Beouf. The movie which was directed by Steven Spielberg. In the movie are a lot of fantastic computer generated scenes which is made by Janusz Kaminski. There are a lot of people who I like people it is the reason why I like the movie.
