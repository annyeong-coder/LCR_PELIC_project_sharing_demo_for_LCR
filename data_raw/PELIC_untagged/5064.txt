When I started working for LG Cable my supervisor made a dinner party for me at the sushi restaurant. I was afraid of going there because I wasn't able to eat fresh fish. My family who often went to the sushi restaurant liked to eat fresh fish. When my family went to the sushi restaurant I usually ate some side dishes without sushi. I was really nervous because I knew that my supervisor must have persuaded me to eat fresh fish. I just avoided his eye and strived to eat a piece of cucumber and other side dishes. As my expectation he gave me a piece of sushi which was really big red one. I knew that I must not have swallowed without chewing. While I tried to chew a few pieces of sushi I needed to drink a lot of water for swallowing. I wasn't able to feel any taste. Even though I wanted to get out of the dinner party I stayed there for three hours. After that time I could eat any sushi without any force. Now I enjoy eating sushi and love to go to the Sushi Kim which is in Pittsburgh.
