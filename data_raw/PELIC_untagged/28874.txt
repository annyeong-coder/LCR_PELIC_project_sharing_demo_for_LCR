Hello Dear Sand I read your letter and I will be happy to help you. Being far away from your boyfriend is hard especially when you fall in love with him but in your case which is that you just spoke together once since he left you could call him again if that will make you feel better to know waht is your postion in his life. In the other hand he is the one that he should call you. However do not even think about quiting your job and go after your boyfriend. You have better keep your job if you are not sure about your relationship. I know I did not answer your questions but this is my advice to you.
