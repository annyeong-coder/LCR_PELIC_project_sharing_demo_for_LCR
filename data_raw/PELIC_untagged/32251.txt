My home is big and dark I should light it up to become brighter and when I look over the walls I find scratches over all the walls. I have to call in someone who experts and he or she will touch the walls up by a good paint. Also I have to make up some changes like as hang up some beautiful pictures and settle on bright colors to painting the walls. By doing this I will cheer myself up and I am counting on my budget to complete the repair. Finally I wish to get through it fast and clean up the mass to start over my normal life.
