I am planning to mojor in linguistics since it is one of my interests. This area has been my favorite subject since I graduated from high school. Now I am exerting myself to improve my Englsih better because I have to get high scores in any English proficiency test i. E. TOEFL OR IELTS. Most linguistics departments require 90 or higher on IBT that equals anout 7 on IELTS. ELI has given me a chance to practice what I have learned in my undergraduate school. It is said that practice is the only way to learn any language in a short period of time. Therefore speaking with native speakers is a practical way to do so. I hope I will be admitted mainly in Pitt if not other departments. Optimism is sometimes a way to cheer one's up so I try to be optimistic as much as I can.
