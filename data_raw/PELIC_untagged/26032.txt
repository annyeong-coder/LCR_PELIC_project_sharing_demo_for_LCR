Dear Mr. ANON_NAME_0 I am a student at the EFL Computer Training Institute. My classes are very good but the institute had better make some improvements or many students are going to leave. First I think you should change the broken window. Second you ought to repair the ceiling. Furthermore you should replace the carpet. Moreover you'd better buy some seats for people who are waiting for their job to be done. Finally you should buy a new copy machine because it is very old and also out of order.
