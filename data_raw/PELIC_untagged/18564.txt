I met my friend ANON_NAME_0 when we were living in La Serena which is my former hometown in Chile. ANON_NAME_0 and I were 12 years old and we spent our time playing soccer and watching T. V. After that when we were 19 we were living in Santiago because both were studying in that city we always went to a lot of parties and continued playing soccer. When we began to work we didn't see every weeks because we didn't have time on business days and the weekend we spent the time with ours girlfriend. Now we still are friend and we try to see one time a week.
