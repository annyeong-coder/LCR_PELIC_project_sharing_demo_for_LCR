There are three reasons the undergrad grill failed such as prices time and services. First they have higher prices for drinks. For example the lemonade in the undergrad grill restaurant cost for 4 dollars and the people in this area are students and employee so the drink prices were higher because the students do not have enough money and the other hand the employee take has lowest income they can not buy every day. Secondly they are open less than the other restaurants. They open 11 A. . M t o11 P. M. Usually students eat the breakfast very early 7 8 A. M. Same as employee so they will not eat them breakfast in the undergrad grill restaurant. Finally they have very strange services. They do not have service to take out so the people must eat at restaurant students and employee can not go out from the university and work in the same time.
