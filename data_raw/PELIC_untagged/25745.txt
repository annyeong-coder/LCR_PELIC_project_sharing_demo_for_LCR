UCTV The ethics of blame In this talk Prof. Thomas Scanlon presented his view on blame and its implication. There are the two main approaches to the nature of blame. One of them analyzes blame as a form of negative evaluation whereas the other regards blame as a kind of punishment. However Scanlon claimed that neither approach is plausible since they don't capture an important aspect of our experiences i. E. The personal aspect of blame and proposed his own view that blame is an impairment of a personal relationship. According to him to blame someone we have to have a certain personal relationship with her him e. G. Friendship and it sets a standard which we expect her him to follow. If her his action deviates from the standard we could blame her him and change our attitudes toward her him which results in an impairment of the relationship. Scanlon asserted that this approach to blame can accommodate the personal aspect of blame which other approaches cannot respect. Then he presented an implication of his approach to the question of whether we should avoid blaming someone or in some cases blaming is morally permissible. Based on his approach he rejected a view that we should always avoid blaming and claims there are some situation where blaming is acceptable.
