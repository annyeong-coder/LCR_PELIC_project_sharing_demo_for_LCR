I have thought about teaching physical training in high school. Since childhood I have liked athletics that use body. When I was ready to enter a unversity I thought about my future and my life decision. I wanted to be physical educator who can teach athletics but my parents opposed it very much. They hoped I would become a salary man so I am obliged to enter the statistics department.
