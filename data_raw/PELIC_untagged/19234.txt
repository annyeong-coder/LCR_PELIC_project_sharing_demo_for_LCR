I had an accident last year. First while I was driving to work and listening to the radio a person was crossing the road and I hit him because I didn't see him. Then I stopped my car and checked him and found he was bleeding from a head. After that I took him to hospital and he got better later. Finally I called the Police Office and told them what happened.
