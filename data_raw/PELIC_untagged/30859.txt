Friday vs Sunday In daily life we need to do many activities to make our lives colorful rather than always studying. As a student I am studying at school during Monday to Friday. I try my best to concentrate in classes but it is a little different on weekend especial on Friday and Sunday. As we know Friday is the last day of the workweek. Although I will have been distributed a lot of homework I am still getting excited because I will have two days off on weekend. I get up on Friday as usual and then go to school on time. After finishing my classes I sometimes meet my friends and have dinner out of house. We have a conversation and exchange our opinion about our study lives and latest trend. It has much fun with my friends. In evening I work hard on my homework and try my best to finish them as soon as possible so that I can play around on Saturday and Sunday crazily. In contrast I am more flexible and relax on Sunday. I usually get up very late until my friends who do not have cars call me and drive them to shopping in the daytime. Since I have already finished my homework on Friday I can do what I want to do after shopping back home. I sometimes do chores or watch movies with my husband or do some activities out of door. In evening I become a little bit down because I need to go to school next. I need to enjoy this beautiful life. Nevertheless I need to study hard for my future.
