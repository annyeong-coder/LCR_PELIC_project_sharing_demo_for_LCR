The worst meal experience I've ever had occurred in Egypth next summer. I was there in vacation with my mother. Everything had a horrible taste bacause of the spice they use like the cumino. I weren't able to eat a lot but bread and some dishes. Expecially the vegetables which is my favorite course were so foul. Yet I tried to eat something while other people didn't eat almost anything for a week at least. Everybody came back home thinner.
