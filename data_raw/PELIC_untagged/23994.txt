Effect of the Recession for Japanese Economy For two years Japanese people have lived with the anxious for the future. We haven't found the end of recent recession yet. The recent recession of the world economy have critical effects for Japanese economy such as export industry and employment. The first impact is the decrease of export. Because Japanese economy deeply depends of exports industry especially car and electronic machines the decrease of export has serious impact on Japanese economy. For two years annual reports of almost of Japanese major companies reported their deficits. The second impact is the raise of unemployment ratio. As a result of decline of exports many companies raid off their employees. For recent 20 years Japanese industrial companies have increased the ratio of part time workers to maximize their profit. After the recession started a lot of part time workers lost their job. Sometimes they lived in the dormitories which companies prepare for their workers and they lost both their jobs and places to live in. To work as a part time worker is not always sustainable. The recent economic status reveals the weakness of this kind of works. As a result of the recession Japanese economy has serious problem. It is difficult to be an optimist in such time. However this time could be the opportunity to reinforce the framework of our society.
