If I won 10000 I would buy some things I really want. If I bought a digital camera it would cost me 300. Also I would buy a laptop for myself if I found a laptop which I want. If I bought a laptop it would cost me 1200. Besides that if I had enough money I would visit Japan again. If I visited Japan I would go to Tokyo and Hokkaido. I want to enjoy the scenery there and buy some fashionable things. If I went to Tokyo I would call my friend who I knew her for five years. She would take me to everywhere I want if she had free time. We could enjoy different kinds of Japanese food and afternoon tea if we wanted. I can image if I went to Japan it would be a wonderful vocation!
