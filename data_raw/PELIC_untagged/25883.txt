Mary was a soul mate whom I was looking for! She is friendly and a quite person. My soul mate is someone that I can have fun and talk about serious things. I arrived in America when she was out the country. Because that I stayed live in the University that was very noise. I used to live in a quite house in my country where I always was relax because that I don't like to much noise. Mary is who cooking every day. She is cooking very well. I'm the person who clean the house and share home activities with her. One thing that I fell hard is to learn English. English is the second language that my country require for to get a good job.
