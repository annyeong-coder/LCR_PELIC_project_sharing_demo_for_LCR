I met my friend Maja from Argentinia at the ELS here in PITT while I was attending an English course. I will never forget the first day when we met. She was sitting in the classroom and smiling to me when I entered the room. We shaked hands and introduced each other. While the teacher was explaining about the ELS organisation and how we were graded we continued chatting. Suddenly the teacher warned us to stop talking and to listen carefully. Of course we stopped talking. After the introduction of ELS we went to a restaurant were we ate lunch together while explaining our country and culture each other. We have been in contact since that day we met. We call each other once a week.
