No if you don't cite. If you don't cite where the material is from whatever it has a copyright symbol or not it is not permitted. As long as you take materials you must cite. It has nothing to do with a copyright symbol. If you don't cite readers who read your article would think that is your idea or something actually it is not which will hurt and cheat the original author. It is unfair for the authentic author this is his her accomplishments.
