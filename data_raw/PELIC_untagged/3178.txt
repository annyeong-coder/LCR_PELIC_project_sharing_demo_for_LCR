My mother WHO LIVES IN JAPAN likes gardening. She always read a lot of books of flowers WHICH ARE BLOOMING IN HER GARDEN. My sister WHO LIVED IN BOSTON FIVE YEARS AGO sent me a package every month. Now she takes care of two children in JAPAN. My another sister WHO IS A RESERCHER talks to me one a week. She is a very friendly person. My brother WHO WORKS IN A POST OFFICE has two children. They live in with my mother WHO LIKES FLOWERS. They are necessary people for me to live in the U. S.
