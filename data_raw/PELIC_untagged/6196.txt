Before I lived with ma aunt but there was too far. I pick out my apartment. My apartment is close to school. Every morning some people show up the music at first floor. Also the people straighten up at first floor. They keep on singing even though many people stay at first floor. They set up newspaper we can see every day as well. Every morning that is cheering me up. However every day I get up late. Sometimes I leave my house key out at home. At that time I call my roommate.
