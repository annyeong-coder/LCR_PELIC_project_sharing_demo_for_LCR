If I were going to start a business I think I would not have the courage to use such an unconventional way as Roddick did. For example I will not start my business when I do not have money. I think it is very dangerous to run a business without enough finance. I could not image what I should do if I failed to my business when I put all my money in my business. In addition I think I would package my products well and delicately. I believe that elegant packaging can attract customers to buy my products. However encouraging customers to recycle bottles or to bring containers to refill are good ways for a company to save cost and to protect our environment. Some of her ideas could be learned to operate a business even though they might not be unconventional.
