a friend in need is a friend indeed. I think it means a friend who helps you anytime you need him or her. I have a friend whose name is ANON_NAME_0. ANON_NAME_0 is someone that I can rely on. We used to live in Makkah which we both born in. His house that is always opened for me is near from my house. There are many situations which ANON_NAME_0 was there for me.
