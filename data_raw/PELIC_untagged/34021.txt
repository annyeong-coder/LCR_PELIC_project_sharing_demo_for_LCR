Dear Xavi I recommend you that you should live in Pittsburgh because the environment to study English is pretty good. First there is no earthquake which you worried may happened here. Although in summer the weather is usually hot but it good to go out or do outdoor activity in weekend with beautiful sunny day. Sometimes it is rainy but not continued for long time. Furthermore if you are interested in sport game you can enjoy the baseball game and football game here! Despite losing many times formerly this season the baseball team Pirates have gotten good grade in recent games. Come to Pittsburgh to support them win the games in MLB! The principal reason I think Pittsburgh is good to live is that is a secure city and are not crowded all the time. This is a lush city lot of trees can be founded everywhere. If you want go outside there are lots of parks can go picnic play frisbee whatever you want and you can also make friends with residents in some activities they are kind and also can help you improve your English. You can enjoy the blue sky lush trees and cordial people in Pittsburgh! Hope my suggestion can help you. Sincerely Dora
