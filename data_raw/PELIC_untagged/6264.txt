My room is large but it's not cheer me up so I looked my room over then I figure out why my room bring me up. First I don't like my wall's color. The wall is white but I want to change it. If the wall is green or pink I feel more energy. Also I will hang up some beautiful pictures on the wall and take off old clock. Next I need more warm atmosphere. I will pick out green plants on the desk. Additionally I need more lamp which light my room up. Finally I have to straight up my desk. I'll put away a lot of books and papers on the desk. Then I'll throw out trash my room will be clean warm and bring me up.
