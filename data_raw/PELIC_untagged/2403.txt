There have been many world events that effect tourism for several decades. Such effect however can boost up or decline tourism business in many countries. In some countries tourism plays the important role in its economy so it is important to foster the positive effect such as an international meeting cultural events and traveling campaigns. Also we need to keep a watchful eye on every event that might lead to adverse effects on tourism such as unrest political unrest terrorism and economic instability. International meeting can enhance tourism. For example when international event occurs in a certain country there will be a lot of country leaders or famous political figures traveling to that country to join the meeting or conference. It is inevitable that there must be a television broadcast to other countries around the world Hence at this time such country holding the event can use this opportunity to present their culture and place to travel and launch its traveling campaigns. However we have to prevent unpleasant events. The world is facing the problem of terrorism for example. In southern part of Thailand the tourism has gradually declined since 2005 because of a bomb treat and daily assassination which scare the tourist away. Likewise In the United States the twin tower tragedy shocked the world and make traveling inward and outward the United States more difficult than that in the past. Apart from this I agree with the prediction that china will be the leader of tourism industry in the near future. China has developed continuously for many years. Therefore people around the world probably want to visit China to see its innovation and technology.
