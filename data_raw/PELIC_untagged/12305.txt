I don't think that the author clearly state if children are to learn to keep deadline of their tasks but the author is in favor of giving enough time to children in learning so that they can fall and go in the flows. For this reason I will choose the answer is False . I agree with the author that children need time and it takes time in learning because each child has own rate of progressing. But I think learning a sense of completing task on time should be taught at the same time. It is because children will face heavier schedules and more subjects day by day so if they are not disciplined in managing time they will undergo lots of frustration and confusion. Also well balanced life is closely associated with well time management so I think learning to complete tasks on time is very crucial elements in children's education.
