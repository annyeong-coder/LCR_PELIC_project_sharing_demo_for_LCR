First McCrae's team began with two groups of NEO PI R surveys that they had collected in different countries. They produced two profiles one where the volunteers rated their own personality and another where the volunteers rated the personalities of other individuals they knew. A third survey was conducted in about 50 countries where the volunteers described a typical person from their country. The result reflected the national stereotype.
