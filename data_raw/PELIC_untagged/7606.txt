I got on the local train from Kyoto to Osaka to see my friend 10 years ago. I was sitting on the seat and waiting for the departure because the station I got on the train was the original station. I found a white rope passing in front of my face and suddenly my neck was compressed. I noticed someone was behind me and tried to throttle me with the rope. I was so scared that I tried to scream but I couldn't say anything. Fortunately one young man sitting close to my seat noticed me and ran to me to help me. The culprit said something I couldn't understand in a very loud voice and ran away. The young man and I went to see the conductor and explained the situation. After five minutes the policeman arrived at the train and asked me whether I could remember the face of the culprit. Actually I had no idea because he was standing behind me and I never saw his face. We started searching the culprit in the train. When we entered the next car I found a man with the white rope in his pocket. He was arrested and taken to the police office. Of course the train couldn't depart the station. He was investigated and the police made contact with his family. After the investigation I met the police and he reported about the culprit. According to the policemen the culprit turned out to be suffered from mental disease and he had escaped from the hospital. Eventually he was released and taken to the hospital because the police can't arrest the person who has mental aberration. After I came back home parents of the man visited my house and apologized for their son. I told them I was fine because I was just glad I could escape from being killed. I've never forgotten this accident and the accident could teach me we never know what happens in our life.
