IMy favorite memory is that I came to America last year. Because it was firt time I travel by myself every things are very fresh for me. In addition I went to school and knew new friends who came from all kinds of country. Chicago which is very beautiful city is my first memory. My friend and I saw the basketball game which is one of my favorite sports and I enjoied the American profession sport. After watching the game we went to downtown to eat deepdish pizza which has over 100 history in Chicago. I also expericenced America tradition holiday which is Thanksgiving and ate turkey. This January I transferd to Pitt and enjoied different cultures . I like America very much because I can expericence all kinds of cultures and meke many friends.
