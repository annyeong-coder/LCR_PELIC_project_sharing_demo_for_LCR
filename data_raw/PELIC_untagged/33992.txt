In fact Melissa did not like my advice because it does not fit her personality. There I tried to give her another one. I told her If you fell down you would pretend that you are collecting things from the flour . She told me that she could not take an immediate reaction to a sudden surprise. However that my friend and I know her if she fell down she will scream loudly and make everyone feel sympathy towards her
