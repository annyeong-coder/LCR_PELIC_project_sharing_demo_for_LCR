Topic The traditional music of my country. I think the traditional music in my country is Taiwanese music. It's different about Chinese music. Because in Taiwan We have two languages one is Chinese and you can use in Taiwan and in China the other is Taiwanese. Let me introduce about Taiwanese song and music. Now in Taiwan you still can hear some popular songs sometimes you can hear them on the TV or radio. And how about the music and songs sound like I think this kind of traditional tunes. Some of them come from Japan. The others were made by some Taiwan composers. Especially my father my grandma their generation likes them very much. I don't know why. They just like it. Now our generation doesn't like this kind of songs or music. But I still like some. When my friends or my family have a birthday or we want to celebrate something sometimes we will go to the karaoke by the time we still will order some Taiwanese traditional songs to celebrate a important thing together. It seems to be an essential thing when we in the karaoke club or restaurant. This is a famous leisure activity in Taiwan. Now in Taiwan some TV program still will have a competition about the Taiwanese song. Many entries will sing some of the masterpieces when they choose the song. I think this is one part of Taiwan's culture in the Taiwanese music and songs.
