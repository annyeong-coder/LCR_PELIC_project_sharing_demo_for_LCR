My Old Green Car indent My old green car is my heart. I love it as much as any old friend. When I see its green color I should feel comfortable like when I set in a wonderful dark green garden. It had seats soft as water. I was never tired when I sat on it as long as I was. Also I always remember that when I drove my old car it feel smooth as cold cream. It was driving very quiet like an ant. You couldn't hear any sound from it. When I consider about spending gas in my car I must find it very economical. It was wellspring that was taking a long time until the gas wrap up. It really has good characteristics that few cars have. Its headlight was the full moon that it was clarify every thing front of me wherever I was. It was like gun's sound in its speed. When I had to go any where quickly it was helping me to arrive on time. I was listening to plenty of tapes and CDs from my car's clear stereo system. It was like bird's warble among trees' forest in the morning. I will never forget my old green car in the whole my life.
