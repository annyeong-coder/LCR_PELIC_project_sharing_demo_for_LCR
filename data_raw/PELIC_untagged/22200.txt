Thai culture focuses on relatives the dead relatives and older relatives are very important. So we have the holiday about relatives. It is Sung Grand Day. This holiday we want the younger to remember and know about dead relatives and older relatives. This holiday is on April 12 to 14 of every year. On the long holiday families go back to their hometown to celebrate dead relatives. Next older relatives are honored by them. Finally they have a party with other people and relatives. In the morning we celebrate dead relatives. First a lot of food water and flowers are prepared by us. After that we go to the temple and send food water and flowers to the monks because we believe that the relatives get them. When the monks finish eating the food we take the food back and eat it because we believe that we get the good luck. Then we go to the graves of dead relatives clean the graves and cover the graves with flowers. After we finish celebrating at the temple. We go back to the home and we begin to honor the older relatives. First we prepare special water because we use it to honor the older relatives. We start by put the water in the bowl. Next we put a lot of petals in it. Then we put Nam Ob Thai type of scent in the bowl. After that it is poured by younger person to the older person's hand and something good is said by the older person to younger person. When we finish celebrating older relatives the young relatives poured the water together. So this is good time for young boys make relationships with young girls. In the afternoon a lot of rice vegetable meat and fish are prepared by us for the party. We cook a lot of Thai food but we don't have special food for this day. However we eat a lot of food drink dance and talk all night with relatives and friends. When the celebration ends older person might give money or gifts to younger person. So this celebration requires money food water and relationships. It is wonderful and important for my relatives and Thai culture.
