Forrest Gump the film which I watched many years ago is still my best favorite. The film is about a man whose IQ is lower than average level. However he got great success when he was a student and then severed in army. He even became a successful fisherman after he left his unit. The audiences may attribute his success to his good luck especially when he showed his sports talent and so on and so forth. But I do not think there is a simple answer to his legendary life. His characteristics including honest loyalty and patience contribute a lot to his fortunate life. His love to ANON_NAME_0 a girl who has been his been friend since he met her on the bus to school won her love eventually. Unfortunately ANON_NAME_0 passed away due to illness. It gave me a strong impression that there are too many unpredictable changes during our lives which is similar as Forrest said in the film life is a box of chocolate you will never know which is the next one.
