Last decade restaurants dramatically spread to reach everywhere in the world. This competition significantly contribute into increasing international restaurants quality. This is apparent in the big and modern cities where enormous percentage of consumers. In Pittsburgh in which I live there are many international restaurants. Indeed there are two restaurants that I prefer Hukydo and Indian Garden. These restaurants have many advantages however there are some differences between them. These differences make me easily decide where I should eat. This contrast will be discussed in terms of meal price dessert and appetizers and a restaurant atmosphere. The most important difference between Hukydo and Indian Garden though is the price difference. Lunch for one person at Indian Garden without drink would almost cost 20 dollars however it doesn't include tipping a waiter. At Hukydo lunch for everyone will cost around 7 dollars include drink and desserts. Also sometimes they serve salad fruit. Obviously with the extra 13 dollars I could eat at Hukydo three more times. Thus eating at Hukydo would help me to save money. Many restaurants offer free dessert to attract consumers Hukydo restaurant is one of these restaurants whereas Indian Garden doesn't offer any kind of dessert. There are many kind of dessert which you will find when you decide to eat at Hukydo restaurant. Thus it is a perfect restaurant for those who love dessert. Restaurant atmosphere is important to me and that why I prefer Hukydo restaurant. Hukydo atmosphere enjoyable which help me to get relax particularly in the weekend after hard working. It is location gives. On the other hand Indian Garden restaurant located on main street consequently unsuitable atmosphere as well as unhealthy. In conclusion' for all reasons I stated above and after careful consideration it thought to be a good decision when I choose Hukydo. It is more enjoyable than Indian Garden as well as cheaper.
