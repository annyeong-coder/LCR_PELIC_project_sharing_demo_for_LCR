I think that one of the most important decision I've made in my life was the choice of the University. When I graduated from Hight School I was 18 years old and I was confused about my future. My father wanted me to become an engineer but my dream was to become a medical doctor. I thought a lot before taking that decision but finally I decided to start the School of Medicine. I'm sure I've made the right choice but sometimes I wish I could know what would've happened if I had made a different decision. If I were an engineer I wouldn't know too many things about diseases and maybe I would be less Hypochondriac! But let's think of my private life. If I hadn't attended the School of Medicine I wouldn't have met a lot of important persons such as my fiance and the majority of my friends. My life would be boring if I hadn't met my friend Anna and I wouldn't be here in Pittsburgh if I hadn't met my fiance. If I had followed my father's advice I would be a different person because I would have made different experiences but although I don't believe in the destiny I like to think that in my parallel life something would have been the same.
