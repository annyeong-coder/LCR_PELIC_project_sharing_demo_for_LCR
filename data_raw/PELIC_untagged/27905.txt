What are the talents or skills that you possess that will help you to succeed in your career Find the right career might be the huge challenge for most of students. If you want to look for good salary jobs you have to equip with outstanding skills and talents. Before you offer your application form you should take some time to think about what skills and talents do you have. To me I want to be a lawyer. The most important skill needed to be a lawyer is knowledgeable. If you want to be a lawyer you must be trained in law schools. I have been studying law in a law school for 4 years. I know the laws roles and I could help you understand what rights do you have. The second skill that I have is the language. I was growing and rising in china so I could speak and write Chinese. I could not only help the Chinese but also American. The third skill I have is that I am interested in business. When I was a college student I went to a international bank in China as a manager's assistant. I like this experience because it made me fall in love with financial and told me how to use law in financial. I also taken some business classes like accounting class stock class and manage class. I also read some business classes like The art of choosing Too big to fail and so on. In my opinion I think lawyer is the hardest career in the world because when you are a lawyer you present the sells the customs the victims the witness but yourself. In actually to be a lawyer needs enormous skills like analyzing knowledgeable and you should good at arguing. I have these skills but I still need to learn more to be a good lawyer.
