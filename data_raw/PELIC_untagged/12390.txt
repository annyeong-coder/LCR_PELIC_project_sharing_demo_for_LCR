On April 15 Tom Higgins opened a new restaurant at Benson University. He was certain his restaurant would do well because his restaurant was surrounded by many other restaurants and over 25 000 students were looking for a place to eat. However the number of customer was decreasing and eventually his restaurant failed. Here are two main reasons why the restaurant failed. First he didn't have enough money to do much advertising. The advertising informs something to consumer so the good advertising is affected the better result. Even if restaurant is so good people will not know there without advertising. At that time the advertising helps it inform to people. To succeed his restaurant he should have done much advertising. Next it is important for the restaurant to provide good quality food and adequate price. Even though the price is very cheap if the food is so terrible the people never come to the restaurant. Because he did not hired professional cooks his restaurant was failed. He did not the advertising and did not provide the good food so the number of customer was decreasing and his restaurant failed.
