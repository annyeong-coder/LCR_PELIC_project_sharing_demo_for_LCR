The most of people depend on the optimism that makes them happy to see to the future but that leads them to failure if they depend on that only. First people should be optimistic but they must work hard to obtain their target Second they should to use experiences of other people who had passed in their live. Finally they should not to stop on the old mistakes but they should to use that as example. The optimism is good thing but we can't depend on it to be succeed.
