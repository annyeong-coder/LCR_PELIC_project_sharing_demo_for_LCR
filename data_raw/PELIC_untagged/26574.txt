I'm living in Monroeville and I have to get up at 6 30 every morning so every morning I got up late. For my get up first things is brush my teeth and then eat breakfast. I usually eat toast or cereal for my breakfast. My aunt drive me to school every morning. On my school way is usually rush time and always have traffic jam.
