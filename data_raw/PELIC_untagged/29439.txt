1. When the semester ends in the ELI I will take a vacation term. 2. If I am not allowed to have a vacation term due to my visa status I will consider taking only a couple of classes as a part time student. 3. Unless the immigration law changes there will be no problem for me to become a part time student because this is my third semesters as a full time student in the United States. 4. In case I fail to get accepted by any graduate school I am considering going back to Korea in order to change my visa status into F2 which is for the spouse of a foreign student studying in the United States. 5. However it will be the worst option I can imagine now because I really do want to keep my studying. 6. After finishing an MA in rhetoric or communications. I will apply for a doctoral degree. 7. As soon as earnign a doctoral degree I will give myself vacation as a reward for hard working. 8. Once my husband finishes his study we will have a child. 9. Before having a child however we are going to have a trip which might not be possible for a while after becoming parents. 10. Although I know that life does not go as planned what an important thing in the journey of our life is not struggle to achieve but enjoy everying I can have at every moment.
