My strength and weakness point as a writer I have a strength and weakness point when I write about something. My weakness point is that I always use same words and phrases. I am not good at using new words and phrases so my writing is always boring. I want to study new vocabularies and phrases and I should study them. I was really interested in writing. So this is my strength point. I want to study them so I will try to read many things like a newspaper magazines or some books. Last weekend my boyfriend gave me some newspaper when I was boring. My boyfriend said to me reading newspaper is really fun because we can get some information and we do not have to read all of them. I read them it was a little difficult for me but it was really fun. Rob told us if we read more and more we could improve writing better than now. I think it is really important for me and I have my good strength point. So this semester I will try to keep reading something and improve my writing skills.
