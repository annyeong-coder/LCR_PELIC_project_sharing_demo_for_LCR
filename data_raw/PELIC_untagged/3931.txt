Center Working Mothers Why Not indent Nowadays more and more women work outside the home causing many people to question whether this is a positive change. Many people are against mothers working. However they have weak evidence for their arguments. There are many financial and social benefits for working. Mothers can work without having a negative effect on the family. Indent Some people might say if she works for the money money is not so important. The salaries of some men are not enough for the home and other expenses. So the salary of the wife will be helpful for her family. She doesn't have to take the kids to baby care centre. Teenagers don't need care like children however. So her money won't be spent all. Indent Moreover other people say that working women's can affect personality negatively. However working outside the home gives woman self confidence and a sense of own personal identity. A woman who stays at home will always be known as someone's wife and not as a person in her own right. Indent Some people will say kids and teenagers should stay just with their parents or not with strange people. In my opinion mothers can work part time so they can do some good work and she can stay with her children. She might also arrange the working time with her husband so they can be with the kids most of the time. One point in favor of mothers working is that their children often learn to be independent from an early age which can only help them in the future. Indent To sum up there are many arguments both for and against mothers working. Every family is different and what is good for one family may not necessarily be good for another. Taking everything into account it should be left to the individual mother to decide whether working or not is something that she wants to do.
