Jan 28 2009 Teresa Are foreign movies a good way to learn about a different country or culture Describe why they are or are not. In my opinion it's a best way to learn different culture from other countries. There are some different things between my culture and foreigner's such as taking shower in the morning wearing shoes to get inside the house etc. In my country we usually take shower before the bed and it's dirty to wear shoes in the house. We can tell the different ways in behavior from movies. Moreover we can learn America's history from National Treasure we will know their presidents' names after seeing even the history isn't correct. Or we can know American's school life or their concept of sex from American Pie . Maybe the story is full of exaggerations but we can know their details in behavior and food etc. I strongly suggest who wants to learn the different culture from other countries you don't need to get there you can learn by sitting on your seat.
