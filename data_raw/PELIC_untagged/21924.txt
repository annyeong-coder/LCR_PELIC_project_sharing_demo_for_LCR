Hi everyone my name is ANON_NAME_0 Last Name and I am form Saudi Arabia. I am trying to introduce myself to you. At first I will talk about my experience and my hobbies.

In general I like to make a plan for my ideas for that usually I write my plan each day after that I assess my doing. In these days I study English in ELI to improve my skills and in the same time I am looking for acceptance to study Master degree in MBA.
