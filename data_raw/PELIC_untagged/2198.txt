The Winter Garden in the World Financial Center is an abundant spacious place. During last break I visited the World Financial Center in New York City. It is a building stuck with glassy skin. When I look at it from outside it is like a couple of giant crystal pole standing adjacent the Hudson River on West Street. By its reflective surface I can distinctly see that it wraps up with the scenery of the city. When I pass through the entrance a spacious hall appeared in front of my eyes. Then I found although I was interior the hall named Winter Garden is like an outdoor caf po the space. All the trees neon light as vines and stairs as a waterfall makes the Winter Garden become a tropical forest.
