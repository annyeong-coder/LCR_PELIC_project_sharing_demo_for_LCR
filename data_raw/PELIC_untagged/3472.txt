People may study at home and they are not going to go to school in the future. It's good idea to not go to school because we can go any school. Now sometimes we should go to school which we can go from our home for financial reason or other reasons. However if we don't have to go school we can choose any schools all over the world. In addition some people who have some problems about their body can also study at their home or even in hospitals. I think studying with computer could help those people. In stead it might have negative points. For example they don't have to go school so they will not meet their classmates. They can be not good at to communicate each other and they can not learn important things to increase emotions in their childhood. I think it may be the biggest problem in the future. We should study well with using computer and we should not lose communication. It's difficult to solve the problems and make our education program better. However if we can do both of them well our education can be good for everyone.
