The conversation suggests the way to avoid verbal conflict is not giving anger for anger. The guest said people shouldn't things negatively and pay attention on how other say to you. The guest gave the example of two sisters Rosa and Alicia whose mother had death. Without her will the problem of division of inheritance between them was created. Rosa said Alicia had been always received things from mother. Alicia felt uncomfortable with what Rosa said so she responded Rosa was so selfish. As a result the conflict was expanded. To avoid this kind of situation the guest suggests Alicia should have told her feeling rather than taking her anger back. For example I feel so sorry to hear that said the guest. By not return anger to anger is the method that people can use to delight their collision.
