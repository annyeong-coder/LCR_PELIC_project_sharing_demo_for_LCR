Dear Mr. ANON_NAME_0 I am a student at ELI Computer Training Institute. My classes are very good but the institute had better make some improvements or many students are going to leave. First I think you should repair photocopier. Second I think you ought to clean up the classroom. Third maybe you should make a schedule for using the PC. Forth perhaps you should not allow bring any drinks or food inside the classroom. Finally I think you ought to empty the trash.
