When I lived in Taiwan I often slept at around 10 o'clock every night so sometimes I was disturbed by phone calls. Someday my best friend called me while I was sleeping. Then I waked up to pick up the phone call. However my voice sounded very angry so he just spoke around 1 minute and said that he was going to hang up the phone. Then I went on sleeping. However when I got up in the morning I was worry that I did something bad to my friend. Therefore I called him back and apologized for my behavior. He said that it was okay because he could figure out the situation. It is the experience I have had on phone
