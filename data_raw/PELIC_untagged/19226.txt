It was a cold night in December 2007 when I was working late in my shop. I had put my wallet on the counter and emptied my pockets before I swept and mopped the floor to avoid getting it wet after I had finished cleaning I grabbed a trash bag in witch I put all the garbage and took it outside to the garbage container on the street's corner and tossed it. Early morning in the next day I woke up and went to some governmental department to take care of some taxation paperwork but not until the official asked for some ID did I check my wallet It really was a big shock when I didn't find it. I tried to remember where I put it but in vain and while I was driving back to the shop I remembered and hurried up to the garbage container. The trash truck got there at the same time and the guy was stunned to see me inside the container after I had looked for a couple of minutes I found it and was so happy despite the horrible smell coming out of me.
