I met one of my best friends during an exchange trip in Germany. Nile was one year younger than me but we used to hang out in the weekends with some of my other friends. The first time we met us I was riding the bus back home we sat together and started to get to know each other. One time we organized a black white party and spent the money we won in a expensive restaurant. We ate a well served steak with baden potatoes. However the worst part was that I was leaving within 6 months and we wouldn't see us after that. And that was what happened we lost contact and we never spoke again.
