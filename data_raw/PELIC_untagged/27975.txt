The essay made me feel sorry for many things. First AL who I think lived tow parts of life one is too bad and the other is kind of dependantly happy. Second Jake with all pain he felt and the impending demis . Third Jess who is the cute nice smart girl and how she'd feel when she knows about the demis of Jake. What made me thought about was the great number of feelings in the story. It mixes many feelings together. Personally I hate to be in a sad situation after very happy one. AL is sure that theses moments must happen soon for his beloved girl when Jeck passes away. It is hard to think and know of somehing bad will happen and you can't change or eliminate the damage would happen for people you like. Moreover I like his words how nice to be a dog sometimes I myself imagine that I need to be a child agian. I don't like all responsibilites on me and sometimes I get tired of them. Also the author uses many descriptive language and emotional words.
