In my opinion you shouldn't tell him about your feelings. You have just started the relationship 4 month ago and it is a short time so you must be more patient. You may think about moving to Minnesota and live with him but he didn't ask you to do that if he really loves you. You had better keep your job and start to make new friends. You already called him and if he cares about you he might call you and ask you to live with him. SAND don't let any bad feelings bothers you. You have a good job and you could find the person who deserves your sacrifice. Best wishes Chatty
