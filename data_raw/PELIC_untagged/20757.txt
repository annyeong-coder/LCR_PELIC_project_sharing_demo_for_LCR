One day someone called me at night and woke me up. He kept on talking about his traveling plan and I tried to talk over with him but I was really sleepy and didn't sure that how much longer I could hold on. So I asked him who he is and he gave me a strange name. It turned out that he got a wrong number and I thought he was someone else. Finally I ended up this phone call and fell sleep again.
