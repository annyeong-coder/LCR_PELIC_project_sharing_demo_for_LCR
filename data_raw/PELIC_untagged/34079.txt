Three months ago my life has lately changed a lot . I used to live in a big house and rely on the housekeeper to clean my room. Nowadays I've been in Pittsburgh since May . I 've been living alone . I've already depended on myself to clean my room. I lived in Okland last month . I moved from Okland area at June. I 've lived in Shady side area for a month. I've started learning English since May . I've visited many places in Pittsburgh for fun . I went to Ohio River last week . I 've never been to Niagra Falls . I ve visited Cedor Point already . I still haven't prepared to the final exams in the ELI this semester . I 've already improved my English language . I haven't gotten the ILETS exam yet . I've bought Tofel Gide recently . I hope to get high score in Tofel test .
