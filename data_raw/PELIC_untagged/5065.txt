The worst meal that I have ever had was bout two years ago. It was very succulent and delicious meal but the dilemma was not inside the meal. It was at the place where I've had my meal. I was invited to a big dinner at my friend's home. The occasion was that he graduated from the university. Inevitably there were a lot of people in the party. Two things have made it the worst meal I've ever had. At the party I met my friend's father who I have ever met. My friend introduced me to his father. He introduced me as the closest friend to him. Due to he introduced me like that and I've never met his father I was very embarrassing. Why haven't you introduced him to me before his father said. Moreover when it was time to eat the dinner I was trying to take a piece of cake my cell phone rang and I dropped the cake on my clothes. As a result my face got red and I felt that I want to cry. After that I directly left the party even I didn't tell my friend that I'm going to leave. In short I hope that I will never have like this situation in the future. Also I don't want anyone else experience this bad circumstance because it is really an embarrassing situation.
