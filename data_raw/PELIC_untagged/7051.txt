I agree that always telliing the truth is the most important consideration in any relatonship. I used to don't tell the truth many times because sometimes I thought it was right. Whever I saw persons who look sad or feeling bad I wanted to cheer them up. Because of me their feeling is better I satistied it. However since I had one problem with my girlfreind I changed my thinking. When I met my girlfreiend I did't cosider the truth. I only thought about her feeling and condition because I did't want to break a mood even though it did not matter it was true or not true. When I met her she told me many times that her parents like me so her parents want me to meet. I was so happy because I though that it means her parent admit her boyfriend. I wanted to meet her parents then I wanted them to introduce as fast as a possible but whever I asked to my girlfreind she rejected it and seemed nervous. She told me that her parents was busy. I had belived her because she looked hidden something. Oneday she told me that she wanted to break up with me. The reason was her parent s didn't like me. I asked her your parents liked me. She said she didn't want to see
