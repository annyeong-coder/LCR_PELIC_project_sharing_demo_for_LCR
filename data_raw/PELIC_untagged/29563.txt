The children need to study lots of manners when they were young. In China the parents need to say thank you when they get the staff which they want. Second they need to learn that when the parents or other older people are talking they can't interrupt them this is a rude behavior. Third is that if they taken a public transportation like bus subway etc. They need to give their seat to the elder which means who's age is over 70. If the children have been taught that they should not speak loud in the public places and don't spilt on the street. When the kids want to the school they should not call teacher's name this is not respectful in China you should call them just teacher or professor . When you are having a class you have some problems that you can't understand you can't interject the teacher if you have questions you should ask them after the class. When you eat the food with other people use the chopisticks you should not pick the food everywhere in the dish just focus on your side.
