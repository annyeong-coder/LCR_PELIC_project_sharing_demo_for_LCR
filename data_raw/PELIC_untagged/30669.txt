By the end of 2009 I had finished my bachelor degree. Before I finished my bachelor degree I had never felt like this freedom from books. At that moment I felt tired I had been studying for 5 years in the university. After that I though about continue my education in the U. S . When I came here by the end of 2010 I had never seen the snow . It was in the winter I had never skied in the snow . It was a good experince.
