Ideal Neighbor There are no ideal nieghbor in the whole world. Human is not perfect at all. For me the ideal neoghor is cheerful helpful and reliable. It does not matter if he is neaty or messy I don't care about that. The most important thing that his childer don't do any noisily. The ideal neibor is funny and doesn't take every thing sirously.
