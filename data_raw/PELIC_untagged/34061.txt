In my opinion if a person regulate his work he will acquire more leisure time. To illustrate this he should divide his time appropriately to get free time and he could work comfortably without hard work. For example when I have a lot of work such as institute's homework TOEFL's study and house's work I do all institute's homework and finish my house's work during week days and I delay other work like TOEFL's study until a weekend. Thus I obtain some time which I spend to do my favorite things such as calling my family watching TV and drinking coffee.
