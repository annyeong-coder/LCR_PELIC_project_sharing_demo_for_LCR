You can't please everyone. Because when you make someone happy you make someone sad. I can't find any story about this but life is generally like this. For example my life is like this. When you plan to go to somewhere with so many people it is very hard to find something to do or somewhere to go that everybody wants. And if you are the planner you got unpleased while you are trying to please others. Or if you spend a lot of time with your friends you make your parents sad because they want to share time with you.
