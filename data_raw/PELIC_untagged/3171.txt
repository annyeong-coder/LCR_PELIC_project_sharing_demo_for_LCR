In my opinion improving air quality is the most important issue in theses days. It takes large spaces in discussing from environmental authorities at all countries. They take care for this issue because the air is the life. If you don't live in clear air area your life should be in dangerous situation. There are a lot of diseases in the world caused by air infections. Also no plants and birds with air infection. In addition seas and rivers will be dirty with the air infection. Therefore we must try to keep the air clear or at least decrease the infection by some wisdom decides such as put all factories away from cities. Also planting plenty of trees contributes to decline the air infection. Finally guide people to how to deal with the air and keep it fresh.
