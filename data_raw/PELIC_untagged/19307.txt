PARALLEL I'm afraid of driving in Pittsburgh since the roads of this city are very complicated. Especially in downtown there are a lot of parallel crossing. I'm very confused when I drive there facing several parallel roads. Sometimes I watch the screen of my GPS in parallel with monitoring I also need to watch the parallel roads. It's only a few seconds for me to decide which road is right and frequently I make a wrong choice. Recently I want to improve the speed of parallel reaction and I have made some progress for example I can make a parallel parking more quickly than before!
