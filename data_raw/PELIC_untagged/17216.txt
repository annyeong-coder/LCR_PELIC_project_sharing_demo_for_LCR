John Lennon who used to be songwriter and singer of the most famous Rock and Roll group The Beatles wrote a song Image which represented the strong desire toward peace. To some extent Mr. Lennon shares the same idealism without greed and hunger in the world with me. It's definitely a severe challenge for everyone who breathe and stands on the Mother Earth as well as a possible mission which is worth to pursuit entire life. Maybe skeptics who always believe nothing will doubt this statement and judge the unfairness is inerasable. As Gettysburgh Address however Mr. Lincoln conceived the proposition of equality all men are created equal. This concept solidifies our faith and enhances our courage to eliminate the present unbalance and reserve a better world for the offspring.
