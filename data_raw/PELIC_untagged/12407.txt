In June 2005 was my favorit trip. This trip was in my countary regions that area is a mountaining place. My friend and I decided to spend one week in three cities. Befor we travel I said we must make a list for the important staff. We wrote many important things such as a tent the cooking equipments and enuogh food. In the next day we traveled to the mountaining area. When we arrived the first thing did it is how are we can bult the tent we took a few hours to bild it. Then we bought many tens food eggs and some rice. While I make the lunch I didn't found salt so I went to our nieghber and asked them could you give me some salt please but he gave me a great deal of the salt. After we had the lunch we went to a funland. Next we came back to our tent at this night the moon was shine brighty so we enjoyed in those night and spent all the night sang. We sleeped about in 3 after midnight. Etc
