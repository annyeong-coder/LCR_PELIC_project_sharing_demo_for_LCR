The assignment which is to describe my own personality is useful to think about myself. Therefore I decided to read my horoscope. For people who are born in May it says I am stubborn and who are born at the end of May are also hard hearted which is definitely true in my case. On the other hand side I am also strong willed which is an innate ability. My father whom I inherent this ability from is also a very strong willed person and highly motivated. My mother whose character is to be easily angered inherent me this character to be easily angered. A good thing is that I have the possibility to attract others which is to talk to other people easily. Therefore I really love to talk to other people who come from all over the world I have deep feelings for them and there life story. Sometimes I do the daydreaming which isn't good for me at all specially in classes. To do the daydreaming which is sometimes good to escape from a stressful day is a kind of bad habit of me. The last thing I want to mention is that I am restless. To describe restless in my case is to can not sit for 5 minutes in one an the same place. For example I was reading a book last sunday when I got interrupt from the phone facebook . . . . . . . . . .
