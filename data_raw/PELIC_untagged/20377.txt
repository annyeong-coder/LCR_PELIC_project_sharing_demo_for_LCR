One month ago I went to Atlanta with ELI teachers and friends. It's a first trip in the United States so I didn't know everything. I didn't know information about the America trip nevertheless I think that I need to the Camera. Frankly speaking I don't like to take any pictures but I want to remember the my first trip in the America. Anyway my choice was a good choice. Also I took some cloth enough money and luggage. Then I saw the CNN the Atlanta Aquarium and the Coke Meseum. . Etc. . Specially I'm surprised a lot of the Coke from the World.
