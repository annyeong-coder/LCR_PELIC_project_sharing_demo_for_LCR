I think that the comfortable environment make me more easily concentrated for my writing. So I prepare something before I start my studying. I believe that this is very important behavior for me. Let me introduce my own habits. The first of all I feel better when I drink hot tea. The drinking hot teas are also good for health. So I often drink some hot tea like green tea or any other hot teas. And then I clean my desk. The reason of this behavior is that my desk is usually too messy. Actually when my desk is too messy I can't look for something to need my studying. Also I turn the TV or the radio off. Because I cannot pay attention to study when it's too noisy. In addition I use some tools while I'm studying. For instance I usually use pencils and erasers to write something. Of course I use other equipments to write something like ballpoint pens but it's not usual. Because pencils are easier to fix wrong words or sentences more than other kind of pens. And I like a little bit cold temperature. That's why if my room is so warm I will be sleepy. Sometimes I turn all light on in my room. I believe that the area for studying needs enough bright. Because the darkness is not good my eyes.
