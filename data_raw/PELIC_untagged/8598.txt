One of the most important decisions that I made in my life was becoming a Nun. However making the decision was not easy. One of the crucial issues was that my boyfriend at that time proposed to me. If I had married him I would have never become a Nun. Maybe I would have been living in the same city where I was living at the time. If I had not been a Nun I would not have worked with very poor people. Poor people taught me about the meaning of sharing. Even thought this was a very happy time in my life I decided to quit. If I hadn't quit I would have been able to work in Africa. Sometimes I wish I could go to Africa. One year after leaving the convent I got married. If I hadn't quit the convent I would not have married Dio. I'm happy about my decision.
