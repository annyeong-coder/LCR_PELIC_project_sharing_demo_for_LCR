Downloading Music From The Internet Everybody likes to get free songs from the internet. Downloading music from the internet is a controversial topic that the downloader and the producer or the owner of the property argue about. However in order for a producer to continue in the business he must have his copyrights legally protected and people are forced to purchase original CDs. In my point of view it's crucial that the producer work within an environment that protects his intellectual property. Because any producer has operation costs and liabilities to meet such as wages production cost and distribution cost he must have a source of income that helps him to meet his obligations. Therefore protecting his property by law is critical for him to carry on in the business. Protecting the producer property by law is the only way to stimulate people to purchase the producer's products legally. For the sake of coercing people to buy the producer's products legally they must be banned from all illegal ways such as downloading from the internet and copying the original CDs. By blocking all illegal sources people will be forced to buy an original CD and obey copyright regulations. Many people like listening to their favorite singer free of charge. I understand that perspective but people should understand the producer's point of view by knowing that there is a company paying monthly expenses for their favorite singer such as deputation and wages. Thus people should support their singer indirectly by buying his songs legally to help his sponsor continue in the business and that helps their favorite singer to continue producing new albums. Downloading music from the internet should be forbidden and hence the producer should have his copyrights regulated and protected by law. Consequently the producer will find a suitable environment that helps him carry on in the business and the downloaders will be forced to buy original CDs.
