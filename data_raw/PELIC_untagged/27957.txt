As children we are absolutely responsible for taking care of our elderly parents. If you get older and thought about your kids it is very hard to let go of them so as your parents feel. Also this is the time for you to return the favor back to the people who rear you. Old people literally need someone to help them when they get so old and weak to take care of themselves. In addition age parents want to be surrounded by their family. Taking care of your elderly parents is the logical thing to do. Your parents took care of you when you where a little kid provide you the best education that they could and gave you their support when you needed it. In contrast you can give them back all what they did for you. Also I think you do not want your kids to abandon you in the future. Furthermore I strongly believe that old people dislike living alone in a nursery house without the people that they used to live with. Traditionally in my country Saudi Arabia adult children show respect and love to their age parents by taking care of them emotionally and financially. We also see that as a religious thing because we are surly that we will live happy and relieved life with our parents at least we can return little bit from their gratitude to us. Therefore we gather every week in our grandparent's house. Siblings in our culture are almost fighting with each others to keep their parents live in their house with them.
