Topic Do you believed that using technological devices is harmful and isolates us from social life The argument that using technological devices is harmful and isolates us from daily life is not entirely logically convincing since it ignores certain crucial assumptions. First the argument assumes the damage of using technological devices however it is not completely right for all cases. Some technological tools are designed in order to substitute a man in deleterious working condition such as radioactive environment or outer space. Second the argument never addresses the effectiveness of modern technology which helps people save time and energy in daily activities. For example if you have a common computer and the internet network at home you can go shopping online to purchase anything you need without taking a drive to different shops as well as making a long line in front of the cashier. Furthermore it is more beneficial for students to register the required programs through studying online without traveling to the university which supply their necessary courses. Finally the argument omits that due to technology tools make people closer. In particularly despite of geographical separation telephone or internet are useful devices to unit people together. Moreover perhaps never has there been more exciting time to travel all over the world by sitting at home with the highly technological equipment. Thus the argument is not completely sound. The evidence in support of the conclusion that technological devices will cause ineffectiveness and isolation does little to prove that conclusion because it doesn't address the assumptions which were raised above. Ultimately the argument might have been strengthened if the argument should have presented the effectiveness and beneficial of modern tools thus it can make an impartial conclusion of using the highly technological devices.
