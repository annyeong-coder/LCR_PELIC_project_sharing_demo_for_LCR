First of all you have to think about is in which way you want to talk with your friend. Begin with some of the decisions. You can choose more than one possibility to talk with him or her. If you are brave enough be the first who will call and offer him her to eat something. You can also go to the cinema together or you can just stay at some quiet place and talk about you.

You are now ready to start to speak about your last argument and about its reasons. If you think it was your fault try to start speaking. Say your friend how sorry you are.
