The city where I grew up was a big city. I remember many friends whom I played with. My best friend who I always played with in same group was the funniest boy between my friends. Our house which I think it was the biggest house in the neighborhood was located next where my grand father and mother were living. I remember the day when we moved to that house. It was in the summer. I wish that I can go back to that period of time which was a fantastic time.
