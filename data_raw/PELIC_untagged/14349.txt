I was born in Pochen which is rural and natural place. When I was young my father ran a farm in which there were many cows. My house which is surrounded by a hill is located in southern part of village. There were lots of kind trees flowers besides cows and dogs. One day my father gave me a little ginkgo tree and I planted it in my favorite place the gateway. The little tree we called Young A has grown into big tree in which we can get many ginkgo nuts until now. My mother used to give me the ginkgo nuts whenever I caught a cold. When I was 6 years old we moved to Uijeongbu my father's hometown. And I live in Pittsburgh now but I miss my hometown very much.
