Laws will not stop people to do what they want in this life. There are many laws that will come from different aspects. Some of these laws make at home which parents and siblings make them and others make from government to prevent many things. However some of theses laws will be disappeared in the future or become allowed to do during period of time. For instance when I was in a high school I always told myself that. When I'll graduate from high school I'll do anything that I like. My parents and siblings will stop to punish me you cannot do this and you can do this. I'll be free and I can eat and drink whatever I like. Also I can study abroad anywhere in the world. This dream always comes to my mind. No laws will stop me after I graduate from a high school because I feel I'm a mature person and I can be responsible for any fault or mistake that I do it in my life. On other hand people usually like some thinks that is not allowed to talk about it. Alcohol is a big issue that people always talk about it. Alcohol is made from some kinds of fruits or vegetables. There are many uses of alcohol which can use it in medical term to fix some kind of tissues. Also some people use it daily as drinking to reduce stress or they feel happy after drinking other people don't like it to drink. Drinking alcohol depends on country. Some countries prohibit it and others have different laws to drink alcohol. For example people who live in South Korea can drink at 18 ages however people who live in the U. S. Can drink at 21 ages. Recently there have been many small issues that keep everyone who live in the U. S. Talks about it. Why government allows drinking alcohol at 21 ages. To demonstrate this issue drinking alcohol is argumentative conversation between people who is ages under 21 years. Although some people think that should be lowered from current age of 21 to 18 I believe that we shouldn't reduce the ages and teach them the side effect of drinking alcohol.
