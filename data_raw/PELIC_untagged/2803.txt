The individual freedom maybe means a person who can use the language he likes the political power maybe means the government force people to use one specific language such as English. Therefore the ties which author mentions in the article means the conflict between these two parts. For example some countries they have many dialects in their country. However due to some reasons the government chooses English as their official language. This means all of the people in that country need to learn English and you need to use English in formal occasions. This indicates the political power is huger than the individual freedom. But it is not fair for people to use the language which they don't want to use at all. Thus the conflict between these two parts is very subtle but truly exists. These connections between the linguistic social and economics make the use of English seem to be a problem because it's impossible for everyone has the same opportunity to learn English even they are in the same society. For example the rich people have more opportunities than the poor people to learn English thus they will have more chances to get worldwide information and earn much more money. In the other hands the poor people have fewer opportunities to learn English well therefore it might be hard for them to get the chance to earn as much as money as the people who know English well. In addition to this there might have prejudices between the people who know English well and the people who don't know English. Those are not positive influences to a society or to a country. In summarily the use of English may cause some problems in different connections.
