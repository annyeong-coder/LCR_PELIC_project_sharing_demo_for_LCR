From past to now tourism has been one of the most stable way to earn money in my home country South Korea . But I think our government should invest in tourism much more. By enlarging tour industry my country can get some benefits. In global generation the name recognition of nation is very crucial point. Tourism is the invaluable method to gather natonal name recognition. Secondly we can be more cautious to manage the historical relics. Now we are reluctant to manage and clean the cultural assets. But if many foreigner comes to our country our whole nation will be interested in protecting cultural assets. Lastly By securing foreign currency we can prevent temporal bankruptcy. We went through the worst financial crisis in 1995
