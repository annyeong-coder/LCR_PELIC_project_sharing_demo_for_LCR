During the past 2 years economic crisis has emerged in the world. Most countries are inevitably suffered from the economic crisis especially financial crisis. However the crisis brought another opportunity to my country South Korea. South Korea already had experienced the similar financial crisis in 1997 which we call 'the IMF crisis'. In the IMF crisis South Korea learned about how to adapt to financial crisis. That is why South Korea acquired the better reputation from credit estimating companies and the companies which predict the future than other countries. Many foreign companies and the rich have invested South Korea. Many experts expected and announced that South Korea would be completely stable in next year and escape earlier from the financial crisis than other countries. If these comments come true South Korea would enhance its state in Asia and even more South Korea would lead the financial and economic market of Asia. However all these good situations are possible under the assumption that all South Koreans strive for it and probably they want it.
