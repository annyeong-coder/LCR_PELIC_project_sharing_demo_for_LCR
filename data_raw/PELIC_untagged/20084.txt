A time when you tipped too much or too little This is a experience I have had. Last time I had dinner with my friends after we saw a bill we tried to collect enough money to pay the bill. Actually we expected that the waiter should give me back our change and we can give her the tip in the other time. However she didn't pay attention to us she thought that we checked out the bill and she is busy of her working. That's a embarrassing time we lost little money. It was the good experience for us. Actually I didn't know tip culture before we always figured that a meal which is including the tip. I don't like this culture but I tried to adapt this.
