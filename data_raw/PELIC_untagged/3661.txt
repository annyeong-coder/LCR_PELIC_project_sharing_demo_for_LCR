I think the ideal education according to the authors is not to kill the children skills which are hidden on side of them if the instructor will push them to do something that they don't like and by that way they are killing there creative. For example over control and tell them exactly what and how to do things. Moreover to put the children in competition is wrong because if you do that you will put them desperate win lose situation where only one person win will be in the top and the other no you should allowed them to progress at their own rate. Furthermore the grades won't be the arbiter between the student and it should be open and let everyone shows what he strong in. They should let them show how their talent. The activity should be every week and to improve their ability of the thing that he is interesting in and like more than the others. The teacher and their student will be interact in this way of learning and teaching because the student will do what ever like to do and the instructors will be happy to help them and helping them to improve.
