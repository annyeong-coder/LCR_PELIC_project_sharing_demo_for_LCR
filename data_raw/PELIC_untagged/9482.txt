I am ANON_NAME_0 Last Name . If you have difficulty to pronounce ANON_NAME_0 you can call me ANON_NAME_1. I come from China. My first language is Chinese. I live in the Oakland Square with my husband. Every morning I go to school with my husband together. But he is always too lazy to wake up early. So he is sleeping while I am preparing the breakfast. Maybe you think it's unfair but I like to do this for my husband. I love him anyway. I am studying in ELI while my husband is working in Benedum at daytime. Then we back home at night together. I like many outside sports such as skating skiing ridding bicycle swimming etc. I like cooking also. But I hate clean the room.
