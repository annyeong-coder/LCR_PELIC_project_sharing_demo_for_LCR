My helper Sania was the best I'll never find such a good person like her. She helped me out in bringing my twines up. When we carried out our plan to travel to the U. S. A I cleared the difficult out for her to join us in this travel. This new let her down because she really loved my kids. However she figured out the matter and she decided to come back home. By the time of our travel to the U. S. A She had pointed out the reservation's date for her return home that well be before my son's exams. Therefore she told me that she would put the flight off until my son passed the exams. In addition she had put things away and covered them to keep them away of sand. She had helped me to pick out the kids winter clothes. In fact I found out that she had gone over everything from the refrigerator to the yard. I said for her I've been appreciating everything you had done for us for a whole five years. You really cheer us up .
