Instead of quitting suddenly I should have been more patient. When I quit suddenly my boss must have been embarrassed. It came as a big surprise to him so he must not have had bad intention to me. Also my colleagues had to have been surprised when they heard the news. Some of them called me from that day. Anyway with a different boss the atmosphere at work might have been very energetic. I regret my impromptu decision but I know that my boss and I could never have had a good relation with each other.
