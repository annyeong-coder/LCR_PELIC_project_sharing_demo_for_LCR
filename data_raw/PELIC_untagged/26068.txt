What Kinds of TV Programs I Like There are three kinds of TV programs I like. The first one sports program because I like watch the excite game. For example I see the world's cup when players scores the goal. I feel excite and I feel get energy. Second I like watch police show. I like the story feel excite and amazing. For example CSI MIAMI. It find out the case then use some science method look out the prove and find the killers. Third I like watch the travel progarm because it introduce many different culture food and place etc. For example the Travel channel often introduce different streets meal in different countries. In concusion althought other programs are funny and interest but my favorite programs are sports police show and travel.
