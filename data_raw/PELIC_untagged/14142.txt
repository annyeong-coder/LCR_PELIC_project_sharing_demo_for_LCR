The ELI is a good place to study English as a foreign language. I would like to point out 3 major reasons for that. First because students of the ELI came from more than 14 different countries all over the world each student has to use English to communicate each other. If most part of students came from single country students likely spoke their own mother language to communicate among the students. In this case English progress of the students would be inhibited since they loss their opportunity to speak English. I can make a friend from many countries and I can get an opportunity to speak English Milla said. Second the activities outside the campus offer the students much an opportunities to learn English. In fact there are many activities in the ELI and the activities are just on the increase. Finally the ELI has not only a single course like speaking but all of English learning course including speaking listening writing and grammar courses. This is an important point to note that Taking all these 5 courses would lead the students to fair and non biased English progress. Actually the largest group of the students 66. 67 Took all of 5 courses at a same semester. For these three reasons it is naturally led to a conclusion that the ELI is on of the best institutes to study English as a foreign language.
