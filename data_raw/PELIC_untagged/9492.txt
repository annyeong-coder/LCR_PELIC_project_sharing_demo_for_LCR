Dr. Sun Yat sen is the person who I admire. In Taiwan he is seen as the Father of the Republic of China and is called Father of the Nation after he died. It is believed that the Republic of China was founded by him. Sun's portrait was printed on the 100 bill in Taiwan because he is considered one of the greatest leaders of modern China. Furthermore the Three Principles of the People nationalism democracy and the people's welfare were advocated by him. For these reasons he is the most famous and important person I admire.
