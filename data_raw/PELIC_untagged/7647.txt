The Bermuda Triangle which is known as the Devil's Triangle is located in the northwestern of Atlantic Ocean. This place is very popular because there are many aircrafts and ships vanished without any clue. Some said it is brought about by the aliens. Others thought it is caused by the dynamic of the ocean current flows. Even though there are numerous theories about the Bermuda Triangle but nobody has tangible evidence or a proof of this phenomenon. In my opinion I think it might be caused of the magnetic field of that area. I read an article about the magnetic field of the Bermuda Triangle in a newspaper. It provided the information about why that area has the magnetic field and how those aircrafts and vessels are affected by this magnetic field. However it is just a possible theory which was not proved. Nowadays the Bermuda Triangle is still a mystery place which no pilot of any airline or no navigator of any ship wants to enter even if the Triangle was determined by the United States Coast Guard and Lloyd's of London to be no more dangerous than any other area of ocean.
