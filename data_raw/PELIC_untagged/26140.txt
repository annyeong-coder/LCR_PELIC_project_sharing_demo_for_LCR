First we have to take matches. We can use matches to start a fire for cooking. We also should take knifes which we can use to cut food or trees. In addition we might need chocolate. With chocolate we can gain energy when we can't find food. Except 3 items from the box we should bring sleeping bags. If we have them we may not be afraid of the cold weather. Also I may bring the Bible. It might make me calm down and I can read it to spend time too.
