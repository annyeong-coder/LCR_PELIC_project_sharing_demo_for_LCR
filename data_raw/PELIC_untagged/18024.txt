Yes I hope to be involved in the snow festival as an artist but I don't have experience. I think I hope to be involved in the snow festival as a volunteer to contribute with my time to assist who carves ice sculptures and statues but if the ice artists don't need to a volunteer or any assistance I hope to visit like this event to participate the people because this event is amazing.
