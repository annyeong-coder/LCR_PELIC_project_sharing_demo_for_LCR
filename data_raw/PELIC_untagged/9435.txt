My living room is a special place. My wife ordered it. First the sofa is under the window. The left wall is lined with the small dresser where we keep our special things. And I have small bookcase on the right wall where we keep my books. In the center we have a caffe table. Also in front of the sofa at the wall there is the tv on the small table. My wife always reorder the living room.
