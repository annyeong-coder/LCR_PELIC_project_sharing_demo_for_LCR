During I was working in Japan I had never run out of money. I worked even the weekend so I didn't have time to use my money. However after coming the U. S. I quitted my job so our income became less than half that was in Japan. Also we have a lot of time to enjoy ourself such as traveling shopping and eating so our expenses were big nowadays. We must take this problem more seriously.
