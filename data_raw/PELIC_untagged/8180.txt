Art and Science in Architecture Architecture is a vessel to contain human life by combination of art and science. First of all there are lie science in architecture. From antiquity through the present we have lived in a house because it is a necessity to our daily living in inclement weather. In nature humans had to endure a blizzard a heat wave and much moisture so they have had an influence the slope of a roof or the shape of a window and so on. With the passage of time the humans have required more scientific way to build bigger buildings. As a result today we consider a lot of things which are lighting ventilation humidity controlling and so on when we make to build. Furthermore architecture mirror political and social situation by art. For example ancient buildings like the pyramids of Egypt and the Roman Colosseum show us ideologies political beliefs and religions. By contrast current buildings like a school and a hospital exhibit the public and the community. In addition the humans basically have an aesthetic sense and they have desired to express their ideologies more beautiful. With the result that now we marvel at the beautiful of buildings by texture tone geometric as art when we see those. To sum up architecture makes our life of easy enjoyment and enrichment. People are still making a request that their building become more convenient and beautiful. Therefore I believe that architecture will be still worthy of important role in a future human life.
