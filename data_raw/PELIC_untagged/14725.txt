My mother was a great woman. I learned a lot from her. First of all She made me respect other people to they respect me. When I was child she had me work hard to achieve succeed in my study. Although she had me study hard she let me enjoy my hobbies in my free time. She helped me know my mistakes and correct them. Also she got me to try new things such as cooking she transferred her skills of cooking to me. Most importantly she made us cooperate with other to become strong family. Actually I admire my mother I hope I become mother the same as my mother to get my kids to do great things in their life.
