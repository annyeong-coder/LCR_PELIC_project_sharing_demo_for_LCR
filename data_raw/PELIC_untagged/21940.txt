English seen as Co Star should be attributed to two English speaking countries United Kingdom and the U. S. Because in the current centuries the U. S has been a country with supper power in polity economy and scientific technology after the power of United Kingdom which had been in those imperative positions for decades went down. During the period English as a dominant medium has been used for worldwide communication and business especially the nowadays economic globalization leads to the faster growing use of English. English as a national language makes any group people conveniently and directly communicate to other groups as well as makes cultural exchanges easier. However on the other side of coin English might be a cultural imperialism which can decline other minor languages by teaching English. Languages are a living thing that relate to polity economy and the population of a group who speak the same language. Some languages were extinct and some languages are in danger because the groups were disappear or are minor. Beside English there are some other languages widely used but English can't be dethroned due to its deep roots in the world.
