If I have a lot of money I would like to go to the Moon. Now a day going to the moon is not impossible dream. Human landed on the moon already about 30 years ago. Technology is developing speedy. Many countries made or are making space shuttles. Last year one Korean woman became an astronaut. She visited and studied at space station. She said earth is like blue ball and it's amazing and wonderful. She was able to feel the God's exist. I think the earth is the best beautiful planet. I want to see the earth in person.
