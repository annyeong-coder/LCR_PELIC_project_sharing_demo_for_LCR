Indent Cell phones and email make the communication between people faster and easier. Our grandparents had to wait around 15 20 days to receive news of their relatives outside the country now the advanced technology permit to do it in seconds through the cell phones and the email. For instance members of families who live in different cities or countries can communicate every day by cell phones or email and know about each other. Furthermore when workers of a company travel to other country for business they can communicate all the time with their bosses and coworkers by these tools making the business decision easier and quicker. Moreover students have the opportunity to send the homework to their teachers by email and be in touch with their friends by cell phone. However the technology is not perfect and sometimes cell phone and email don't work very well. For example emails occasionally don't arrive at time or if your computer has a problem you also cannot use your email. In addition cell phone signal is not enough in some places or sometimes they discharge in the middle of an important communication. Finally although cell phones and email are excellent and necessary tools in our lives sometimes they are not secure to use.
