For the past years that I have spent in the United States I've noticed several aspects of the American culture and how some things are different than what's one used to in his own country. For instance the US implements the English System for all measurements whereas all other countries in the world use the Global System. So if it is your first visit to US you must get adapted to the use of pound instead of kilograms and miles and foot instead kilometers and meters. However what's more noticeable are the sets of laws and regulations when it comes to age you must be at a certain age to able to get married or you can't gamble or even enter a place where there are gambling practices when you are under a certain age. Age restrictions propose several question but most importantly is how old is old enough to do a certain thing In the United States you have to be 21 or older in order for you to buy or have drinks of alcoholic natures. Most people believe that 21 is the appropriate age to be able to drink and any place which allows younger ages to have access to alcohol should be penalized. However because 21 is considered relatively high for most of the senior students in high school who are usually 17 to 18 years old they often resort to get fake IDs that prove they are 21 years or older. Thereby I believe that the legal age of drinking should be reduced to 18. Since most of who are at this age will try to obtain alcoholic drinks by any means it will be less severe if they don't commit a crime which is faking an ID in the process. In the following study several police report will be examined along with some selected court cases in order to support the claim that lowering the legal drinking age can help reducing or eliminating most of those cases.
