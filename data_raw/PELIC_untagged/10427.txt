My apartment is very cool and well furnished. Whenever I cooked something the smoke spread out in the apartment. There is an exhaust fan hang up above the cooking range. I was worried about that why this smoke spread out. I tried hard to found out and didn't give up. Finally I have found out that exhaust has come up with no connection outside. I turned off the exhaust and decided to buy an exhaust fan. Now whenever I cooked I hanged up the glass of the window and turned on the exhaust.
