What really shocked me is the weather here in Pittsburgh. I came to Pittsburgh in May 2011 coming from Saudi Arabia. My friends told to bring winter clothes but it was too hot in July and August that I thought it will never snow in this city. So what my friends said about the winter surprised me. These days it is too cold that I prefer staying in my apartment to avoid sickness. What is funny about that is I wore all my winter clothes I brought with me from Saudi Arabia and I am still freezing.
