Causes of Happiness Happiness is the state of being free of stress and any other life concern. Many factors affect people's happiness. Some people think that life changes make happiness a difficult dream. While others think that there are many reasons for happiness. From my perspective happiness can be achieved by acquiring the good health satisfaction and family relation. Initially a healthy body is a golden treasure which causes the permanent sense of happiness. Since people have many diseases they suffer from sadness more than pain. In contrast many healthy people feel happy as a result of the good health. Sick people cannot buy good health with money but they believe that health and satisfaction are the most expensive things in life. Secondly sleeping at night with a feeling of satisfaction will help people to be happy. No one can change his life or his fate so the people who want happiness should accept their life as is to be happy. In addition many things are happen accidently and without planning. Thus we have to give in to fate and think about the positive things in our life. Thirdly watching your children playing or your parents smiling will make you happy. Living a close life with your family is needed. As a result that will push you to change your way of thinking and seeing life. For instance sitting with the family at dinner or going out on a picnic should improve your ability to live and see their smiles forever. In a word there are many factors which affect happiness. Such as good health accepted fate and sense of family you have to acquire these factors to be happy. Finally we have to notice that there are many people are live in sickness discontent and loneliness while they can change their life for the better.
