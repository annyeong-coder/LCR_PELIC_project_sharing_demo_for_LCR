I believe that everybody has someone who can be called a friend. Although all of us have family I believe many of us rely on friends whose they can asking for advice giving inspiration and sharing or doing things together. For me there is a different between a 'friend' and a 'best friend'. A friend is someone that I know and meet somewhere. It can be someone from the same class from the workplace or anybody who I meet but not an acquaintance. I will call them a friend once I get to know their name phone number and something about themselves. They are not necessary someone who is close to me or will be by my side when I need them. However they probably someone who I will calls if I need company or going out for shopping. This is different with 'best friend'. Best friend can be counted. I just have few 'best friends' but I will probably have many 'friends'. Best friends are someone who I can always be trusted and rely on. They are the one who will be by my side during good and bad times. They are usually a person who is kinds understanding and stands by me when others won't. Besides that they are the person who will telling me the truth and giving me their thought even if it sometimes will hurt me. I believe that sincerity is the key to find a best friend.
