I believe in this message friendship is never end. While I was studying in high school I knew a lot of new friends. Ann who studied in the same class as me in grade 8 became my lovely friend. Although Ann and I had been studying together for 1 semester but we're very close. At that time I had some problem with mathematics the subject that I totally didn't understand. Ann became my tutor and she made me improve so much in that subject. Next semester Ann went to England to study. I felt very lonely because we were much closed and spent a lot of time together. We wrote to each other at least 3 times a week. When I got her letter which described her life in England I was very happy. Though we don't write to each other like in the first year she left but she still be my best friend who I want to talk with whenever I happy or sad.
