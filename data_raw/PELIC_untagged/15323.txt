Pittsburgh weather is similar to my country. It has four season. When I came to US it was summer. The summer is very hot and long. Especially sunlight was very strong so many people have to wear a sunglass and a hat. I also bought them because I hated the strong sunlight. However the pittsburgh fall is the beautiful season. Many trees have changed a lot of color yellow red purple. . Etc. So we could see the various colors leaves and Someone could collect several leaves from fall on tree around. But the pittsburgh fall is very short so I've missed that. There is a winter very cold and long. My country winter is same here. Though my country didn't have a lot of snow colder than here. But I lived here and I loved the pittsburgh.
