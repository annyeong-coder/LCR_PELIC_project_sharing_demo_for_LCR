THE BEST TEATCHER IN MY LIFE The best teacher in my life was my father. He taught me many things. He helped me to be a straight man and he did every thing for me When I was a child he got me to be active. For example if I wanted to speech with others he let me speech freely and he had me share with volunteering group. I remember my father was working very hard to take care of us and to gave us the suitable and secure life. Also he was worry about my feeling. For instance he was asking me if I need any thing or if I want any thing. When I admitted to the university he was very hobby and he made me chose the suitable major. My father was dealing with me as a friend. I love my father and I am very proud of my father.
