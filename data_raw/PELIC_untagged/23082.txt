Before to moved to Pittsburgh we had been thinking about to pick out a house for leaving. However after we were looking over different places we ended up leaving in an apartment. We found out that is cheaper than a house. After we signed the lease up we picked up some furniture and we tried to set up each room. We chose this apartment because is big and bright you don't need to turn the light on during the day that cheer me up. However we had to pick up a very dark curtains for the bedroom to block the light out especially in summer time when the sun come up very early. This apartment turned up cozy and comfortable for us once in a while we move the furniture around or we take some decorations away to make it up a different place. I enjoy to lie down on the couch and watch a movie or read a book especially in winter time. It is my favorite spot.
