I love both my sister and my mother. They have several similar things. First both my mother and my sister are blood type A. My mother has black hair and so does my sister. Another similarity is that their voices are very similar so usually people confuse who is my mother or my sister. In addition both of them speak Korean. The last similarity is both my mother and my sister married.
