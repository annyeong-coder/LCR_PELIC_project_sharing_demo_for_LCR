My favorite lunch place is Panela Breads in Oakland. I'll explain why I like this place. First of all I like bagels. I have had bagels in a lot of cafe but the bagels are most delicious in my life. Especially cheese bagel is fine. Second they have Wi Fi system which is really useful for me. Because of that I usually don't need it but I use the laptop during lunch when I plan to our trip with my friends. Third they have a free coffee if you order a cup of coffee. Sometimes I study and do homework there alone or with my friends after lunch. I need some drink. Especially I feel sleepy after lunch then caffeine get me to wake up everytime. The most importance reason is shop assistants are really kind. I'm studying English now so I usally have mistakes about pronunciation and I sometimes can't understand their talk. But almost shop assistants try to understand my English. Talking to them is a good practice for me. Because of these I like Panela Breads. Panela Breads which gets me to satisfy my stomach which I can practice English. It's my favorite place for lunch.
