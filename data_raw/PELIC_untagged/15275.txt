My sister is a really creative person. She is able to draw a perfect picture in few seconds. She can draw in an old fashion way with a pencil as well as she can draw on the computer. When she painted a picture which she didn't like then she painted it as often as possible. She can not be satisfied which imperfect picture. This picture are only in her opinion imperfect. Also she is able to arrange things in a beautiful way. For instance to arrange furniture or decorations. My sister loves to be creative and forget all around her when she is lost in her thoughts.
