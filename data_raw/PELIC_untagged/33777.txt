Through our life we make many friends but who is the one who we can refer to as a real friend. From my perspective a friend is someone who I can trust and who trusts me in return. Moreover a friend is someone who is always looking after me and will help me if I am in trouble. My best friend name is Layla. Layla who is now my sister in law was my neighbor. Her father who was my father's friend made an agreement with my father to rent a bus to Syria with our families when I was 12 years old. After that I became a close friend with her. We attended the same elementary intermediate and high schools but unfortunately we had never been in the same class. Although we were in different classes we kept on meeting each other in the break. In summer break my other friends whose friendship was built on benefits did not trouble their self to ask about how I was doing but Layla was always keeping in touch with me until this time. After that I had realized whom I should call a real friend. We attended and graduated from the same university. After she became my sister in law my friendship with her became stronger. Before I came to USA she had helped me straighten up my apartment. Since I am the only daughter in my family which consists of five sons I consider Layla as my sister not only a friend because when I look at her I see myself with the same behavior and opinion.
