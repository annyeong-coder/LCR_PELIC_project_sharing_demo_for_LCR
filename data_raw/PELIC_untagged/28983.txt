Dear SAND Don't be sad There must be a solution for any problem. But you ought to have told your boyfriend about your feeling before he moved maybe everything could be different And you shouldn't have called him just one time try to keep in touch with him. Now you had better visit him first to be sure that you both want to continue this relationship you can ask him it will be ok . If he loves you he shouldn't let you go. You ought to stay calm Everything going to be fine. Chatty. .
