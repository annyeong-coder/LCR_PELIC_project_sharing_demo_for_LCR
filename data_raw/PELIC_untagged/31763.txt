One day I went to get some food by my self. I could have eaten with my friends. After I arrived to the store I went to the store. Actually I shouldn't have gone by my self alone that night. After a while o came bavk to my car and the window was broken. I was shocked. I shouldn't have left the gps on the seat. I should have left it in the trunk. So it was stolen I got mad but I shouldn't have driven by my self that late time.
