I was born in Tripoli where I used to live. I grown up among a big family so I used to be in a cooperating and rallied invironment since that I did not use to be a just member in all programs that I participated in. During my primary and secondary school I was very active student and at the same time I did not use to think about the consequences and results of doing a lot of activities Noting could prevent me from doing what I wanted to do. In few words I used to be busy with my unlimited hobbies. Now a days I'm different person who uses to think towice before go forward to the next step I did not use to have as many responsibilities as I do now this maight be one reson for such changes but offcourse not every thing now I am older than I was fifteen years ago and this will limit my activities and participations last week I went to play soccer with my friends and I noted that I can not run five kilometers while I used to run more than six kilometers each game. On the other hand today I can do so many issues that I could not do in the past for example I did not use to travel a lot but now I do as I am here in America.
