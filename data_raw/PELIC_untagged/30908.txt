I found a large room around up to the Broadway in the large old building. The room I had seemed to be given up to dust and cobwebs. I felt like seeing the ghost in the room. When I woke up the bed I heard on the something like the elephant was walking around the room. I just thought and said that it is just a horrible nightmare but I found the big footprint. After finding the footprint I kept thrilling on the strange sound and felt horrible. When I heard the strange sound to stop in front of my door I found the ghost like the majestic Cardiff Giant. At this time my unhappiness was disappeared because I know his friendly face show me that he can't hurt anyone. I was asking about his appearance and story around thirty minutes and then I asked you were tired. He said yes and he told me that where he is from because I have treated him so well. He was the spirit of the Petrified Man that lies across the street there in the museum and If my poor body can not bury I can have no rest and no peace. So I tell the truth to the ghost that you walked around your plaster cast. After the ghost listened on this he said like he felt bed when he heard this body is not real and disappeared. I felt sorry when he was gone and he had carried off my red blanket and bathtub.
