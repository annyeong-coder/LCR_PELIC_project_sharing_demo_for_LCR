Dear ANON_NAME_0 Laptops are widely spread nowadays. Most people use laptops almost every where and for every thing. They are used in houses companies schools and many other places. The main reason for this that the laptops have many special characteristics which can't be found in the normal computers. In this essay I'm going to discuss some of these characteristics for instance weight screen memory and battery life between two laptops they are IBM and Dell. The first characteristic is the weight. The weight is very important thing in laptops. The laptops are taken to every where for this reason everyone who wants to buy laptop should take in his her account that the weight is a significant thing. If we compare IBM laptop with Dell we will analyze that the first one is heavier than the second one. Secondly is the screen. As we all know that sitting for a long time in front of the laptop screen may affect our eyes. For this reason choosing wide screen is important. Dell screen is wide comparing to IBM screen. And it is also shows the graphs more clearly than IBM screen. Thirdly is the memory. Every one has his her own documents. Some people are facing problems in saving these documents in their old computers. But laptops are offering the place for saving these documents but there is a difference between IBM and Dell. IBM has bigger storage than Dell. The last thing is the battery life. In some places we can't find electricity to charge our laptops. So the new laptops have a battery life for a long times. IBM has longer battery life than Dell. To recap each laptop has it own characteristics. Every one of us should choose the most suitable one for him her. Personally I prefer Dell than any other laptop. Thanks
