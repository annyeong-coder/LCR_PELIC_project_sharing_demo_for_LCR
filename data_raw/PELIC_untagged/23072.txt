I used to live in China. I studied in Beijing. In those days I used to go to class several days I used to play computer games with roommate at free time everyday. I used to eat in student dining hall. I used to play basketball after class. And I used to sleep later in evening. In weekend I used to hang out with my friends. Today I am live in Pittsburgh and studying English in ELI. I surf the Internet by my computer. Sometimes I can cooking in my home. I do my homework after class. I sleep early at night. At the free time I enjoying the party.
