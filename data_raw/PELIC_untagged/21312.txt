I think there is a need for a group like PETA because animals need to be protected. First each animal has its biological significance of the existence they are in the natural law of survival. Second we need animals and once they are gone there will never be any more. Third the protection of animals is to protect human beings themselves! Therefore there are necessary for more groups like PETA to protect animals.
