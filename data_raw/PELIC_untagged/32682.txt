The heart has its reasons of which reason knows nothing Blaise Pascal 1623 1662 I think this phrase means that what you ressents with your heart is not always explainable. And we can not necessarily find a logical cause by our reason. For me It's simple when you love you become unreasonable. A person who love is unable to analyze things calmly. It may happen that we are in situations in which we do things out of Love same things that we would never do after careful reflection. We human being does not think with our heads but with our hearts.
