Two weeks ago I went to The Mall at Robinson with my friends. This my first time went to shopping in Pittsburgh. When we were standing the entrance door looking into the hall first we saw some kinds of dresses put in the wardrobe. We were very excited that my first step starting. Then pass through the hall we smelled the thick coffee odor it seemed filled the shopping mall. We left for coffee shop immediately. After that we went to several sores and chose a little clothing that we felt comfortable and suitable for the winter weather. We were so hunger and tired until we stopped. We ate a lot of food in the restaurant. The experience impressed me most favorable on vocation if we have a free time will go there again.
