When I was in Turkey I decided after I graduated from my university where I studied civil engineering. I explored some language schools especially which are in the U. S. A and finally I found out University of Pittsburgh Language school. This school has a lots of reputation of learning English that s why I have chosen it. After I started learning English in this institute I took many different courses from many different teachers. Anyone has a different teaching style different characteristic from another one. According to my experiences and observation teaching style is crucial part of learning English in order to enhance your English skills and adapt to institute. First reason that teaching style is crucial part of learning English is for enhancing your English skills. I am taking five different classes which are listening speaking grammar writing and reading at the ELI from different teachers. Before I came here my all English skills were the same level I know all of them have improved and I believe that they keep improving but now they are not all the same level some of them are higher than others. Do you know why The answer is so simple teaching style. For example the beginning of the course I was so biased towards writing I had never thought that I could manage to write very well but because of my writing teachers approach or teaching style was perfect for me. He always encouraged me he got to trust myself. In addition whenever I made a mistake he corrected me by giving an example and challenging. For this reason I think I can write writing very well at least before I came here. On the other hand my reading teacher s teaching style is totally different my writing teacher. She prefer giving lots of homework and she wants us to find our mistakes by ourselves. This style does not work for me. If I found my mistakes I was not be here. As a result of this I was able to be good at writing but I was not able to good at reading because of writin style.
