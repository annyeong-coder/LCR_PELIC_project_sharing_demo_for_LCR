The town where I grew up was a small city near Seoul. After school I usually went to the small mountain which is near my house. I used to catch dragonflies with my friends who I got along well with in the mountain where I spent much of time. Sometimes I went there with my relatives whose parents visited my house. In that mountain there were many people who wanted to feel the nature. There are many good memories about the mountain that I still remember.
