Nowadays most scientists and engineers in the world are men. Many people said that's because of societal pressures which make women stay away from Science but in my opinion women stay away from science is because they don't want to study science or they don't like it. It is inevitable that some women don't like to study science. If there are many women want to study science and interested in it I believe that they can study it well and there would be many women scientists and engineers in the world. Although many science subjects requiring many imagination are very difficult subjects for women. In my opinion if they really like these subjects they can maximize their knowledge by studying hard. That's why I think that women don't study sciences is just because they don't like it not because of societal pressures.
