First of all I would like to give an overview over my history of education and how they affected on my decision to choose my field. When I graduated from high school I joined one of Saudi's Universites. Having a great interest in English Language made me apt for this field. In fact I took some short English courses before the actual enrollment. After that I joined English Department as a full time student. Since the department has a particular policy to enroll to the department they form a placement test which is held to measure the student's background of English. Passing this test does not guarantee you to enroll the department. However students should attend an intensive course for one semester and then they can access the department as an English department student. For me I passed all these tests successfully. I made a great a compitetion between my classmates until I graduated with high rate G. P. A. Four years with experience in teaching English Language in Saudi schools has granted me a spectacular expertise. Later on I was chosen by the English department as TA. The department was lack of some specialization in some fields particularly Linguistics. Since that time I was not interested in it as I interested in TESL. As it is an ambiguous area I started to read abut it I realized it that is a sensible field and helpful too. My major has many attributes that may help to learn more about human languages. My major which includes phonetics syntax phonology and morphology is consider one of the pillars that may contribute to understand most of the globe's languages and their rules. Finally I would acknowledge my teachers in ELI because they do their best and great efforts to help us.
