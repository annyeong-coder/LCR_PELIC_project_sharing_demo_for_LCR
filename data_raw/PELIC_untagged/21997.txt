Before you taking a trip to an island alone you should tell someone where you will be and what your plans are even if you decide to change them at the moment. For example in The Survival At Sea story Cathy Maready changed her plan and no one knew about it. She was tired and wanted to save time so she decided to flight instead of driving. Then the engine of her plane stopped and the cabin filling with water and fuel where she suffered from shock and sever hypothermia and spent three days in the hospital without anyone knows what happed to her. You should tell someone if you are going into an island by yourself and make sure to take enough provisions first aid kit contains every necessary things appropriate clothing cell phone and make sure the cell phone is charged and save the emergency contact numbers in case if you exposure to emergency situation. For instance in The Only Way out story Aron Ralston wanted to ride his bike and climb the rocks and his arm trapped by a rock for five days. He didn't have enough food and water he wore only T shirt and he did not have a jacket when he needed to wear it and he had just a small first aid kit. The problem was that he had not told anyone about his plans and he made his friends and his family worried about him as he needed to medical attention because he cut his arm off in order to survive. In case if you want to go with group and you become a leader you have to be strong put your men first be able to save your crew from disaster and encourage them to never give up and be able to think clearly in the face of danger. For example in The True Story Of Shackleton's Endurance Expedition story Shackleton was leader of the Endurance Expedition group. Their ship became trapped in the ice as it approached Antarctica and it broke apart from the pressure of ice and sank but he was a good and strong leadership because he kept up the crew's spirits put the crew first he never gave up and saved his group and no men died. Enjoy your trip
