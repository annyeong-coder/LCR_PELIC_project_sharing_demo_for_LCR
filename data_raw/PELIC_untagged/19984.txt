There are advantages and disadvantage of learning how to cook own meals. The first advantage is eating healthy foods. The other advantage is saving money when learn how to cook. The last advantage is eating different foods in your home. The disadvantage in my opinion is when you cook and approach to the oven. You required changing your clothes because the cooking smells on your clothes.
