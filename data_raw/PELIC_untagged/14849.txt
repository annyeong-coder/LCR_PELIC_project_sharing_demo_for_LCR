Foreign movies Foreign movies are not exactly the perfect way to learn about a different country or culture. They are likely to capture the stereotype in each country or culture and focus on that picture just to attract audience as much as they can. For example when a movie is about Arabic culture they either make people look like as if they just came out of a history book wearing old clothes and riding camels or make them terrarists planning to destroy the world. People can not get a clear Idea about a country from what they see on movies because it is only reflecting the movie director's point of view and not the real thing. In general we can not take what we see on movies for guarantee because it only describe the director's opinion and it only care about the audience number. Sometimes the facts will be true but must of the time they are not.
