At the beginning I was born in 1980. Then while I was in high school I was living with my parents. After that when I graduated from high school I left my hometown to the capital city in Saudi Arabia. Next I applied to king ANON_NAME_0 University. When I got my admission I rented an apartment. While I was living in Riyadh my father bought me a car. In 2000 I graduated from college of Computer. In 2009 while I was working at National Information Center I got my scholarship to study in USA. In fact these events are considered the major events in my life.
