October 16 2006 Dear father and mother We moved to pitt for 10 months. Right now I live in here more comfortable than at the beginning of time I like here the more enioy shoping the more. Sometimes buying clothes in here are cherper than buying clothes in China however most clothes are made in China. I don't know this is why In here you can use different coupons. Using coupons are a good way for saving money. On holidays many malls always have bigger clearance sale than ordinarily especially thanksgiving. Sometimes rebate is 75 a cloth only spend about 2 I think this is an unbelieve thing but it is true. If you can visit I'm very happy. I hope you can visit. Love
