Topic How have cell phones ipods and the Internet changed the way people enjoy music The plenty of music are available everywhere even under the water. Developing technology lets us stick to music through ipots cell phones and the Internet. We used to have several steps to get music. First we must go to the stores and select CDs. After we get to house we listen to them through CD players. But now we can contact the music easely by using the Internet. We can listen to samples of worldwide music and download them to ipots and cell phones for free or less prices. We have benefit from this system. However it has some issues in Japan. For example we haven't had an appropriate law to manage an authority of music on the Internet. Providers update the latest music on it nearly no charge and users download them as much as they want. The providers get rewards from this process instead of composers. Many composers have become victims of this system. They have dedicated to contribute inspirational music for listeners but their rewards go through them for the providers. Therefore they offered the government to renovate a law that protects their authorities and budgets. I think that this problem is not only Japan's. The Internet distributes music all over the world. Perhaps the worldwide composers need a new commitment about the authority of music.
