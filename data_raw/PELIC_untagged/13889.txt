One time I remember that I woke up in the morning and I picked up my car keys to go to a barber shop. When I was on the chair my mobile phone rang. I looked at the screen to find out who is the caller. It was a strange number so I didn't answer but I saved the number to call him her back again. But the caller kept on calling over and over so I had to pick the phone up. It was a telemarketer who was trying to talk me into getting a credit card offer. He came up with some offers that I really liked but at that time I had to turn the offers down because I had just resigned. The telemarketer didn't give up offering me some advantages. So I had to promise him that I will think over some of his offers. Finally I was able to hang up.
