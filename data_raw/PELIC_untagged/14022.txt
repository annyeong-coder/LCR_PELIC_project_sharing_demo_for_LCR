Dear Member I know that some of you are discouraged because it is taking you so long to run five miles. But don't give up yet. Generally it takes 45mintes a typical runner to run five miles at the end of the first year. It takes 34minuts at the end of the second year. You will run fast decrease time when you run during the following six years. In addition if you take during seventh year it will take 31minutes to run five miles. I am wishing you to keep running. Let's hold out together.
