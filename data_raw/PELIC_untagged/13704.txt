ANON_NAME_0 is looking forward to start his academic program. He has a clear future plan. ANON_NAME_0 will not stay in the USA after finishing his study. He is going to go back home to work in AL FATAH university with a good teaching position they have already offered him. After he gets the required TOEFL result he will move from Pennsylvania. And according to him he will not forget us because he is going to visit Pittsburgh and his friends when he has a chance to do so. In our grammar class last Friday ANON_NAME_0 said he is eagerly waiting for his first baby. He is going to be so happy when he sees his heir. During the last few days the near future father told all ELI teachers and students his story about his expectation date to have his son or daughter. If the baby is boy ANON_NAME_0 is going to name him Saif Alah. And he will think about her name if the baby is girl. I think ANON_NAME_0 will not forget this city because his baby's certificate of birth will remember him about Pittsburgh and his stories at ELI.
