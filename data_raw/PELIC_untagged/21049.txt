Istanbul where I was a student at university is the most crowded city in Turkey. I have ever forgotten the first day when I came there as a student. Because I was a fresh man and also Istanbul where 15 million people live made me feel depressed. First I stayed in a dormitory. The dormitory where three thousand students stayed is so far to my university but this was never a problem for me because I like Istanbul and I like my dormitory. The dormitory where there were three big canteen three basketball field four internet cafe is the most biggest dormitory in Istanbul. Most students got together with their friends in the canteen where they could play billiard or table tenis or pinball. At this dormitory I stayed for one year I met many people. I remember the day when I met Adnan who would be my roommate.
