Look before you leap I think this moral means if you want to do. Something you have to prepare and learn. When I was 21years old I had a soccer match with girls. I thought game will be easy. However their physical strength and team work was amazing. Finally we lost the soccer match. At that time I heard about amazing girls team. They were champion of female soccer team. I should did my best even though they were girls.
