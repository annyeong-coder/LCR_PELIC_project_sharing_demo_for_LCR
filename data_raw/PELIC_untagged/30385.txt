I think that graffiti is a form of art because it can attract diverse spectators. It is creative and original. I think if street artists carefully select where they draw a graffiti it will be popular and recognize as a form of art. Of course it is necessary to do legally. In order to do this someone have to provide them with places and opportunities to draw graffiti.
