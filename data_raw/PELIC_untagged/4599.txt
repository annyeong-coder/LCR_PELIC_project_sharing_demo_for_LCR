When I was child one of my classmates became very close to me. His name was ANON_NAME_0 and he was very pensive. I was advised by him. He was judicious. I was taught by him how to be pensive like him. Also I was treated very nicely by him. When he was trying to advise me he was using a nicest way to deliver the tip to me. I am very influenced by ANON_NAME_0 notably by his approach to preach or advise other people. It had been said that if you like person you will be influenced by him.
