This term is my second term in the ELI. I acknowledge that an improvement can be noticed in my English. That is because of my teachers they have helped me a lot to achieve what my English is now. They have fostered my vocabulary by teaching us new words each week through the term and instill these us these words by using them in the classes. The other thing that helped me is that I have subscribed in a couple of learning English websites. Now I feel consolation with my English. For foreseeable future I think I will remit my papers to an architecture school in Pittsburgh after passing the TOEFL test. Thanks for my teacher who have been supportive.
