Although I have some kind of personality I am rather a person who is an introvert. Because I am shy and I don't like to speak in public. Sometimes I am requested to speak more loudly in a class which is ELI because my voice is small. My dimensions which are modest and patient seems inheritance from my mother who served her mother in law for a long time. In fact I lived with my mother in law who was suffered from diabetes and I controlled her diet for 13 years without having any complain. However some friends say that I am a person who is an extrovert because I always live positively and I am continuing to study something. I think everyone has different personality which both are opposite.
