Style is different between countries. For example style in eating living working and decorating your home. Last week I looked at the Syria Lebanon room. Also we looked at the early American room. Their were so different in everything that you can't find any similarity between them. However each room has showed their people style of living eating decorating and social life. The Syrian and Lebanese room shows one of the oldest styles of decorating in the world. It was the living room. I liked it because of the decoration. It was colorful and the lights were amazing. It was big enough for 10 people or more to sit in the room. That means the people who lived in that time were social. The decoration was wonderful. It keeps you just looking in the wall and I think that means their were rich. It also has some religious decoration that is painted on the wall. The old American room was interesting and it shows many things about old American history. It was a whole house. The colors are only brown and white. They have the kitchen with the living and dining room in the same place. Also they have the bedroom on the second floor with a secret room to hide in if the Indians try to attack them. The secret room means that they lived an uncomfortable life because of the war with the Indians. Both of the rooms were enjoyable but I liked the Syrian room more than the early American room. Because the Syrian room was more colorful but that does not mean the early American room was not interesting. It was wonderful but I think if there was no war that time it could have been better.
