I faced a great dilemma while I was studying in university. I thought that I should have solved the problem properly but I didn't. James who was my best friend was falling in love with Lopez who was also my friend. One day James asked me for advices to solve the trouble that they usually had different opinion about something and they sometimes even quarreled about it. I just told him not to think too much because I thought the situation was very common in lovers. Furthermore I worried about that things might be going worse if I had messed in it. Unfortunately they separated several weeks later and they both were very sad. I thought that I was inconsiderate for my friends and I should have done my best to find out what the main problem was and helped them to solve it. I also could have tried to console both of them. However I considered that they might have given more patience with each other because love was never perfect. I was very regretful about that thing because it should properly have been solved. From now on I shouldn't let things like this happen again to anyone of my friends.
