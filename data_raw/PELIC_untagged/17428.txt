I think there is a close correlation between learning and creativity although learning is not always creative. In my art classes I was forced to spend hours after hours just drawing straight lines. It's not very inspiring besides it hurts your shoulder very much. However when you are ready to express your artistic creativity I believe all the practice makes it perfect.
