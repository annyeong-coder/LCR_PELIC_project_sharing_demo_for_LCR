I have been visited many cities in my country but I have two interested cities in my mind The first is Chai Mai city and The second is Phuket city. Two city have many interesting plase. For example Chai Mai city has the most beautiful mountains and most wonderful waterfalls but Phuket city has the most beautiful beaches. In winter Chaimai is the coldest city in my country. However Phuket city is not the hottest city in my country. If you worry about hotel I think. You don't worry about it because Chai Mai and Phuket have the biggest cleanest and best hotels. When you stay in Phuket and you are angry I recommend sedfood to you because Phuket has the freshest seafood in my country and it is not expensive. However Chai Mai has The most kind of vegetables and freshest vegetables in my country. All in All I Think two cities have as same as something but something different. However Two cities are very good for me.
