After graduating from high school if I studied management information system I would have met a lot of my school friends most of whom studied this major. Then I might have fun and never study every day I go to college. Had I have fun every day I would get bad grades and drop school. Dropping school I might stay at home cleaning and cooking every day. On the other hand I chose to study nursing. If I hadn't work for two years I wouldn't have pursed for a higher degree. Had I not thought about completing my study I wouldn't have been in Pittsburgh. Then I might stay at my home country and never got the chance to meet ANON_NAME_0.
