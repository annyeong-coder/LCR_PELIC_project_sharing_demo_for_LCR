I. Intro Although people say death penalty should exist I think it is time to abolish it because there are no evidence to prove death penalty is beneficial to our society. II. A. People say death penalty threaten criminals efficiently. Report indicates there is no connection between death penalty and criminal rate. Some say it makes society safe. Actually thievery arson or assault is the main reason that people feel unsafe not manslaughter which can be sentenced to death. B. Some say jail costs too much and also criminals deserve death penalty. However human have the right to live and everyone has second chance usually juvenile criminals. C. If someone is put to death there must be enough evidence and reasons. According to history there are many examples that innocent people were killed by wrongful execution. III. I am not talking all criminals are innocent. Actually what they do is so terrible and has extreme influence on people and society. However There are many innocent people were executed because they were wrongfully judged. Also death penalty does not play the important role on reducing criminal rate and threatening criminals or protecting people. Furthermore we do not have right to execute people who also have right to live. Therefore I agree to abolish death penalty instead of other better punishment. 1.
