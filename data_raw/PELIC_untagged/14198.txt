After I read all quotations on page 203 that are choices for writing homework I picked one good quote that I thought it could be the best one that covers all definitions of best friend. So A friend in need is a friend indeed. Is the one that just rights to my heart because it reminds me of someone who really cares about me. Besides he never lets me down. He's the only one who is always show up in front of me when I need someone to listen to me and understands me the best. Moreover I often went to his condo which is on the Cha am beach and spent vacations over there with no worried about the bills because he is the one whose mother is the owner of many restaurants around the Cha am beach. Even though we are separated because I decided to come to the US we never felt apart from each other. Even though I often missed his calls he kept calling me and sent me whatever I asked for. In conclusion the best friend is someone who always gives good things to you. The only one that you thinking of when you have problem and you know that you can always count on him. The one who's always encourage and inspire you. And the one who shares all properties with you the best friend whose parents love you as much as their son. He is my friend indeed.
