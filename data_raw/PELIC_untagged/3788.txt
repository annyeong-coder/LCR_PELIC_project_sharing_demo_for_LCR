Veganism Veganism an extension of the vegetarian diet is considered an integral component of a cruelty free lifestyle Vegan Action 2007 . The diet consists on getting the protein from fruits beans grains and vegetables and staying completely away from meat fish poultry eggs and dairy products. Although many health benefits have been discovered in the recent years costs and accessibility makes this diet difficult to adhere. Recently many studies support that the consumption of animal fat and proteins are the main cause for many lethal diseases such as cancer diabetes heart attacks and obesity. Therefore some people choose to follow the vegan diet for health reasons. It seems almost impossible that all the fat and proteins found in animal products could be also found in plants and other sources but it's not. For instance fat can be obtained from oil products and legumes and grains provide with a planned diet the same protein amount plus other vitamins and minerals. The vegan diet has shown to be healthier and as a result a person's life expectancy could be prolonged. However although it looks like the top choice diet it's not simple to stick with it. Fast food meat dairy and eggs costs are notably cheaper than fruits and vegetables. For instance organic oranges are sold for around 1. 5 Per lb. When a pound of a whole chicken costs 0. 70. And what's more it's very difficult to find a vegan restaurant or a vegan supermarket in nowadays a fast food culture. A vegan life is expensive and requires access to a nearby market which is becoming extinct in many U. S. Cities. The vegan diet is the result of the search to find a pure diet whose goal is to avoid the violation of the animal rights and the most frequent diseases caused because a poor nutrition. Veganism offers a healthy life style but demands a strength of will from the person following the diet because it's a diet which many just can't afford following.
