I'd like to say about improving of air this time. The reason I think fresh air is important is that air is the most basic element in the world for human being to live even though it is invisible and the importance of air is easily ignored. When I thought air is threatened by us was when horrible yellow wind was flowed into Korea from China. I couldn't see anything but dark yellow fog even though it was daytime. I also couldn't breath easily. It seemed like I was likely suffocated by the wind. The air on earth is not found yet other planets in the space and we have to preserve it before it is polluted and cannot be recovered. Then how can we preserve air quality Many possible solutions are already existed but most of them are hard to be done because of industrial development and other complicate issues. For example reducing CO2 is one of the major methods to prevent air pollution but any country doesn't want to be the first because it can cause raise the cost of producing products and consequently reduce the price competence. In addition this CO2 problem can be achieved by a few countries' participation. Air is shared by all people and everyone should help air cleaned together. However we cannot wait for the participation forever. There are surely something we can do as a member of earth. For instance we can reduce pollution by using public transportation and buying a car which emits pollution less rather than buying a faddy car. These efforts can affect much when they are accumulated.
