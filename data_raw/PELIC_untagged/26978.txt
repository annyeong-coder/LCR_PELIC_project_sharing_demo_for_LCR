My hometown Taitung is a small county in Taiwan. When I was successful at apply to a university in Taipei I was filled with anticipation. Taipei is the biggest city in Taiwan where the people have access to the best and the most complete resources. People living in Taipei have convenient transportation the best education and medical environment compared to Taitung. Despite living in Taipei is very convenient I still like my hometown. Taitung was called the last undeveloped paradise in Taiwan. People living in Taitung have cleaning air and environment without pollution and crowded. Both Taitung and Taipei are my favorite cities because people are enthusiastic. People are willing to help and warm other people. All things considered living in a small town and living in a big city both are great choice depend on personal situation and value.
