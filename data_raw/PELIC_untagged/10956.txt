Have you ever told a lie You might have the experience to tell a lie because of reluctances. However telling the truth is the most important consideration in any relationships. I think people should not tell lies because not only telling lies will break our credit but we will make up more lies to complete our lies. First it will break your credit if someone finds that you tell a lie. They will not believe you because you do not tell the truth. Also it is hard to establish your credit. For example one of my previous colleagues performed well at my company so my supervisor believed her so much. On time she pretend she was sick because of her laziness. She asked for a sick leave and she went to movies in a mall. Unfortunately our supervisor made an appointment with a customer at a restaurant in the mall. They ran into at the mall. After that my supervisor did not give her the important duties. As she said she has not believed her anymore. In addition you need to make up more lies to complete your lies. You should make up more excuses to make your lies reasonable and sometimes the make up excuses are not believed. For instance when I was a child I sometimes played with my classmates after school. My parents asked me why I am home late. I just pretended my teacher asked us to stay at school. And my parents kept asking me why. I kept making up some situation. Consequently I could not think of any excuses so I told them the truth. I was punished because I told a lie not I played with my classmates late. To conclude I believe that people should not tell the lies. If you told a lie you would not be trust by your friends and coworkers. And you also need more lies to make your lies reasonable and persuadable. People had better not tell lies.
