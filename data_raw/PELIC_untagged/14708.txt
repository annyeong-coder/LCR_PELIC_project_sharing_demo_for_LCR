I acknowledge that I had learned a lot from Mr. ANON_NAME_0 my favorite teacher in primary school. He got us to memorize long poems. In that time it did not have me understand the benefits of such activity but its concept is obvious now. The older man had enough experience to make me love reading. He used to ask his students to read a new story every two weeks. It was hard task for young but I liked it because he let us to choose what we read. The most important point was to understand what we read. Even he was treating children he used to push us towards using our minds his creative ways helped me to equip myself with some useful techniques that I use today to deal with my kids.
