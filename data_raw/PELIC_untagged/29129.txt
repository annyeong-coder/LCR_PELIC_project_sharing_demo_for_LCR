Since the dawn of man crime has existed as an adverse thing that disturbs the balance of life. Throughout that history of mankind people have created and improved many systems and rules traditional and later written in the modern civilization to govern life and act like buffers to societies that set a clear boundaries to people's behavior. However as humans are not perfect creatures the way people dealt with limits are not always agreed upon by all people. Perhaps one of the most controversial rules is the death penalty. As societies get more civilized people prospective and attitude towards this sentence change dramatically and humanitarian organization as well as ordinary people argue all the time about weather its right for courts to still use death as punishment. In fact many organization and parliaments' representatives are persistently calling for the abandonment of death penalty as they consider it a violation to the natural rights of human. Many would think that executing serious criminals who had killed or raped many innocent people would really satisfy true justice. However there are many other ways to achieve the goal of justice without the need of taking lives or endorsing the concept of eye for an eye .
