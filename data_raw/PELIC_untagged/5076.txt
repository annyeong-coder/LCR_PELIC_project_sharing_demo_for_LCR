I have been planning on applying master degree since I came here. Unfortunately I have not done that yet because I have not completed all requirements yet such as toefel and GRE tests. I have already started to study toefl. I have been attending tofel class and I plan to get a tofel test next month after I ready for that then I will start studying for GRE.
