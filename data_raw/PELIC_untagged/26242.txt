Movies That I Like Movies are beautiful. A lot of people who like movies can enjoy it at the theater or home with their friends. Some people likes to watch drama movie and some may go with science fiction. For me I don't like it. Actually I like 3 kinds of movies that are horror action and comedy. Why I'm mad of horror movies That's exactly what I'm up to talk about. For me horror movies are life. I like that feeling when I'm afraid of something and try to see what's the end. First at the night when I'm sitting alone and watching a horror movie I feel so afraid but I enjoy it. Second I prefer to watch it alone that make feel scares and strong emotion. Finally those feelings give me energy and power to have a brave heart. What about action movies Action movies are never being boring. First I have to give all attention during watching this kind of movies which it may waste my free time so fast. Second watching this kind of movies make me think a lot so my mind will never wander. Also I think that's the person who created these movies is genius that make people who watch his movies just thinking what will happen next what's going on how it could be possible etc. Finally this kind of movies is the most popular kind for those reasons. Comedy movies are great for many things that it has. First the comedy film is created to make people happy when they're watching it. The creator made it for fun. Second when you watch thins kind of movies you will forget everything and just laughing and being happy. Finally I like comedies because It makes my mind clear as I returned to the life from the begging.
