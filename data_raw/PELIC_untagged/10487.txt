My topic is good things happen when you least expect them. When 15years old left my house my father company failed sad very hard work buy house and car have restaurant we can again happy When 15years old My family left other city because my father's company failed . Then South Korea was International Monetary Fund IMF . The most companies failed. We lost everything our house our factory and car etc. We were very sad but my family worked very hard and I studied very hard. After 5years I got my job and also my brother got a job. After then my family bought a house two cars and a rastaurant. We again found laugh. I hoped that time.
