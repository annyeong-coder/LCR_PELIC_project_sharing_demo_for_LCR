I wake up at 7 00. After taking shower having break fast I go to school by walk. Actually I used to take a bus to go school. But one day I recognized I put on weights. Because my jeans was small to me. So I made up my mind that I need exercise since then. I've been walking to school for 2 weeks. Fortunately my weight is getting turn back to my previous weight up to now. But it's difficult to go on loosing weight. The reason is that I should sit at the desk as soon as finished meal. So I am just going to try to keep on the weight even thought I don't turn back to my previous weight yet. Anyway let's move on to the my day's work. When I get into school I am taking five classes. It's kind of hard to me. If I don't keep at studying I can't catch up with my classes. After school I usually take a nap for 1 hours which helps me control my condition. After nap I usually check out how many homework I have If I don't have many homework I ask ANON_NAME_0 who is ELI student to come out and play. But If I have many homework I always try to finish it up quickly to hang out with friends. And I go to bed at 12 0'clock. Such a simple life!!
