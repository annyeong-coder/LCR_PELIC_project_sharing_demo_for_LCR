I hoped I could grasp English soon through studing in a free language school soon after I came to this country. I didn't understand the teacher's simple questions like where are you from Is he your husband One month later I got tired and quit. I began to work in a research lab where I had chance to talk English a little after a little I began to talk more. I felt satisfied about it and thought this was enough for me without the need of learning the languageafter work. I seldom watched American TV programs instead I read on line Chinese news and watched Chinese dramas. My daughter has graduated with fluent English. However my English has stayed in a level for a long time. The worst thing is that I came to realized that research work I have spent a lot of time on is terrible for people's health. I felt regretted. I wish I would have changed my mind then. If I had not felt tired at the beginning I would have continued the studying. If I had studyed longer I would have found it interesting. I wish I had spent some time in learning every day without stopping in the past years. If I had continued to learn the language during the work my English would be much better. If my English were good I would change the type of my work. I hope some day I can handle the language a lot better through the help of English classes and through my continuous effort. Or else I would have classmates younger than my daughter.
