For many of the busy people there's no place like 'Yokoso' the Japanese restaurant in Pittsburgh. Yokoso has all the conditions that a good restaurant has to have. I will show a couple of reasons taste price and service and location that you cannot help going to have meal there. For one thing Yokoso offers the best taste of Japan. They have mainly two parts of dish soy source food and sushi and both of them have the greatest taste. It was exactly the same taste when I visited Japan a few years ago. Because they always seek freshness it cannot help having and keeping good taste. Fortunately most Americans also enjoy the exotic and fabulous taste as well as Asian. Second of all the prices of dishes are not that cheap but it is reasonable. If you would like to eat some soy source food the chief himself may cook your dishes in front of you. That is they are confident to serve their food and it can be a proof of cleanness of food. Furthermore all waiter and waitress are far kinder than any other restaurant. If you are serve food and other intangible services there you will have in mind to go and have meals there over and over. The last but not the least Yokoso is located in Waterfront mall and it's easy to find and get there. In general shoppers get tired after their shopping especially if the mall tends to be larger than the usual mall and you will be much hungrier. No wonder shoppers look for some places to grab a bite. In this point Yokoso in Waterfront mall is perfect place to eat and rest. Moreover as far as it is in the mall you never worry about parking space. Even if you are not a shopper you can get there by car without worrying about parking. All in all Yokoso doesn't have any weaknesses to serve customers. These are because of convenience of access understandable price with service and indeed Japanese taste. Although some Americans aren't interested in Asian food Yokoso can change their taste and mind.
