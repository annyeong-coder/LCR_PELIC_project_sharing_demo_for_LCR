If you visit South Korea and when you meet people who are older than you had better not touch their heads with your hand. If you see elderly people while you are sitting on the bus you should offer your seat to them. I think this is very important for you. Also when you dump trash you should buy standard plastic bag. Next you had better not quiver your leg when you eat food. And you ought to not cross when you are talking with old people. While you are drinking alcohol with a man in front you and his glass is empty who you should fill up the glass. In addition when you fill the glass you should hold the bottle with both hands. This is our drinking culture. Last of all you should get open mind that understand korean.
