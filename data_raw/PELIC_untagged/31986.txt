EMINA'S TIME CAPSULE Hi a New generation! Today is Thursday 23 February 2012. By the way today is my 28th Birthday! We celebrate it and you ! So it is easy to conclude that I lived a long time ago in a place named The United States Of America. I buried it underground because I want you to know how we used to live. The capsule contains several items. Each of them has a different story about today's life. Certainly our life moves quickly. Sometimes we can only remember life's details from pictures. Normally we take pictures almost every day. That is why I put in a camera and some printed pictures of me. These pictures describe how people and cities look today and what we wear and what kind of food we eat. There is a watch and some banknotes money from different countries. Money is one of the most important things in our life. Very popular saying in 21st Century is Time is money! Can you imagine how little free or extra time we have and how fast we have to run for money ! However this is our life style but I am sad I can't predict anything about your life. Also I added my old cell phone just let you know how it seemed! We use it a lot to communicate with each other from everywhere. In brief that would be all from me. Enjoy life is too short. . . . . Good luck Emina Bambur Sejdic
