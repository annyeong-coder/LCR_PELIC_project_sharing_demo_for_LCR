In my opinion I totally disagree with that the Internet is a good place to meet a romantic partner. People on the Internet sometimes tell lies. For example one man can pretend to be a nice guy when he wants to hang out with a woman. However he just wants to take advantage of her. It happens everywhere in the world. In conclusion I think that it is not a good way to meet a romantic partner through the Internet.
