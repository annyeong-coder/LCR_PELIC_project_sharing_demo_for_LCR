I am going to write about a dilemma I have faced. I travelled to Niagara's Fall in july with my family by car. On our way to driving there we lost the way several times. We wasted much time and my childrens were much tired of staying at the car. We should have looked up the map to the last detail. On the other hand we might have brought some toys because they could play with the toys. Finally we arrived at a hotel in the evening and it was hard to look for the good restaurant. We should have examine the infomations of some restaurants. We went to the restaurant which we accidentaly looked for. The cost was expensive but the taste was not good. We thought that next time we should examine the infoemations of destination bofore.
