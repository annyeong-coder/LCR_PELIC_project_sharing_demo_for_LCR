There are a lot of nations which have abundant natural resources in the worlds. They are very useful to develop their countries. For example Saudi Arabia is a wealthy country because of their oil. Japan however they have more human resources than natural resources. They have been developing by human resources. In addition human resources are made from good education. Natural resources can be disappeared because of the limitation but human resources with good education can be remained because they have no limitation unless human being is wiped out. Thus I believe that education is more important to a nation's wealth than natural resources. Relevant quotation turnabout
