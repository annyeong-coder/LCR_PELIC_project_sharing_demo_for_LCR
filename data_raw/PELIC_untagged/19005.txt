If the money were not subject I would go to Greek I have three reasons to say that the natural beauty of the land history of Greek and our common traditions. The first reason is that when I was a child my uncle who studied medicine in Greek he used to talk about that beautiful place in the world making me very interesting to see it and then After I so many TV programs showing the beautiful Islands in the Mediterranean sea I like it more. Second after I grow up and I had enough knowledge I like it more because of the deep history of the Greek also their culture which is more beautiful than the land itself. Finally I like it because they have so many traditions similar to ours but different way make more interested to learn about them. In general I always like to travel so much anywhere in the world and learn more cultures but If I have to choose only one place Greek is really nice place to visit.
