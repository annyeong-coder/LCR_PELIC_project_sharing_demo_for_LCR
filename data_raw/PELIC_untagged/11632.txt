Dear Mr. ANON_NAME_0 Regarding the workshop that was held in Hillman Library on Friday March 21 2008 I really appreciate the useful information about how I can use the library database research which you have provided. Your presentation has been invaluable to me during this class and future classes too. Again thank you so much. I greatly appreciate your effort. Best Regards ANON_NAME_1 Last Name ELI's Student
