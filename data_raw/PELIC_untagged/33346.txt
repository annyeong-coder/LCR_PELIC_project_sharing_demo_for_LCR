The Leisureville Villages is the area that there is no burden responsibility or problem for senior citizen. The most comfortable life is lived by elderly people in this village. As the one of the experts of the article says the life down here promises to be a lot more carefree than it was back home . So people who live in this area do not care about anything except enjoying eating drinking dancing. . Etc their life. However I wouldnt like to live in a similar community when I am a senior citizen. This type of life reminds me of kind of an isolation. It sounds as though people withdraw into their own worlds and set them apart from other people. As a result I wouldnt rather live there.
