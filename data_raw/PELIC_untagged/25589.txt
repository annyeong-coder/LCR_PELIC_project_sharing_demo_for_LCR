My new bedroom is painted over with white. I put some black and green items in. This decoration always calms me down after having a long day. I have a crab mirror hung up on the wall and reflects the sunshine when it comes in the room. This beautiful reflection of the sunlight mixed with different colors lights the bedroom up during the day. This outstanding atmosphere cheers me up especially when some bad news broke me down. However there are some scratch on the wall and I will touch them up soon. The brown carpet I bought to try it out first did not match with the ambiance of the room so I took it back in the store. I needed to figure out which one could fit better. I checked all the color out in Ikea store and finally I picked the light green carpet out for my bed room. My roommates chipped me in a lot with some items to be set up. I clean my bedroom up and its environment makes me happier after some bad days brought me down.
