ANON_NAME_0 is my classmate who is learning English at ELI at PITT. She will return her home country after she finishes the English course of this semester. She isn't going to continue studying English until she graduates this term. She also won't get a job while she is in US. She will continue her work as a tourism guide when she returns her country. But before she returns her country she will travel some famous places in US such as New York Disney etc.
