My hobby is playing piano. I have been playing piano for fifteen years. When I was a child my parents wanted to train my patience and perseverance. They decided to buy a piano for me. My piano teacher was a friend of my father's. She was very strict to me. I had been required to practice piano for at least one hour before I went to bed everyday. I have been listening the piano music all the time. I have been in Pittsburgh for few months. There are a lot of musician have been performing in this areas. It made me like Pittsburgh.
