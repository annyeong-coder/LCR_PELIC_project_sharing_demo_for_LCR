These are many mountains in Korea. My hometown has two great mountains. I used to live in the city for 18 years. The city was surrounded by the two mountains. My house was almost in front of the one mountain so I could enjoy many things from mountain. The mountain had beautiful sight in every season. In spring I could see a bunch of flowers of white pink and yellow colors in the middle of green tree and even their smell came into my window. In summer the mountain was filled with green so they made me feel cool. In fall all of the green was changed to red yellow and brown. They reminded me a picture of landscape. In winter after snowing it was covered by the snow. Everything looked like pure because of the white color. Mountains are beautiful in Korea especially I miss the one of my hometown's mountains because I really enjoyed watching it in all the seasons.
