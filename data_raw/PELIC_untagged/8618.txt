When I was a high school student I decided to be a doctor. If my mother hadn't been a doctor I wouldn't have come up with the idea. Moreover if my older sister had planed to be a doctor I might not have applied for a medical school. Actually my sister hated to be a doctor and she had already decided to study English literature. I thought I should be a doctor because my mother opened a clinic in Kyoto. If I hadn't entered a medical school I would be a teacher at an elementary school. Before thinking about being a doctor I wanted to be a teacher at an elementary school. When I graduated from the university I chose to be an ophthalmologist. If my mother hadn't been an ophthalmologist I would have chosen another subject. I was working as a doctor for seven years in Japan before I came here. I should have had much more experience to help my mother in the future but I was so busy and tired that I couldn't be enthusiastic about my job. As a result I don't have enough knowledge to help my mother now. I wish I had been absorbed into my job. I feel very happy to be a doctor and I don't regret my decision at all. After I go back to Japan I hope I will acquire a lot of knowledge become more skillful doctor and help my mother.
