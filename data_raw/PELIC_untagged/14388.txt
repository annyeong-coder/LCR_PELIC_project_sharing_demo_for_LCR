Recipe for Russian Okroshka I would like to offer a resipe for Russian okroshka . Okroshka looks like soup but it's not boiled. It's very easy to prepare and delicious. To cook okroshka a few ingredients are required smoked meat boiled eggs boiled potatoes and fresh cucumber. All these ingredients should be chopped. And put into bowl. After that Russian Kvass should be added. Kvass is a bitter and sour beverage which is similar to beer but alcohol free. The dish should be served cold. Many Russian people like to eat okroshka in Summer when it's hot.
