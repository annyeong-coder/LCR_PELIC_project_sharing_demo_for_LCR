I am an extrovert person who loves to be with others I like to go out with my friends a lot. From my little experience in life I think that I am a sensor person that I usually notice very well what is going around me. I am a thinker all of my decisions are reasonable which I think about in a specific way. In the fourth category I am a judger who makes a lot of decisions to make things settle.
