Chinese New Year In China people have a special celebration for Spring Festival every year. We call it Chinese Lunar New Year. In this holiday people gather their family to celebrate the Lunar New Year's coming. There are three important things must to be done lots of preparation family reunion dinner and celebration in temple. To get ready for the holiday first people always buy a great deal of flowers such as chrysanthemum peach blossom narcissus kumquat and so on. Different flowers have different allegories. For example kumquat means good fortune for the people. Next people also buy fruits sweets and food beside flowers. Then people would clean their houses. Finally the houses can be decorated with red decorations and the flowers. In addition family reunion dinner is most important for Chinese people in New Year's Eve. Very early on that day people begin to cook a lot of food. After cooking they put the food on altar as offering for their ancestors. Eventually people get together to have family reunion dinner. At the first day of New Year majority of people are likely to go to temple. They bring food from home and buy incense there for Buddha in order to get blessing. After going to temple most people share the food with their relatives. During this holiday people who work in other localities all year round also get home to celebrate and have family reunion dinner with their families. In fact Chinese Lunar New Year is not only a traditional holiday but also a day for reunion of family.
