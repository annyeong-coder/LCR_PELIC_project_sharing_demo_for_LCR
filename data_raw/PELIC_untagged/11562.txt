My classmates Mike and Jon are both good basketball players. But they have different styles. Mike is taller than Jon. Mike is the tallest in their team while Jon is the shortest one. Mike plays less aggressively than Jon and he runs less fast than Jon. Jon runs the fastest of any player in their team. Mike plays the most fearlessly. He throws more successfully than Jon. But Jon catches and passes more frequently. They are the best partners.
