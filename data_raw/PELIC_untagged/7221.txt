Thesis Parents are the earliest teacher we have in our lives but not the best teachers. First of all not all parents are good teachers. As normal individuals some parents more or less have bad habits. Even though parents almost instinctively devote themselves to cultivating their children the result might turn out to be disappointment for all children tend to copy every thing from their parents. Another disadvantage of parents as teachers is the fact that most parents are lack of common senses of education. All too often we observe some parents fail by forcing their children to develop in a prearranged direction. On the contrary if their children did not follow the instructions the children would be regarded as disobedient. In fact it is parents rather than their children that virtually disobey common senses.
