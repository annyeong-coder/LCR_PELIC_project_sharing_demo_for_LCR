No matter my present or my future life there are a number of thoughts in my mind recently. I want to improve my English skill not just for academic tests but for communication in usual live. For example learning some slangs besides the vocabularies of books in schools. I want to use my leisure time to familiarize the softwares of computers such as excel or photoshop to make me more competitive. I want to start to realize the concept of stock market and concern the fluctuation of economy. I am supposed to think more and deeply for getting a better life.
