I have received a scholarship from my government. It was memorable event in my life because it was my dream. While I was studying my bachelor I planed to do my master and PhD. After I got my bachelor degree in Physical Therapy I worked for couples of years to collect money for the tuition. Fortunately while I was working to collect money for tuition my government announced to offer scholarships for students. I have applied to get a scholarship and I have gotten immediately the approval. Now I'm studying English. Next semester I will start in my program and I hope to achieve my dream which is getting PhD in physical therapy.
