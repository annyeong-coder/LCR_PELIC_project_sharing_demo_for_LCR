I think Culinary Tourism is the strangest tourism of the four types of tourism. The other three types of tourism are challenging more or less. The culinary tourism is distinct from them. It doesn't need to experience dangerous things. It's strange to learn how to cook other countries' food instead of never cooking at home.
