The authors assert that children arrive to school full of energy and curiosity but that by the third or fourth year they have lost the sense of pleasure in their own learning. Do you agree or disagree Why I agree with this statement. I think that creativity is inherent to human being and that creativity comes with every kid when they are born. If that is like I say why the streets from United States are not full of Polloks Millers and Hendrixs Why the streets from Spain are not full of Cervantes Dalis and Pacos de Luc ents generation was worry in follow schedules give hundreds of options and provide a lot of activities to their kids. This brought people worry about the rules and focus in succeed more than enjoying things they are doing. On the other hand this generation of parents people of my age wants to cultivate creativity dosen't matter what and because of that they read books buy DVDs and go to classes that have names as Child of Wonder Nurturing Creative and Naturally Curious Children . The problem is they are so strict in reach their goal that they also kill the creativity of their children who have to follow 'a manual' with rigid steps. I think that creativity is something natural and parents and teachers have to provide a adequate environment to increase it but creativity can be imposed.
