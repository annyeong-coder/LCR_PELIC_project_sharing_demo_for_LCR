1 Brady RD APT 67 Pittsburgh PA 15213 Mar 21 2007 Dear Aamed How are you I'm very good. I saw for you a good quality apartment and house. They are very nosey and comfortable but they are different in many ways and now I'll tell you some information for that. First the house is more expensive than the apartment because the house is more modern than the apartment. So you need to pay 950 per month for house but you need to pay only 600 per month for the apartment. Second the apartment doesn't have as much space as the house so I think the house is better for you because you have a family. For example the house has two parking spaces however the apartment only has one parking space and also the house has driveway. Also the house bigger the apartment so the house has enough spaces for you for example in house there are three bedrooms but in the apartment there are only two bedrooms. Another space the house has yard but the apartment doesn't have any yard so then I think the house is better for you because the house has much space for your children and you. Than your family have space for play and for cook BBQ. Third the apartment is near the subway and it is in the downtown on the other hand the house isn't near the subway and it isn't in the downtown. I think you don't have any problem with that because you and your wife have cars. Also the apartment isn't as private as the house so I think the house is more suitable for you. Finally I think the house is more better that the apartment. Please let me ANON_NAME_0 what you think and if you have any suggestion or any questions Good luck my friend Sincerely
