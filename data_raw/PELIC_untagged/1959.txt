My parents met each other in a party. It was a party which was held by my uncle to celebrate my mother's 20 years old birthday. My uncle invited his good friend Michael to join the party and asked him to invite one more guy to join the party together. Thus Michael invited my father to join it. Before the birthday party my mother and my father hadn't seen each other although they lived in the same area. When they met in the party they danced and chatted happily. After the party they dated usually and got married when they were 25 years old.
