The worst food I've ever had is pickles. I can't eat any kinds of pickles even the food which has touched the pickles. Their tastes and appearances are unacceptable. The tastes are nothing but sore and the looks are dead vegetable. I encountered a shocking layout plate when I went to a restaurant in Florida. I ordered a hamburger and soon after the plate came over me. I saw a huge cucumber pickle next to the hamburger on the plate. The pickle was emphasized very much. The hamburger seemed smaller than usual. In addition I don't like pickled olives but if a pickled olive in a grass of Martini I'm going to eat it.
