My apartment is tiny but clean. Because I like straighten the room up. I hung my big picture up on the door of closet. So I can see me everyday when I take off clothes. I like my apartment. But as my sister do study I am almost crazy. Because she turns the light on all night I can't sleep well. Sometimes my apartment is showed the ghost up. I think that is the most special distinction of my apartment.
