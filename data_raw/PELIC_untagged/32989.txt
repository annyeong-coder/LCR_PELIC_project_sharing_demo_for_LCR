Stephen Dole wrote a report Habitable Planets for Man toe study life in the space. This includes a record of human's evolution toward the universe. Habitability means a planet has water which indicates surface temperature is between 0 and 100 Celsius. According to Kepler results and telescopic findings there are a lot of rocky planets like the earth in the space. They are usually smaller and less orbits than our planet. Even though many sciences have found planets alike the earth they usually are identified uninhabitable. The planet HD85512 b could be residential if this planet fits into conditions to live people on. Also tweaking some of the factors decide where planet we can live on. Big moons can stay atmospheres and be the energy habitable planets are. Some planets have mild climate but these don't have water. Whenever we find potential habitable planets we should carefully investigate them. Stephen Dole estimated several habitable planets exist and it looks like he might be correct.
