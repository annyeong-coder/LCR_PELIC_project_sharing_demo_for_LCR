My Cat I like cats very much. So this story about my cat. When I was 18 years old my mother bought a cat for me. It was gray and I gave this cat the name ALEX. First when my mother gave me my cat it was very small. And ate just milk. Everyone liked this cat. Second after two years my father didn't like my cat because his hair was everywhere and my father had allergies. He told me to put the cat outside. Finally I put my cat outside. In three weeks my cat went out in to the street and a car came hit my cat and killed her. I cried because I loved this cat. After my cat died I will never buy any animal because I don't want it to die like my cat.
