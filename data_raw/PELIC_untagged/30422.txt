I'm sorry about your situation. I will try to give you advices as much as I can. First you should have told your boyfriend about your feelings before he left. Anyway it is too late to regret so let's move on. According my experience you'd better be sure about your feelings before you visit him. If you are not positively sure your relationship could be worse in the future. After that you ought to talk with him before you decide everything. It must be better than you decide alone. And if you two have same feelings you could think about quitting your job and move to his place. Take your time. You don't have to rush your decision.
