My name is ANON_NAME_0. ANON_NAME_1 is my given name and it means perfume . ANON_NAME_2 is my husband's family name and it means north . Although I love my name I have a complaint about it. Because it seems like a Chinese name for Japanese people. Every time someone says to me You speak Japanese very well I have to explain that I am not Chinese so it always bothers me. But now I am living in USA. I think basically it is vary difficult for most American people to find the difference between Japanese Chinese Korean and Taiwanese. And I am always taking mistake about the nationality of Asian people too. Therefore I don't mind about my name now.
