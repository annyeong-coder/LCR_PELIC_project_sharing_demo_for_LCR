From my perspective the most important factors that make me happy are Achieving personal goals parents' satisfaction and visiting new places. Achieving personal objectives is a crucial factor that causes happiness for me. As a result of achieving personal objective whether educational or career objectives I feel satisfied and stimulated to do more and more. For example when I earned my undergraduate degree with distinction I felt satisfied and stimulated to pursue a graduate degree. Parents' satisfaction makes me feel self confident and comfortable. Subsequently when my parents feel happy and proud of me I feel lucky and succeeded especially in difficult situations. This fortune in my point of view is attributed to parents' satisfaction. For instance when I applied for jobs after graduating from university I received many employment offers most of which from prominent companies which I hadn't expected. Visiting new places rejuvenates me and makes me feel better. Due to seeing new places and new culture I feel happy and amused by interacting and coping with those people and culture. Therefore this interaction relives stress and guides me to happiness. For example when I visited China last year I felt happy and interacted with the new people and culture there.
