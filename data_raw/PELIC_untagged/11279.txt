I do not have so many friends that I can call confidants but they are really important for my life. The life without my friends who can understand me is very boring. My friend who lives in Tokyo is working for a Japanese trading company whose name is Mitsubishi. She had lived in London for her assignment which was very rare case at that time. I was very proud of her who was living alone in foreign country which is far from Japan. I admired her who always tried to do her best as much as possible. Since she came back to Japan we have often traveled all over the cities where we loved to go. Wherever we went we could enjoy all day long. Last summer when I came to Pittsburgh she came to USA to meet me who felt lonely. We are not two women of pursuits and tastes. However or therefore we can understand each other. I can believe her who helps me whenever it needs and I would like to be a kind of people whom she could believe. I can not picture to myself what it must be to have no friends that I can call confidants.
