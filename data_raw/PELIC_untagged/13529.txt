I think the type which best fits me is perceiver. It is because I don't like to plan everything which is supposed to make. When I hang out with my friends I don't like have exactly time when we should meet. Also I would like to have different experiences such as I don't like to go to the place where we usually go. I meet with my friends in different places. I think I am the person who cares the different atmospheres in different places. Therefore I don't have a particular place which I always hang out with my friends. And I think most of my friends whose personalities are similar with me are also like to have fun in different ways. I think people who have the same type with me sometimes are not on time and always change their minds in different reasons. Unlike them I am not every bad at time and I swear what I have said. I believe that every type's person doesn't have the same character. We can't definite people in six types.
