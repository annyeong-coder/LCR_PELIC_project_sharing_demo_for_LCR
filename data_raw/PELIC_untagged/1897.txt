Topic What is your dream vacation For most of my life my dream vacation has been to visit England. This dream is going to come true. I've planed to travel around Europe in this summer before I go back to my country. My mother is going to visit my sister and me in April. She is also going to come to a graduate ceremony for my sister. After that we are going to England and other countries in Europe. We are going to visit London Leeds Nottingham Southampton Liverpool New castle and Manchester where I'm going to see Manchester United match because this team is my favorite soccer team. If we have enough time we will travel to other countries around there. I hope that there will be wonderful places for our vacation. I want to gain a lot of new experiences which I have never seen. For another vacation my dream vacation has been to visit Japan again. I have been there when I was 10 years old so I almost forget about that vacation. I know that I have been in Tokyo and Osaka with my family. We have visited Mount Fujiyama. By that time I had never seen snow before so I was very surprised when I saw snow over there. I want to visit Japan again and get more experience.
