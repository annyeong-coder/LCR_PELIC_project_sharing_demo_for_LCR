I'm going write about my best friend ANON_NAME_0 who has a wonderful sense of humor. We graduated form high school where is in our neighborhood. ANON_NAME_0 is someone who lends me money when I need it. Also ANON_NAME_0 is someone who listens to my problems when I want talk. ANON_NAME_0 is someone who has known me for a very long time. ANON_NAME_0 is someone who gives me advice when I'm in troubles.
