Become A Good Friend There are many important things to become a good friend. I think listening respect and telling the truth. First a good friend always listens to you. You can tall a good friend everything when you are unhappy. They will keep the secrets for you. They won't laugh at you even the secrets are trivial. For example I always tell one of my friends if I'm unhappy and she never tell others. Second a good friend will respect you. They accept who you are and don't expect you to change for them. They won't make you do things you don't want to do. A good friend will respect the decision you made. For instance I met a Korean in the U. S. And we became good friends even we have different culture and living habits. Third a good friend will tell you the truth. They won't lie to you in order to make you happy. You can get useful opinion from them. They will correct you when you misbahave. For example sometimes my friends will ask each other to lower the voice if we speak too laud in public places. It is not easy to be a good friend but I holp I can become a person like this.
