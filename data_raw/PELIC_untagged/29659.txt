Chef Ramsey who is a famous British chef once said We have become a nation of food lovers and restaurant goers and he is absolutely right. Personally I like going to restaurants and trying different kinds of cuisines but I have never met someone who likes food and describes it with countless of description as my friend does. For her food is a pleasure and there is nothing better than surrounding yourself with good friends and family members around a table of tasty dishes. In fact I still recall that day when she was telling me about her experience at a restaurant in Qatar. She said The restaurant which is decorated in a traditional Qatari style is a place where you can be treated like a queen for one night. According to her what makes this restaurant stand out is the amazing service as they have a very nice way of relaxing customers. She felt she was more than welcome and they gave her the impression that they were enjoying serving her. She told me that the restaurant had a wide range of traditional Middle Eastern and Qatari dishes such as Thareed and Kabsa all of which were delicious and sophisticated. But what she distinctly remember about that restaurant was the lovely aromas of the Arabic spice and the fresh baked bread. Yet there was one special dish she really savored a lamb meat dish. She said and I am quoting I was absolutely blown away by its beautiful presentation. It was visually stunning and it tasted good as well. She also added But what amazed me more was the meat which was tender to the point I felt it melted in my mouth. She described how it was seasoned perfectly and how wonderful combination of flavors texture and taste it had. From the way she described it I felt that the food was done with passion love and knowledge and that they took the Middle Eastern food to a whole new level of sophistication. My friend changed my perception about the Qatari food and told me another story about food I will never forget.
