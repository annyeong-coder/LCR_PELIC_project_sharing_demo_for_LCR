In my country we don't have many days of the holydays . Just we have 3 days per year. Two of which are religious holydays and the third one is the National day holyday. That day to remembrance unification of the Kingdom. That day is important for Saudi people for several reason such as strengthen the affiliation to the home we remembrance hestory of the grandparents and many of the decisions issue on this day. First reason strengthen the affiliation In each country have a special day like it but they have difrent call for example in USA they call it indbendense day. I think this day when you watch TV and see what were achieved these people of development alike constructional or technology and development of human.
