Wrting5T 6 6 07 Topic Some of my country's most beautiful sights The beautiful beaches and the beautiful mountains In my opinion Taiwan has the most beautiful beaches and the most beautiful mountains in the world. Taiwan has been called Formosa by Portuguese about five hundred years ago when they first passed Taiwan. Formosa means the beautiful island. First the most beautiful beaches are in the south part of Taiwan named Kenting. There are four or five beaches and bay with good landscape. Every summer have many people go there to enjoy their vacation. It's a good place to sightsee play water and swim in the sea. Finally the most beautiful mountains are Alishan and Yushan. We can go there for hiking breath fresh air see nice view and take some hot spring. The most famous view is seeing the sun raise up in the early morning. If you visit to Taiwan you should go the beautiful beaches at the summer and the beautiful mountains at anytime.
