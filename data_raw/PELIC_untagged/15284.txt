My family had seven people. Father mother three older sisters and one younger brother. The oldest sister she lives in America. Before she came to America she wasn't able to cook but now she is able to cook. The second sister she worked in Taiwan and she was able to cook when she worked in Taiwan. My third sister she like to go to sea. But she isn't able to swim. My brother he is a lawyer. He wasn't able to drive but I think he 'll able to drive soon because my father is able to teach him to drive. I wasn't able to speak English language. But now I am able to speak English language better than past.
