Tourism is an important issue. It has a lot of arguments. Tourism is considered a way to improve the economy. Also it is considered a solution to environment's problems. For example in Ecuador the Achuar's eco tourism lodge believed that tourism is the best way to protect the environment after they had been aware that oil extraction has created problems of the environment. On other hand it is said that the tourism has emerged as one of the underlying things of the environment's problems. That is since it requires deforestation due to building hotels fields and transportation which is producing a hug amount of carbon dioxide the principal cause of global worming. In my opinion for Ecuador or any country wants to set up tourism should be aware that developing the tourism has many potential impacts on the people and the environment
