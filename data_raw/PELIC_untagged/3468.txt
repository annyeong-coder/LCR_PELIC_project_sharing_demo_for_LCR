I think students will have many problems if the use the technology that make them studying at home. On of the problems that they might face is the understanding. They may have some question that should explaining. So how they will contact with someone have experience. An addition they students might delay studying until the face the test and that will be effects on them. Rather than if they have a class and they have to attend. Also they could cheat I mean the could have another computer or another person how will help them. So I don't thing it good idea.
