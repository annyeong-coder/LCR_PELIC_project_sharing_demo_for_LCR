I went to a ski resort near pittsburgh to enjoy snowboarding but there was a problem. What I had as a problem was that I hadn't ridden a snowboard for about 6 years and I gained 20 pounds more than the last time I rode it. When I got the first riding at that day I tried to ride on the slope where my friend passed but not chasing him but balancing my body was the first priority to me. Finally What I did funny was I entered the wrong high level slope where a competition was going on and someone was explaining what happened on the slope. I couldn't escape and just rolled and rolled to reach the bottom because my reduced ability and exhaust. My rolling was on air! Now I can smile about what happened at that time but at that time I couldn't see anybody but the ground due to embarrassment. Even I failed down again when I tried to escape from the place after arriving the bottom. I think that what I did there was a very similar thing with the comic movies' scenes.
