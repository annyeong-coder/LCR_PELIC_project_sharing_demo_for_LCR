I've been living in Pittsburgh for seven months. In the first few months I didn't work hard in my study because I spent much of my time in hang out with friends and chat with my friends in my city. But now I knew how to organize my time in playing and studying. I've been studying more than two hour a day and I've been reading an English newspaper since January. Also I've done every assignment that my teacher gave me. I'm taking care of my health now. I've been working out twice time a week for three months. Every day I drink more than a liter of water and eat many veggies. I've been watching four movies a week for five months. I think it can help me improve my listening skills. Recently I'm interesting in painting. I've painted two pictures in this month. I hope I will find more interesting stuff to do in the future.
