I have been told about this story. Someone was very rich and he was very helpful. Since he got rich he helped all the people around him. Also his brother who was blacksmith was helpful. Both brothers lived in the same city until they reached the forty. Then they left to another city where a lot of work had. The main reason for moving is that they were looking for more money. Yet they did not trust the people surround them. Then they came up with idea to test the people. What they were looking for the fact that they needed to know how honest helpful and trustful those people. The idea was that they would go in traveling to bring a load and they put all their money on it when they come back some of gang steal their money and the load. They did the small movie to test the people in the new city. Then they ran to the city before their caravan reach the city and asked the people for their help but no one helped them except one old woman who lived in next door gave them some money and some weapon that she owned. After that they brought their money and load and told the old woman the story. Embarrassed people by position they tried to apologize but nothing would occur. Then they moved from that city and took with them the old woman to live with them.
