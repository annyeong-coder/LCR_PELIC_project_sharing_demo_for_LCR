One of my friends who is important to me met me in highschool. We were in the same freshman class. I prepared to go art university and she was just studying while we were in same class. We were very close frienda although our major wasn't the same. She entered the university of elementary education but I didn't enter the university right after graduation. I was preparing to go the university when she was a freshman. She was always encouraging me. She helped me study well because she was at the top of the whole school when we were highschool students. I finally entered the university. We started to go the university in same city Seoul. So we could meet often. And we are keeping our friendship.
