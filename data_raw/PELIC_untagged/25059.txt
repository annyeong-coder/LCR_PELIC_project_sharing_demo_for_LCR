Generation gap is a gap in views between children and parents. There are always differences between generations. Differences such as music and cloth choice can lead to a small argument between parents and children. Other differences like moral values or respect for others can create problems in a family and even make it collapse. Music choice is one of the differences between generations. Have you ever seen your parents listening to Lady Gaga's songs I guess the answer is no. There is a simple explanation to this question Our parents grew up in a totally different society and time. If now people value singer's fancy dresses and clips our parents valued their voices. They don't and can't listen to the songs we do. SO when we listen to the music that we like our parents get frustrated and sometimes this leads to an argument between us and them. As time passes away everything changes with it even moral values. The fact that children stopped caring about their families is unfortunately unavoidable. For the previous generation a family was the most precious thing that they had which is true. It is not easy to build a family but once it's built it becomes a small world where you share you happy and sad moments with people that you love. When all friends turn away from you when you feel lonely and hopeless family is always there to support you. Our generation don't understand this. For them family is just a place where you can live eat and nothing more. Once they grew up they forget about people that tried their best to make them happy. As the result of it you can see so many lonely people that haven't been visited by their children for years and years. A generation gap is found almost in every family. There isn't really a way to solve this problem but by arguing and trying to prove one's truth is not the right way to deal with it either.
