I remember an incident with my friends in McDonald's. When my friend walked up to the counter to order large fries she said I would like to get a large fried rice with tomato sauce. What was funny about this was that she said fried rice while thinking that she said fries. What was also funny was that she was fluent in english but she accidentally said tomato sauce rather than ketchup. I don't know whether or not she had enough sleep the night before but it was a funny and embarrassing incident at McDonald's that time.
