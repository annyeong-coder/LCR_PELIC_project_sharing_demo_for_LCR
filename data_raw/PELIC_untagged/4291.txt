I use the Internet for three main things. First off all I use it for check my e mail. I spend one hour everyday to read and send emails. Second I use the internet for searching. My favorite one is Google. It takes about more than tow ours to find what I want. It doesn't happen everyday ordinary but sometime I make my research day by day per week. Finally I need the internet to submit my homework that is given for me in the ELI.
