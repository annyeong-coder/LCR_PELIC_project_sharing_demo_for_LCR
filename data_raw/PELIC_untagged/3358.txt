Hi Bill I've already bought the beer but I haven't gotten the camera yet. You can't bring to me the camera I've already ordered the camera by internet. In fact I haven't cleaned the sofa yet but I've already gotten DJ for the party. I called to Zake to bring to me a big table but he hasn't brough the table yet. He has already brough the other table last party.
