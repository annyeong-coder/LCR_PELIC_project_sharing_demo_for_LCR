I am writing this homework to introduce myself to you. My name is Rocio Last Name but all my friends call me Ro because it is shorter. I am from Argentina and I born in a small city near the capital of Argentina. Its name is Bahia Blanca so I am used to living in small cities like Pittsburgh. When I was in High School I realized that I would be a MD because I really like to help people and cooperate with the society. In addition I obviously think that health is a relevant aspect in our lives. During my career when I was 21 I had one beautiful daughter. Her name is Fatima. After I finished that I acquired the ophthalmologist tittle. These days I am studying English and I am trying to achieve a good use of English. Also I am cooking and driving more.
