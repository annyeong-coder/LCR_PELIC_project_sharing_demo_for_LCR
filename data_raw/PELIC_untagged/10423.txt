My apartment consists of 1 bedroom and 1 eat in kitchen. My bedroom directs north so it has no sunshine at any time. This brings me down. But my kitchen is bright and sunny. It always cheers me up. So most of my home time I stay in the kitchen for cooking or doing my homework. Last week I and my husband picked out a piece of new napery to cover up our old table. It looks beautiful. Though my bedroom has no sunshine it has a wall made of wood. It looks nice. I touch the wall up by picking up some posters and putting them on the wall. I really like this wood wall. But at the same time I need watch out for the fireplace. Every time I leave my apartment I look the fireplace over 2 times. I should feel embarrassed because my bedroom always in a mess. I should throw away some good for nothing to straight my bedroom up. Also I should hang up my clothes when I take them off. I used to throw them on the blanket optionally. I will try them out.
