My house is a studio. The door is in the left hand corner. When you walk in the door you notice is the kitchen. The window is on the back wall. It is a big window. So I can enjoy beautiful outside. My bathroom is located between the kitchen and the window. There is a door that connects kitchen and bathroom. It is very comfortable. There are two drawers under the window. The closet is next to the windows in the right corner. My bed is a front of the closet. My house is tiny but this is first own my one. It is a meaningful space for me.
