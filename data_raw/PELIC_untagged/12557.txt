I often write misspellings and I hardly notice them for myself as well as my friends who went to a same junior high school in Japan. Nike which is the sport goods brand became a big boom when I was a junior high school student. Everyone had some Nike goods such as bags shoes and clothes. One of my friends who talked to me very often wanted his belongings to be Nike. He showed to me them which had been written Nike by himself. However I saw the name of Mike on them. He must confuse the spell between Nike and Mike. I understood why he confused so because we were familiar the spell of Mike that always showed up our English text book. I wondered whether I must modify his misspelling now or not as seeing his full of small face. I told him the truth which he had done wrong because I wanted to prevent his shame that he would get after he demonstrated them for another classmates. At the moment when I said to him that his belongings had became Mike's he seemed feel embarrassed. I felt sorry for him and but it would be much better than he knew the right spell later. The Nike boom passed soon but I've remembered his misspelling for a while. I think I'll never misspell between Mike and Nike.
