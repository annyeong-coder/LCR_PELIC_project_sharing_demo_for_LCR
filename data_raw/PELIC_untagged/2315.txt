When I was a high school student I didn't study hard. I just liked to play with my friends so I sometimes skipped classes and went out with them. If tests were coming I didn't care about the tests. As a result my scores were low. I didn't think I would regret not studying. I should have studied at that time and I shouldn't have skipped classes. I could have studied with my friends instead of playing.
