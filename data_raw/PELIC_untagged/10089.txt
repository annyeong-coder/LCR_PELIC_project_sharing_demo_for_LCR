I have a lot of bad experiences with money. The worst one I have ever had with money was in August when I came here the first time. I had to rent a house and I had to buy some furniture. I thought I did not have to go to the furniture stores I could get them online. After I had a little research about shopping online I decided that eBay was the best and the most safety internet site. Only you had to give some information about yourself and acquaint them about your credit card's number. On your online shopping you buy your stuff from someone else. You can only meet them with internet so you should be careful. Make sure to meet honest a person. Do not do like me. After I sign it up I got some furniture and a few utensils on eBay. I spent really good deal of money. I recently followed site for sales. One day in October when the album 'Apologize' by Timberland came out I bought it on eBay too. Apparently it wasn't a good seller because I spent 40 on it and never got it. So I took the liberty of buying something else from the same guy and spent 50 on it was an expensive hair dryer and never got that either. So I sent a complaint mail to him and he never replied so I got his account deleted by letting eBay be aware of the situation I got my money back and the CD just a week later. . . . Now I prefer to shop at real stores anymore not online
