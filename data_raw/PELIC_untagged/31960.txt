See waves of the sea umbrella folded chair people d rd some fantastic music. My friends and I touched sands and we built castles. We played volleyball after we swam. We tasted the salty water. We got tired and we felt hungry so we took the dinner which was spicy taste. We feel happy. After a while I felt the strong wind at evening so I went back to the hotel. I hope to visit it again.
