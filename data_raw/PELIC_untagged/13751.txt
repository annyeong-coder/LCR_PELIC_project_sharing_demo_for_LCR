Every country has developed universities based on social economic and traditional needs. Externally universities in the world would have similar systems. However a comparison of universities in Taiwan and the USA show couple of similarities and some differences. First of all the most important thing is education and study. Universities always study to make creative and practical things. In America many companies support financial help to universities and universities give good ideas to companies. For example in Silicon Valley. In Taiwan many companies assist university's research institute. On the other hand it is very difficult to enter university in Taiwan so high school students have to study very hard. However if they pass an entrance exam it is easy to graduate from a university. However in America it is very easy to enter university in general but it is difficult to graduate from a university. In Taiwan professor give generous grades to students so students pointed out that these grades were meaningless. However in America professors evaluate student's abilities absolutely. In conclusion in Taiwan we should be a little more open minded to take opening mind and in America it's better to think and say freely but it's necessary to act courteously. We know that we have some problems about education so we try to keep up with distinguished universities in the world and research good educational system. When we feel we have problems we deal with them flexibly. That's a strong point.
