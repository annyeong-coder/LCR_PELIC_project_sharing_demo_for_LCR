My room has 1 living room and 2 bed rooms. Each bedroom has a washroom so I can go washroom whenever I want. But it is bother for me to straighten up 2 washroom. I think I want to throw 1 toilet bowl sometimes. I want to washroom to be the place where cheer me up so I decided to put up the poster of sunrise. In the living roon I put up the map of Pittsburgh because I am a starnager here. When I go to somewhere that I have never gone I find out the place on the map. I want to pick out the blind and put up new curtains. There are some place that has to touch up.
