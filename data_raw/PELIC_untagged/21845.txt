OK. The worst meal experience that I have had was in the Atlanta Airport. Few months ago the first time I came to Pittsburgh I decided to have lunched there. The menu was composed of many different dishes with ambiguous meaning. A showy dish stole my attention Chicken HOONY . I have to admit that I don't remember the exact name. It consisted of great many breast chicken pieces recovered by several spices and so much sauce. My major surprise came when I felt plenty of spicy flavor. I was disappointed. It was all my lunch. Unfortunately I had to go to the place that I was trying to avoid. . . Mc Donalds!!!.
