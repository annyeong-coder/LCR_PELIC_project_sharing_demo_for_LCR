On January 1 2012 I created a time capsule. I put it under my bed. The capsule contains 5 items. Each item tells some thing about my life. For example I put my diary to show how my life was. Also I put a few coins and a little of old money. Because it is favorite hobby. Then I put some personal papers and several books to keep them. Also I put some jewelry because it was a gift from my grand mother. Finally I put some toys because it was my toys when I was childhood.
