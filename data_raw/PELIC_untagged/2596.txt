Before I came to Pittsburgh I had been living in Santa ANON_NAME_0. By the time the Steelers won the Superbowl I had just come back from an exchange trip to my hometown. In Germany I had been going to school every day for six months. By January 2006 I had gone to 6 different countries from Europe and visited more than 20 cities. After I came back my old routine was waiting for me. By April I already had had more than 6 big tests. Before my spring break I had been studying hard every day even weekends. However my one month spring break was very relaxing and by time it was over I had spent all the free time I'd lost for small trips or just hanging outs.
