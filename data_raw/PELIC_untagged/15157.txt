My room is a comfortable room for me. I live at North Craig Street my room is a studio room. When you walk in the door the first thing you can see is a large windows on the back wall. On the left of the wall I have a sofa bed it is very comfortable. Under the windows I have a bed it is very big. The right of the wall I have a TV . Next to TV I have a big desk. I always do my homework and check my e mails on this desk. I very love my room.
