I met my friend Won suk When I was in high school. He was in class room while I was playing basket ball in a play ground. He who saw that I play basketball suggested playing basketball with him. I surprised at his suggestion because I had naver seen him. But we played basketball together. The more we played together The More friendly we were. Now He is one of my best friends.
