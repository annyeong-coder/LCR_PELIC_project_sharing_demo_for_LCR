When I was six years old my family moved from Valparaiso to La Serena which is a city located in the north of Chile. In La Serena I found a new school and new friends I still remember my first days in there I was so depressed because in Valparaiso I had left to Fido who was my little dog. However after two month my dog was with my in La Serena. I also remember a friend whose name is Gonzalo I met him because he is son of my mother's friend. That time was hard to me because all my life changed but after La Serena became to my hometown where I lived the best years of my childhood. When I finished the high school I moved to Santiago which is the capital of my country. It happened when my younger brother whose name is Nicolas was fourteen years old.
