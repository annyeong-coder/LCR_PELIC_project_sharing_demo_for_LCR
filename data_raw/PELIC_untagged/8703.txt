The Urban and Rural Divide in Saudi Arabia There are a lot of differences between the urban life and the rural life in my country. One of these differences is a sense of community. People in the urban life aren't communicating with the each other well. They are very busy so that they don't have a lot of time to visit their relatives or their friends. Because of this you will find the relationships in the urban's community are weak and as a result of that a sense of community doesn't exist. On the other hand life in a small town gives people a good chance to communicate because it's smaller and you'll run into the same people over and over. That's a good thing because it means the people you see at the grocery store or the football game are neighbors not strangers. So that they love each other and worry for their community. In conclusion people in the rural life have a good sense of community more than people in the urban life in terms of simplicity of communication.
