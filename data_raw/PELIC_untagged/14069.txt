When I was young I liked to solve math question. It does not have meaning I just liked so sometimes I entered the math contest and I got a lot of prizes. For soving math quiez I need creativity. If teacher or parents wanted to control my study I may not enjoy soving math becuase I may think that soving math question is work but they just supported me. Therefore I could enjoy study math. In my experience support helps that children create something.
