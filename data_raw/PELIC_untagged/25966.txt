I want to talk about one of my friend's cousin his name is Maher he is twenty seven years old working on the finance on the saudi arabian air lines. His problem is hearing he can't hear any thing . In the age of four he lost hearing before that time he could hear the loud voices only but now he can't. He can drive his car every day from home to work easily. He can read and understand all the arabic and the english word. But he can't talk as well but hardly understanding him when he calls his father and mother names.
