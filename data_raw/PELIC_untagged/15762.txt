I am a moody person with different aspects to my personality so my feelings end up changing frequently. By thinking about funny things I can cheer myself up quickly. When I am at home I usually pick out comedies to watch on the television because I like movies that turn out happily. Being in crowded places can bring on feeling nervous and shy and then I can run out of things to say and start laughing. Listening to music can also change my feeling and so I have to turn off the music from horror movies because I feel scared. And sometimes when my mother and I talk over past times in Turkey I try to turn my mood around to a positive one. It is not that hard for me to feel happy as long as I can address positivity around me
