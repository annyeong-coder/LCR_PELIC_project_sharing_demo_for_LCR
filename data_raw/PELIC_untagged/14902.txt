I usually go to ski resort on the weekend. But in this weekend I am going to change my schedule. First I am going to go to shopping mall. I need a clothes for winter. When I came here I hadn't known how much cold here is. In the result I didn't afford winter jacket. Next I am going to clean my house. Actually I have never cleaned my house since I moved here. Now my house is mess. When I lived in my country a maid has cleaned my house however I have to clean the house by my self from now. Last I am going to go to Japanese Restaurant Kiku where is located in Station Square. I like Japanese food especially a Sushi. Last Sunday I went there. I have enjoyed the Sushi and several fried foods. I hope this weekend will be also wonderful holiday and will be able to do three things I have planed.
