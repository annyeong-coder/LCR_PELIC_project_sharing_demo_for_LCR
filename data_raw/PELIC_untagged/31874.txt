I would take the class but I could not stay in long term. If I have to say how long I could take roughly the maximum is one month. When I took too long in there I would be too difficult to jump out off there. The reason is I had this kind of experiences before. I had gone a tempo and I felt serenity in there. The environment as far as I know there is totally out of the world. I didn't feel competitive from outside and even I didn't spot on time. Not necessary to say take any technical gadgets with me. However I can't totally absorb in this situation because I am young I have to do something. Also my parents spent how many time and how much money to take care me. I have to treat them back as how they treated me as when I was growing up. This is crucially from individual perspective.
