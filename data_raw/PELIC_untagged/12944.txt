This chapter talks about brand stretching which means advertising non tobacco products and services named after their brand. All american leading tobacco companies sponsor different activities around the world such as tv shows radio programs they make clothes with tobacco name brands or different musical events even some sport tournaments. In none above mentioned activities the cigarettes are mentioned but they are all named after tobacco brands and they carry their logos. Anyone who sees these things will automatically think about cigarettes although it is not the discussion. This is another prosperous way of advertising their product.
