If I have received a gift of money I will like to buy tickets to an event that I really want to attend. Why I would like to buy tickets to an event. Because I believe if that money enough to buy a piece of jewelry I like I can use money to buy many tickets to an event I really want to attend. While I buy many tickets I can invite my good friends and family to attend that event. Because of joining a fun event with close people it is treasure than others constant for me. Fro example when I was child one time two of my sisters and I got sick together. My father told us if you recovered soon then he could either buy gifts for us that we like or he could take all family members to see the music show that we really want to attend. My sisters and I chose to see the music performance that we real want to see it before. All of us were so happy and we forget we were so sick before. And then another day my family buy gifts for my sister and me to thank us to give him a great time. So I think if I don't have enough time to buy something I want such as buying a piece of jewelry I like or tickets to an event I really want to attend at the same time. I will like to choose something that I can share with someone I love not only to get something I want it. I believe when I share my treasure with some people I can make more propel happy. Maybe after that I can get some surprise too. In the other hand buying a piece of jewelry I can do whenever I want it when I have extra money. In conclude how nice if I can receive a gift of money that I can share my gift to others to make all of us happy.
