Two years ago I and my friends went to Bahrain to spend the weekend. We should have traveled with my car for that we asked ANON_NAME_0 for his car. For the whole trip they blamed me and they said I should have fixed my car before the trip. I told them that I ought to have sent it to the maintenance and it should have been finished but they did not response at all. I might have made them upset but they could have forgiven me because it was out of my hands. When we arrived to Bahrain we should've booked for a five star hotel but unfortunately it was only three stars. I told my friends we should not have thought about these small issues we could've enjoyed our time. After spending a wonderful weekend we returned back to Riyadh and I apologized for my mistake
