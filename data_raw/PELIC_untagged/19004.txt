If I were very rich I will live in my country. Because of many reasons I can establish my own environment and get all facilities. Moreover it is the best place live happily and peacefully because I am well known about the different parts of my country. Communicating with my people is much easier than any other parts of the world. Because of wealth plays indirect role in different kinds of people having enough money will help me to live in a nice area around nice people. Finally money is the nerve of life and my country is my origin so if I can have them both I will be very lucky.
