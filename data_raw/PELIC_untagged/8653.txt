Actually I made a big decision when I finished my high school. I decided to go to military service first and then came to America. If I hadn't gone to military I would still be studying in Taiwan. If I hadn't gone to military I wouldn't have chance to come here. I think come here to meet international friends is good for me. If I'm studying in Taiwan I can't meet international friends. English is important but I'm too lazy to do my work. So if I study I will improve my grades a lot. My grades are so bad now. I hope I will improve my grades.
