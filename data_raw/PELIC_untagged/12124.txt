I have been fascinated the American Football. However by the time I moved to America in 2007 on April I hadn't known The NFL at all. First of all when I came here I couldn't speak English at all. Therefore I didn't go anywhere alone. Several weeks later my husband provided me the American football's players' cards which were 400 pieces and told me that this is the most famous sport in America I should read them whenever I stay in room alone. He was worried that I would get depression if I didn't do anything and held in room all day. Then I had been reading them for last year. I've memorized their names positions and accomplishments. Of course I studied its rule and I knew that The NFL is the only organization to have the good balance amount. After the season began I watched almost every games. The games were magnificent there ware miracles each games. Finally I've understood the reason for why it is the most famous sport in America and they're capable of earning enormous money. As for me The American football has become a significant item to live here.
