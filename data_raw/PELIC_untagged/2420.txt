The members of my family include my parents and 5 siblings who I have loved a lot since I born. My parents teach as not only by speech but also but actions. They didn't have higher education and they nurtured us not education but also personality during we are children. Such as they always told us it is worth to help someone than someone to help you . So all of us love to help someone and we think it is our pleasure to do that. Thus all of us always feel happy to live. Then most people love boys than girls in Chinese society but my parents teach all our siblings in equity. So they didn't do any special to my brother. For example usually no one wants to pay a lot of money for girl to study at abroad because they think when girl gets marry she belongs others family. But my parent let our girls to study abroad and pay all spending we need for us. Moreover I love all my siblings a lot. Since I was child I have a bad body condition. All my siblings were taking a care a lot of me and didn't ask me to do any hard work. I am not youngest at my family but everyone treat me just like I am their little sister. Especial when I was a student all of them were working they always give me a lot of money. Now most of them get married and I am here Even if they can't support me money we still have good relationship to each other. So why I love my all members of family because I know they treat me without any pay back.
