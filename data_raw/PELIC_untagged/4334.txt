One of my favorite's restaurants is Pizza. Here's pizza is different another pizza hut so that I like it. My grandmother take me go to eat once time in Squirrel hill. I hope we can go to eat again. In addition RED ROBIN in the waterfront is delicious too. We ate big hamburger and French fries and coke. Then you can order French fries and coke again is free. Therefore I like it.
