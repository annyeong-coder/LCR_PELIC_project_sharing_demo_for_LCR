My major is law I have a dream from many years ago that is become a famous lawer. I know it's very hard. If you want to study law you only can start to study law as a major after graduated from colleage. As you know the frist challenge is when you graduated from law school you are not a young guy. Will you spend so many year to wait for you dream job The second challenge is because it's spend more than 4 years so you will spend more money than other college student. Will your parents support you If all of your answer is yes you may start to imagine one day you become a brilliant lawer but you it's not all what you need. You should study a lot about law and any kind of case because lawer will face many kind of situation and case. Then you need have a calm mind and a clear headed. I don't recommend people who dosen't have endurance to study law. It is a complex work .
