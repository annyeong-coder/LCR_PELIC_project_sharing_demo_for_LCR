In my opinion being honest is a valuable advice. If I am honest with someone but he can't do in the same way as me he will not be suitable for me. I dislike anyone who doesn't tell the truth the most. In the other hand the advice that is not valuable for me is giving more chance. I don't want to make relationship with whom I don't like or feel bad at first time.
