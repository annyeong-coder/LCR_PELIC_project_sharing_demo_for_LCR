When I was a freshman I studied in English Literature class. At that time my teacher usually gave homework such as 'Writing an Essay in English'. 'Writing an Article of Book in English' and 'Writing a diary in English. ' To students. Whenever teacher returned my homework I felt confused about that. Because there are many 'check mark' in red pen and most of them were ' ' mark. It means teacher said I don't understand what are you saying. It's very Korean expression. So you have to change those things in English Expression. . How difficulty it is! But today I have same problems about writing in English. I don't know correct idiomatic phrase in English and it getting worse when I try to write something. There are many idea in my head but it's very hard to write in English. So that's my weakness as a writer in English. On the other hand I have a strength thing about writing in English. First of all I have been writing almost 18 years. I wrote my diary since I was 6years old. And I'm always enjoying my writing so whenever I'm writing even though it's homework or some kinds of tests I can write quite happy. That's very helpful as you know positive mind always helps to do something. And my inclination like to writing something is my strength as a writer in English I think.
