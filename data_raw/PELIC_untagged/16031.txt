I think it is important to practicing a sport so you can conserve your body from weakness and get enough staying power. If you have some exercises per week three times around one hour you get pretty fit. However the exercises should not be too much because you could strain your body. Also you have to prioritize your time. If you have a full time job you are getting more exhausted with too much exercises. Only athletes must practice their sport for several hours a day. This is of vital importance for their career.
