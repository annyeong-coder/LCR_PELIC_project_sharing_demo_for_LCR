I look my apartment over to find out something relate to Feng Shui. I pick up a book at library but I can't figure out what I have to do. I call my friend up in order to help me out. He tells me that he will work my problem out. At first we have an appointment but he asks me to put it off until next week. When he checks my apartment out he clear me up. My apartment is good in Feng Shui but have to clean it up. I feel good and go on living in this apartment.
