In the University of Pittsburgh at the Cathedral of Learning there are many rooms which have the qualities of specific countries. These rooms reflect the culture and custom of its country. Among the rooms we visited two interesting rooms the early American room and the Syria Lebanon room. They have a lot of differences and some similarities. The most obvious difference is these rooms are the decoration. The ceiling floor and chairs. In the early American room we can see that the ceiling of the kitchen living room is of heavy pine beams handout it is very simple and it is not high the bed room usually is on top of it. On the other hand we have a much decorated ceiling in the Syria Lebanon room. It is high and it is full of colors and carving that reflects the time of that room and how much Arabs love decorating their rooms. Both rooms represent wealthy families' houses. The floor in the Syria Lebanon room is white marble and it has fascinating small pieces of red marbles that are shaped in an Islamic design. Unlike that room the early American room has a wood floor which is not available in all houses the wood is expensive that's way it was founded in the rich peoples houses. In the two rooms we saw chairs but the chairs in the early American room there was a long table and two benches whereas in the Syria Lebanon room it has a very nice sofas that are built in that surround the room. These striped red and white satin sofas are attractive. They look very elegant. There is a large amount of differences between the two rooms beside the ceiling floor and chairs. These are just two rooms in the middle of many rooms which are small symbols of there countries in the Cathedral of Learning in Pittsburgh.
