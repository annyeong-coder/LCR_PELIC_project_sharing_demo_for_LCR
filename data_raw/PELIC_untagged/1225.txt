It's really a strange thing. But I think there was an airplane which might have carried a lot of fish on it. This airplane might have carried these fish to somewhere. Unfortunately the lock could have opened by an unknown reason and the fish was falling. In order to deliver the fish could have frozen thus why they were fresh when they were falling.
