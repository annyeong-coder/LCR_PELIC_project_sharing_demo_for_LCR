My name is Michelle. I've been lived at North Shore in Pittsburgh for 3 month but I just moved to Squirrel hill last month. I've been studying English for 10 years before I came to Pitts. I've been to America several time for traveling. I've been preparing the TOEFL since May. I'll take the exam on November.
