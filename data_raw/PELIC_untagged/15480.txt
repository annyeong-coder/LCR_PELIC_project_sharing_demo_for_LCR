A place where is always in my mind is my primary school . There were a small school where was sorrouded by many lively trees and colorful flowers. Everyone who had seen the school tell me it was such a wonderful school! I would defintely like it! It was not true. However beautiful it was I still disliked going to the school. However no matter how much I cried my father push me to school. At about that time I was a student who was so quiet and isolated. To be honest I did not have any friend whom I could speak to or play with . Then Mariam who was my teacher came to my life . She taght me much more than any student in class . Moreover she spent her time when she finished her teaching everyevening talking to me. For 3 months she did change me totally. I finally became more socialable and talkative. My parents and I appreciated her so much. We always visited her at the school every New Year day. Last 3 days I heard she passed away with severe cancer. I felt totally shocked . I could not have an opportunity to attend her funeral in Thailand. However from my memorable Mariam is the person who is the first teacher and also the first friend of mine. I will keep her and our memory in the school in my mind forever.
