Visiting Brazil has been my dream vacation since I was a child. I am interested in all things which are relevant to the environment on the earth. Every time when I hear some news about it I always listen carefully and try to find further information from other media. Since having bred two parrots I am eager to visit their hometown Brazil. In Brazil there is the biggest tropical rainforest. A variety of creatures have been living there. I hope I would see all of them. In reality it is impossible. Moreover I am also fascinated to its festivals especially Carnaval. I have been planning to visit Brazil for a long time. If everything is on schedule I am going to be on the beach in Rio on February 15th 2008. In other words I will have some shinny days in next cold winter. I am going to be sitting on a chair and watching the sea with beautiful sunshine at that time. After participating in the crazy and colorful festival I am going to go into the Amazon. I hope I could be surrounded by many animals when I am in the forest. Additionally I could see many kinds of parrot such as macows and conurs because I have found a tour for visiting the habitat for parrots. Finally if there is a chance to have a fisherman to find the biggest fish Arapaima. That will be a great ending of the vacation.
