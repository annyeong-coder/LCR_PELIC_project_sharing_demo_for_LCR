The flow is the state in which total absorption can engender peak pleasure and creativity. It is more comfortable for children than adults. The time doesn't matter in this state because there is only the timeless moment at hand. I had experienced flow many times when I was a child especially when I was painting. I was creating many things in my paints with careless of the time and I was stay late drawing some paintings. I think should be organized to create flow because students need to have the opportunities to explore their talents.
