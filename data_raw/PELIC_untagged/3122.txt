I'll buy a piece of jewelry. Because a piece of jewelry is exist I can see it and I can touch it. But an event is not real. If once an event is finished I can't see it anymore. Of course I would enjoy the event but it's only possible at that time. I can't control the situation. I wouldn't pay for this invisible unmanageable feeling of enjoy. In addition we can't remember every moment. That is the reason why most famous events are re played. Many people are very accustomed about attending the same event over and over again. It's waste of time and money. Besides an event we can't predict the entire event. It can be whether very boring or very unacceptable. Even so I can't get your money back. I just spent my money for nothing. However if I paid for the jewelry it's my investment. If I have a piece of jewelry I still have a same amount of money. It's very useful change. I can use a piece of jewelry as an asset. My piece of jewelry is not going away. Even I can resell to the other person. If I have to choose one thing I will choose a piece of jewelry
