My Study Habit People have unique writing habits. Some people listen to music when they study. Others prefer being guiet than listening to music. Also I have my own writing habits. I usually study at the desk in the library. There are a lot of students who study hard in the library. I feel competitive and it helps me to get motivation. In addition I drink coffee and eat sweet cookies during writing an essay. It makes me more comfortable. Furthermore I don't like listening to music when I study. I cannot focus on my topic and I think about other things when I listen to music. Lastly I write essays late at night. I want that I get up early and I study in the morning. However I usually go to bed after midnight. Therefore I cannot get up early. This is why I study late at night.
