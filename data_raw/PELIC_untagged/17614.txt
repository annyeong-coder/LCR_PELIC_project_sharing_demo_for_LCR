What is memorable is that I lost my weight in 2007. I was 90Kg 198lb which is very heavy. I had tried to lose my weight by 2007 which was not successful. Therefore I had to decided seriously what I should do to lose my heavy weight. I avoided eating food that has much fat and carbohydrate. It was so hard to stand not eating almost anything at night because I jogged for 1 hour every day. What was the most difficult thing was that I didn't recognize how much weight I had lost. The process that lose weight is very slow and needs long time. But I didn't give up. I just kept jogging and avoiding eating something which has bad ingredients. However I had a few problems when I wan invited to a party. What people didn't like about me was that I didn't drink alcohol. It is often important to drink alcohol with superiors in a company. So I needed to explain what I had been doing and they understood what and why I decided. Finally I have lost 20Kg 45lb . Now my weight is approximately 70Kg 154lb . What is the most successful is that I have totally different body shape. Now What I have to do is that I have to keep what I have done such as avoiding eating bad food working out frequently.
