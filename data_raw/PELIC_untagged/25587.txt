I feel my bedroom has large space and bright. The room can cheer me up when I come back after school. But the desk lamp is not enought bright and the mattress is not comfortable. I will pick up more bright lamp to light up the room and pick up a new comfortable mattress to make a replacement. Moreover I need to clean up my room and it will looks neat. I believe it is worth trying out.
