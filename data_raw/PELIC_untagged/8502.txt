When I came to American. I needed to find out an apartment for rent and made an appointment with house company to look over a status of the apartment. In my home a bit of music sometimes could cheer me up. Meanwhile I like to hang up some pictures on the wall to make me feel comfortable. Besides I took down the blinds in the living room and replace them with bright color curtains. I also want to take away a big bookcase to light the room up. Straighten up books on my desk would make me feel good. When I go outside I will turn off all electric equipment and look over gas stove be closed or not.
