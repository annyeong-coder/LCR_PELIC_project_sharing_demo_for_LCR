In my opinion a friend is a person who knows you well and likes you anyway. I have a lot of friends whose relationships with me may be less deep. For example my best friend whose name is Walled is very close to me and cares about me much. We are similar at many things. In fact there are a lot of people who can make frienship with any person easly and quickly but I cann't. I have to know the person who could be my friend well befor making any relationship with him and decide if he has any common things with me or not. Today a close friend can be someone that keeps you away from danger and provides you the advice.
