When I lived in Seoul I have had a telemarketing call. A telemarketer wanted to talk me into buying a year long magazine subscription and kept on asking me although I already rejected the offer once. But I was not interested in signing up for any magazine subscription. I turned down her proposal again and wanted to hang the phone up immediately. Eventually the telemarketer agreed to give me some time to think over the plan and then I said that I would call her back soon.
