There are many traditional holidays in Taiwan. We have to do special things for these days. My favorite one is the Chinese New Year Eve because it is the most important reunion for Chinese. Before the dinner starts everyone of the family should come back home with our parents and grandparents. Sometimes all of us eat out. Usually we eat at home and prepare a variety of food. After dinner children go outside and set off fireworks. The adults either talk with each other or play porker or mah jong for gambling but do not use a lot of money because the game is just for fun. At night we stay up until passing midnight because we ought to awake to welcome our next year in Chinese tradition.
