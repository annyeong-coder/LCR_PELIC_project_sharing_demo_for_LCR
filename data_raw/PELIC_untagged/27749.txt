HEALTH CARE ISSUE As many countries Libya is one of these countries having health care issues and problems. For long time the health care in Libya has become worse and worse. The health care quality drop because of many issues low financial support from the government and male organization by health care institutions. As a result this is affect on people trust toward lost the health care system in Libya. The financial support that hospitals are receiving from the government still not enough to improve the health care to buy good equipment for better diagnosis or to give good income to the doctors. Even though the health care is free in Libya the hospitals are still not able to give the proper health care for their patient. From many doctors perspective putting unqualified and bad leader to control the health organization are the main cause of health care failure. Most the health organization did not have good planning to improve health care due to the people who works and control the health system are not qualified or just work to steal money. They didn't care so much to do that is best for the health care they care just how they can get money from their position as leader. As a result of all these causes many people loss their trust in health system. Because they didn't get the proper health care even though it's free but they prefer to go to the private clinics to get the proper care they deserve. Also due to the low income for the doctors most the expert doctors start working in private clinic therefore most of the people go to private clinics. Even though we have high educated people and smart doctors this is not enough to improve health care. We need to do a big move from everyone mainly the government to have good health system and gain people trust again. Sometimes I prefer to pay for health insurance to get good care instead of free health care giving nothing.
