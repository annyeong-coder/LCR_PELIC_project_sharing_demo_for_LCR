When it is required to give some feedback to others I will consider whether my feedback motivates them to do something positive. According to the cycle of motivation positive feedback is very important to others in that it can cause positive results. For example praise can lead to confidence confidence can lead to high standards and high standards can lead to strong result. On the other hand negative feedback can demotivate others. Therefore I will try to give positive and helpful feedback to others.
