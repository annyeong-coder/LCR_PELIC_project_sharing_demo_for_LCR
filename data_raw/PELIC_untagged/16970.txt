Before I went to high school I thought a student was an easiest job. Actually a student is not a job but I thought a student was a kind of job at that time. After getting a real job working in a company my thought changed. I realized living as a student also has difficult things and gets a lot of pressure like a worker. Especially it is too hard to stand pressure from test homework and relationship. Most students can't be free from the test. Teachers want to know how much the students understand and know the classes. So teachers evaluate the students by the test. Also the students try to get high score because they believe getting high score leads good job after school. The homework gives the students the pressure too. They know the homework help their studies. Moreover they realize the homework is a kind of evaluating them so they do the homework best as if they take a test. Those are nothing to give up dating or sleeping in order to complete the homework. The most thing is the relationship with friends. The friends are a good advisers and teachers. The students give and take resource each other. As a result they teach each other through these procedures. So the students look for good friends who give advantage or benefit. But it is not easy because most students want to defend on another student. The students are not a machine to study but they keep studying is their duty in mind. Although most students look happy in fact every student has gotten the pressure from the test the homework and the relationship.
