The Swedish movie Let the light one in which is revived in an English version 'Let me in' is one of my favorate movies. The heroine of the movie is a little girl whose face is very pale. She is a friend of a boy who nobody likes to hang out with. They meet at night and become friends for each other. But the boy notices that some people all of whom were taken blood were murdered and his only friend might be the culprit. But their friendship or love doesn't change. The reason I like this movie is that I can see the freezing and beautiful scenes in the movie. The movie breaks the stereotype of typical vampire movies where vampires are usually attractive men who suck beautiful women's blood.
