Iknew him as along time and he was very important person to me and he still close friend. I was studying in the first term undergraduate school in our capital city when I met him. He was from my city but I didn't know him before. My friend and I were usually planning to spend our vacation together. When we meet each other we were talking about the old days. He is very nice guy because he was honest person. I respect him and I hope to be friends forever.
