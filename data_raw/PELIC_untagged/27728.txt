After I had finished my grammar class I had signed up for the soccer game. I gave them my number and they told me that they would call. After two days they had called me back to inform me about the time and the place where the game will take place. Unfortunately I didn't understood nothing. So I told them that I have to hang up and I would call them back. So I had called them back but they didn't answer. So I had given up.
