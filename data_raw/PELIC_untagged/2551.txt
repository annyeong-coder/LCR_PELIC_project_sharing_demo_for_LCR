Before I came to Pittsburgh I'd never ridden a bus myself. By the time I entered the E. L. I. I'd learned some necessary place's addresses. I also had been visiting Niagara Falls for a week. I'd been writing my memoir until I started studying English. I'd never had a lot of busy time before that. I'd just been thinking I'll have a fun. In fact I'd expected to find extra time to read the paper of researches that I have to. However I hadn't considered studying two things at the same time will concern me a lot.
