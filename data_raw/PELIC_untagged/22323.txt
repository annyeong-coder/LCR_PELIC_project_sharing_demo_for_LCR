I was born at Anayang Korea. I spent most childhood at Gwacheon near to Seoul. I graduated primary middle highschool at Gwacheon. I've played a bass guitar since when I entered highschool. I like active sports. My father and I have often enjoyed pingpong. Also I've been skiing every year since 2005. I've wanted to live in the State and I'm living in Pittsburgh now!
