Some people said that friends are the people who have the same personality and interests. I agree with the same interests but I do not agree with the same personality. Because my friend Rita is a person who is mostly different from me. She is an out going person and I am shy. She is a person who will seldom think about the consequence once she did something but I do. When we were in high school she joined a dance club which had a lot of chances to perform in front of people. I cannot do that unless there is at least six person with me. She also likes to have parties so that she can meet many different people at the same time. At the party she can talk to those people who she just met and feel like they known each other for a long time. And almost every time after the party she can keep in touch with them. But for me although I like parties I cannot make friends so easily and quickly. I'd prefer to get to know someone slowly. Another thing she likes to do is to try new things which are interesting and challenging. She got a tattoo last year and she said that it has a meaning for her. But I think if her mother see it she will get in troubles. I will never ever try to get a tattoo on my skin it is too risky. Once you get it it is forever. Although sometimes she did some silly things that made me feel she is a headless person just like a child she will always be my best friend. And we still keep in touch now.
