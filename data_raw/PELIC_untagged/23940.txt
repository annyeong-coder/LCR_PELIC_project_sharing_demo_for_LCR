Hellen Fisher said that the main characteristic of romantic love is carving and the other main characteristic is motorvation. Before the research that she did she thougt that love is emotional but after the research she realized love is not emotional it si a drive and it comes from our the carving of the mind. She ended up her speech by expressing her worried which was Depression drug. Especially in the U. S. A usage of the depression drugs increase day by day. These drugs affects brains as a result these drugs kill love and orgasm.
