Six month ago I met friend of mine by coincidence at the Hookah Bar. He was sitting with three friends of him. I sit with them and we enjoyed our time. The time went very fast and it's 1 am and it's too late so I have to leave. Before I left them my friend called me ANON_NAME_0 I said yes and he said you should have given me your number before you leave I said uh I'm sorry I forgot here it is my number . Two weeks later he called me and invited me for a birthday party and he said you must come to celebrate with us then I said OK I will do. It was my first time that I invited to a party in U. S. Actually I don't know the customs in U. S. A. But I said I must take something as a gift for him then I said I have got to take a cake. When I came over to him in his place I gave him the cake and he really thanked me and I was happy because he enjoyed it. While we cut the cake we remembered the small candles. I apologized for my friend and I said sorry I should have brought with me but he said no don't worry it's my fault I should have had them . I was really happy to celebrate with him and I told hem that you are supposed to come over to hangout on my place.
