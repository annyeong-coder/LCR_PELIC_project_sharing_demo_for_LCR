My hometown is Daegu that is the fourth largest city in South Korea after Seoul Busan and Incheon. Daegu's climate is very humid and subtropical. The mountains that comprise the basin trap hot and humid air. Similarly in winter cold air lies in the basin. Daegu is the core of an industrial area which accounted for 94 percent of Korea's trade surplus in 2006. Daegu has a lot of celebrities who are representative for Korea. Former president Rho Tae woo Samsung Group former chairman ANON_NAME_0 Kun hee and actress Son Ye jin were all born in Daegu.
