To important areas of my life are my family and my wife. If I hadn't been born my sister would have been happy. If I hadn't been born my sister would have been only child so my parents would have brought her up more carefully. She must have gotten a lot of presents from my parents and she would not have a quarrel between brothers. The other part of my life is my wife. If I hadn't been born my wife would have gotten married to other man. If she hadn't gotten married with me she might have been happier. I do not have much money. If she had gotten married to rich man she would have been happier.
