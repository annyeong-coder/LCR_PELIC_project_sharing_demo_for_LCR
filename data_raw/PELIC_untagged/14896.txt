First in Friday night I always go to the movie or restaurant. The Saturday morning I will go to the GYM for one hour. Next I will do my homework then I will wait for the match's Steelers. In the night I will chat with all friends from Africa and sleeping. The Sunday I will wake up at 12 pm take bath and read something like books. Finally In afternoon I will prepare all lot schedules for Monday.
