I'm getting ready for the party tonight with my friends. I've already cooked our dinner but I haven't washed the dishes yet. I've already mode Arabic tee but I haven't mode Arabic coffee yet. My friend ANON_NAME_0 is helping me. He has already bought juices but he hasn't bought soda yet. He has already cleaned party room but he hasn't put the flowers on the tables yet. He and I have already bought gifts but we haven't wrapped the gifts yet. We have already bought balloons but we haven't hanged the balloons yet. We have already borrow enough chairs but we haven't been orderly this chairs yet.
