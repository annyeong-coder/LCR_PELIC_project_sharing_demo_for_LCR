Parents should not interfere with children's behavior over because children are independent individuals. Teachers have to teach the knowledge to children as well as the norms of conduct. However sometimes children don't understand rules until they grow up. Parents must remind them of the laws to prevent their children from facing danger or doing a crime. In addition children usually want to do some adventures which may lead them to against the law after school. Parents have their responsibility for confirming where the children go and what they do after classes. I insist on that everyone must think over their duty before they want to have a baby because teaching children is a great responsibility. People who have children must pay more attention and concern for their children's behavior even if teachers can help them. On the other hand parents are the model for their children it is important that regarding their own behavior. As the result when a child performed badly no one should be blamed more than his her parents.
