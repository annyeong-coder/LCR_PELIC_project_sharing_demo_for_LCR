This afternoon I called my friend John. He did not pick it up. 1 Hour later he called back but I was sleeping and did not wake up. He went on calling me and did not give up. Many minutes later I woke up and found my cell phone out. He told me he had to sign up more people for his company. He asked me to go over the contract then to figure out where need to enhance. I held the call on and think over every detail. Some ideas turned out and I told him. At last I hung up the call and kept on sleeping.
