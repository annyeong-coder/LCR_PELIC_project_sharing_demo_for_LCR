When I was in Korea I had never bought a car because there is a lot of transportation in Korea so I didn't necessary a car. Also I had never met a person who was born other countries. It's so hard to meet foreigner in Korea. Unfortunately I had never gotten married. Actually I really wanted to get married but I didn't any prepare to get married. So When I come back to Korea and I prepare to get married I will get married.
