My friend has traveled many areas in the world. She has been a tour guide for a few years. Many people envy her work because she can travel a lot and has a good salary. She has been to Italy twice and also has been to Japan and France many times. But she has never been to Rome. She has just returned from Japan with her families and brought a lot of gifts for her friends. She has focused on studying English for 2 years and she has contacted an American friend since 3 months ago which has improved her English. She has lived in Beijing since 2006 but she has always wants to move to Shanghai. She is an ambitious and good friend in my life.
