One person in my life influenced my to be successful in my life is my father. He is now in Saudi Arabia. He taught me many things in my life to be a successful man. For example when I was in the school he told me that you would not have been admitted to the school of engineering without studying hard. 'Had I not gotten high grades I would not have gotten admission or scholarship outside the country. ' He said. He also recommended that I learn English and communicate with the native speakers to get a good job in the future. I might learn English if not I won't be able to have a great job with a high salary. It is important that he advice me because I'm the oldest son and he want to be proud of me. With a great of working hard I will achieve what I need and what my dad needs. His advise encourage me to accomplish them.
