I am an oblivious person I am so forgetful that I always forget where I put my things. Because of this personality I have an interesting experience. Until now I still can't forget it. When I was in university I went to the supermarket very often. One day I wanted to buy a loaf of bread and a carton of milk for breakfast so I grabbed my wallet to the supermarket. I stayed in front the cold storage and chose my milk. Then I picked a loaf of bread and went toward counter. When I wanted to pay the money I found that I lost my wallet. It was not on my hand!Everybody was waiting for me impatiently. That made me really nervous. At the same time the person who was waiting behind me asked the clerk how much are her things I can pay for her. Then he paid the money for me and went inside the supermarket with me again. He tried to help me but we didn't find my wallet. I felt sorry to him and I asked his phone number so that I can give his money back. After this event we became good friends and now he's my boyfriend. So maybe this kind of personality is not really bad. Few months later I received a package from the market. I have forgotten my wallet in cold storage for 2 months!
