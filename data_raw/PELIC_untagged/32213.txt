Some people always think meeting people in a new place is a challenge so I would like to give some advice here. First before u get over your house you should check the place in Google map. Also choose a building easy to find in that time. Than u need do is be there in time. After that u should call he she after u get there and don't go too far since you told he she your location. By the way wearing a colorful cloth can make people easy to find you.
