People like to travel and there are a lo of spaces in the world to go. Although money situation one of the biggest barrier I prefer to go to United States of America and China. I would go to these two countries because they have totally different culture from my culture. In addition they have good chance to find a better future too. It is clearly seen nowadays people move to either USA or china. For example based on my personal notice I found people from my culture move to study in either each these countries. Furthermore going in their will help you to meet different people and minds. For instance these two countries are considered one of best places to find highly educated people so if someone go their he or she will discover how these people collaborate with foreigner and accept them as one part of them. Finally in my point of view I would go their even if I have a lot of obstacles like money. I would suggest these two places to go due to the previous reasons mentioned above.
