The news reported the conflict and contradiction between the teachers in Central Fall HS and the school district in Rhode Island. The school district decided to discharge the every teacher in Central Fall HS in the end of this school year because the school is the lowest performance in state. In the school there are 55 skilled in reading and 7 proficient in math and half the students are failing every subject. Two options that one was a transformation model and the other was a turnaround model were made. The transformation model which proposed that teachers had to do extra hours of work with students was failed because most of the students in the school are in poverty and most teachers have had between 72 000 and 78 000 salary and they required the compensation for the extra hours. The school district implemented the other one which was to fire the whole teachers and to rehire. The teachers showed that thought that they have been unfairly targeted and scapegoated and will fight to have them reinstate because they have made 21 rising in reading and 3 rising in math last year.
