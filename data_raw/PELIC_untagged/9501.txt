About my kitchen My kitchen has a lot of the kitchen utensils for cooking. My kitchen is a rectangle. When you walk in the kitche you can find large window on the back wall. It use to open the windows to let some fresh air in. A trash basket is under the window. The left wall is a sink. I keep a basket on the left sink with a spoon a chopstick a pork a knife and a vessel. I keep a basket on the right sink with sugar soy source and salt. An oven and a stove are on the wall to the right. A refrigerator is beside a stove. I put all food in a refrigerator. A microwave oven is on the refrigerator. It's very easy for me to cook in the kitchen bacause I have a lot of kitchen equipments.
