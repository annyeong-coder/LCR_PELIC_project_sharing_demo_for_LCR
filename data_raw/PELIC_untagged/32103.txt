Summary This speech talked about environment problem in Canada. Some wetlands that were intact had a lot of animals. Many years ago there were over 1000 species and had clean rivers however it is endangered since industry project went to exploit oil in there. Rivers are polluted by oil and people cannot eat the fish from the rivers. The biggest trucks work in the wetlands everyday and a lot of pup lines are built. As a result because the foods are polluted the cancer rates are raised and animals are dead. Garth Lens suggested that human beings should respect our planet protect global warming and survival our future's life.
