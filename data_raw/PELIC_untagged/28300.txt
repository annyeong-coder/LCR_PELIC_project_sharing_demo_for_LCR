We have lived in the same house for along time or since my big brother born because the neighborhood that we live in was very nice and or relatives were near. My parent is thinking to change the place we have lived in for long time . They have already planned for this But fortunally they haven't gotten a good deal yet so they are still looking. We have never lived in other place for long time . My grandparents lived in there house for 50 years . We visited them three time last week. My brother won his champion boxing match yesterday . We made a big party for him after he got his prize yesterday because he didn't won in the last game .
