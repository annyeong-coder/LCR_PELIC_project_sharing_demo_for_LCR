I think my apartment cheer me up because it's very clean and convenient. Every morning have people straighten all the floors up. All the floors have a place to throw garbage away. I can use phone to open the door if I want to let someone in. Actually the first time I want to pick out other floors' room but they just have rooms at second floor. I think this is the only thing tear me down.
