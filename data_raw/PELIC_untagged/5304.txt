I would like a person who looks like Abdull to share my apartment. Because he's doesn't like to listen to music every time and I don't like any sound that is loud. In addition he doesn't wach TV when I study in the living room. Abdull helps me when I need any thing from him. And he likes to clean our apartment that's important reason to me. In addition he cooks arabic food in fact he is good chef. My roommate's schedule is same my schedule that's important reason also to me. Also he like to speak with me in english in our apartment that's good practice and good activity to learning our language.
