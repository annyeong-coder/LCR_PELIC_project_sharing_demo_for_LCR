Dear Mr. ANON_NAME_0 Thank you so much for taking time from your busy schedule to give my classmates and I an excellent presentation last Friday to show us how to use the University of Pittsburgh library databases. Because of your presentation I understand how to use the PittCat and Academic Search Premier to find papers related to the information I require. My instructor asked us to write argumentative essays so I need some information to support my opinions. How to use the library databases would be very helpful for me to complete this assignment and do academic research in the future as well. Thank you again for your generous help and the explicit presentation. Sincerely Emily Last Name
