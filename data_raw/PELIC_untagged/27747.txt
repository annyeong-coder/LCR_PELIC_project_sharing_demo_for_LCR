Laws against light contamination haven't been published in my country even though it has already existed and affected our daily life for many decades. With the rapid growth of economy trend of inordinate usage of natural resource and electrical power is unavoidable . It's impossible for most of us to observe a meteor when we stand at any place in a city. What is the reason Please look at these interchanges airports universities and any tower block . It is true that people can not live without electric power. However do we really need enough light when there is few people in a street Do we really need street lamps in universities when all the students are going for a holiday The light could also affect a pilot's decision when an airplane is going to landed. Because the city is full of light all overnight many of our kids do not know how quiet and peaceful the night is when the sun is going down and moon secretly appears her face. Therefore many folk organizations launch some activities to tell people save electric power such as in a festival day all the citizens in the same community turn off light for only five minutes or the financial center of Pu Dong district turn off all the billboard's light from 11pm to 3 am . It's a good beginning for this issue but it's not enough .
