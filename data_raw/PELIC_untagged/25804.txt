In the present I always try to remember somethings I couldn't use in the past. When I was 10 year old I couldn't go any places alone but now I can. Also I couldn't wash my clothes but no I can. Furthermore I wasn't able to talk in front students in class but now I'm able to talk at any situations. Moreover I wasn't able to make charts and graph. But now I'm able to make charts and graph. In contrast I'm taking English classes now and I can write some sentences correct more than before but I don't think that I will be able to improve quickly. I challenge myself to be able to write very well.
