Yes. I enjoy trying unusual food. Because I like try new things especially new delicious food. It is not only focus on food but also express local culture. When we tasted food we also curiously talked about the specific local culture. After tasting delicious food I enjoy talk about the resource of food and people activity of different countries. I am really excited to try different food all over the world. I can have more challenge when I try to get different food.
