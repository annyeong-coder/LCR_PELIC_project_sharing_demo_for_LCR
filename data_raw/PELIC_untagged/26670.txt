I was born in Seoul which is capital city of South Korea. While I was living in Seoul I graduated elementary school. I moved to Daejon which is in the middle of Korea in 1993. I fell in love with JS when I started University. I got a job in the Fashion brand company when I graduated University. I quitted it when I decided to go abroad for improving English. I began the semester in ELI of PITT when I came to Pittsburgh.
