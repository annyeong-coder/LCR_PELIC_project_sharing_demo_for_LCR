I met my friend Cindy while I was living in Pittsburgh. We were walking while it was raining. We decided to get into the coffee shop. When we arrived at coffee shop we sat the same table. When we waited for the coffee she asked me several questions. While we were talking with each other we found a lot of same hobbies. She invited me to play basketballs When we drinking the coffee. When we decided to play basketballs we left the coffee shop. The rain stopped when we left the coffee shop.
