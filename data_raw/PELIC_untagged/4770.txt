When I was 8 th grade I met my best friend. It was first day of school. One girl sat next to me. She had really tan skin and nice teeth. We didn't really talk to each other at the first moment. We were just looking at each other. So I started to talk to her. Because I didn't want to have silence. I just picked up the random subject. While I was talking with her I found out that we have a lot of in common. I found that we all have older sisters. And we were both huge fans of the same famous singer. After that I started to hang out with her a lot. And we bacame more closer. And whenever I had bad grade with my schoolwork she always cheered me up. We helped each other everytime one of us was in trouble. Now it has been already 5 years since we met. But she is still my best friend. Even if I am in US we still keep in touch. I am sure she will be my best friend forever.
