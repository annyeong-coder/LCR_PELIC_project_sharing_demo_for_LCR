What makes me decide which shoes to buy When I buy shoes I consider several things. For one thing I consider the use of the shoes. If I go to a formal place I'll need shoes like high heels. If I go to a park or a supermarket near my house I'll need shoes like sneakers. Another thing I consider is what design the shoes have. I don't like normal styles I like a unique design for shoes. Design is one way is self expression. Then the most important thing is how comfortable the shoes are. I need shoes to fit well for me. We wear shoes everyday. The wise choice of shoes is important and makes me happy everyday.
