My long weekend I was very happy to have a long break I relaxed. I didn't do anything special on last Friday evening. On saturday morning I drove my older son to the Violin class. When he was in his class I spent for 2 hours at the library. I was enjoyiny reading the story about Chinese immigrants. After that we had a lunch at KFC in Shadyside. I knew a fast food is unhealthy food but children love it. It is ok for once a month especially for a holiday. Afternoon we visited the Carnegy Art and History Museum. The kids like dinosaurs. Doesn't matter it is a dinosaur's fossil or a video about dinosaurs. My older son he is 10 year old he read every word on the wall about dinosaurs. Little boy is 3 year old he pushed the button to display the pictures of dinosaurs. He played 100 times. He talked laughed and applauded. I felt so bored but he was very interested in that. Anyway I enjoyed watching my kids I enjoyed being a mom. We had a good time in the museum. On Sunday I volunteered at the Baptist Home. I took the residents to the church and I learned the bible too. I'd like to work with people. We learned from each other we helped each other. They taught me some English and American culture I suported them to transport I acompanyed them. Yesterday was a last day for holiday break I cooked some delicious food for my family. My old son complished me mom you should open a Chinese restaurant. The dishes appealed them the smile appeared on my face. Time flies the weekend passed so quickly. Whatever I had a big break I got a great relax I enhanced my energy and now I am ready for school.
