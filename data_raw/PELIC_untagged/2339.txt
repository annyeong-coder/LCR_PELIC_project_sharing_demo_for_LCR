I have been seeing a movie ETEPMOM three times for one year. ETEPMOM was one of the best films in 1997. It was wonderful funny emotion and uplifting too. Julia Roberts role played a stepmother successfully in the movie However she didn't have worked at Hollywood and didn't have won an Oscars award by the time. When she got an Oscars award she had been making most exquisite roles hardly for a few years. I always like her movie ETEPMOM is one for her movie. This movie describes a story for specific family before many years. The graceful woman was an advertiser who worked at a large company married a business's man who brought his a son and a daughter naturally the woman become a stepmom. In the new family everyone had to fit the new life it was hard. When the movie started the stepmom was getting a lot of problems from their stepchildren who didn't welcome her because they hoped that their mom and dad married again. When they knew their dad couldn't do they very hated their stepmom. They made many trouble to against their stepmom. For example the son cooked a cup of 'coffee' sent to her and then he was carefully looking forward to her to drank. She drank the 'coffee' momentarily she looked like die. I killed her he said happily. Faced to the problems she thought about something she quit her job spent a lot of time to take care the children. Finally her love changed children's mind they had already had a wonderful family. I think the ETEPMOM is my favorite movie.
