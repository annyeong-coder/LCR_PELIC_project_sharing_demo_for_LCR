One of my best friend I have ever made is my friend ANON_NAME_0. I met him accedntly while Iwas looking for my class in University I asked him then he just said follow me because luckely he was in the same class. Our friendship bond grew firmly and tremendously that we became more than brothers. I found him helpful in very difficult situation and he proved the saying Friend in need is friend indeed .
