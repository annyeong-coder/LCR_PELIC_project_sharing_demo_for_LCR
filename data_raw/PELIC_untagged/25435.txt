When the children opened the door and let Margot out of the closet she had cried and upset because she couldn't see the sun and she couldn't speak because she had been shocked why the children did that. Then the children were sorry and took her out. Then they tried to make her happy. They asked her to forget them and let them do anything to let her be content but she didn't speak any word and she went home. One day after she came to children and told them you did the wrongest thing to me but I forget you because I want to be your friend. Then they hug her and went out to play together.
