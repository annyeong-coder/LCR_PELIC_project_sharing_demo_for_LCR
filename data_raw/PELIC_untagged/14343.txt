When I was young I lived in the north of Thailand. My next door is a salon where my mother often went for hair cut. I also remember the first time when I had my hair cut in that salon. I remembered that every weekend I like to sit in front of the house and talked with the people who walk pass. My neightbor who lived opposite to my house often came to talk with my mom and her daughter whose dog was very big was in the same age as me. At the back of my house there was a big playground where I loved to go out to play with my sister. I remembered the time when I lived there but couldn't tell it all because there are so many things to talk about.
