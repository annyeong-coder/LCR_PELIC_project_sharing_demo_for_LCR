I spent lots of time in my bedroom. It is my favorite place and I clean it up every week. I like to listen to my music there and every time my mother heard the music she will ask me to turn it down sometimes the music is too loud my mom will turn it off by herself. I feel very comfortable in my bedroom. I am now thinking to touch up the wall in my bedroom when I back to Taiwan.
