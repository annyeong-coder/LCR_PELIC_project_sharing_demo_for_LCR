My friends have learned English for seven years and they have lived in U. S. For five years. My friends have worked in the University of Pittsburgh since 2002. They have had a son since 2005 and they have had a daughter since 2006. They have been parents for two years and they like it. And they have lived in different apartments in Pittsburgh in the last apartment they have lived since 2005 because they think this apartment is near to the park and this place is better place for the children. They have had different cars in Pittsburgh the last car they have had for four years. And they have bought a computer for five years.
