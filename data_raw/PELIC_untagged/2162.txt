There are different cultural expectations of success for males and females. For example Males and females both in China can chance to get good job but working chance for males are wider than females so becoming a successful females are more difficult than becoming a successful males. In China males think they earn many money is a successful thing. They expect to support their family by themselves. They don't like their wife go to work. On the other hand females think they must be go to work because if they get job they fell safety and dependent but they want to get good job too difficult for them many company think if females are married they can't work well. For example if you are married you need time to give birth to your child you need to spend almost time on looking after your child you couldn't have more energy to your work. So many company give offer males more than females. What I'm trying to say is that if a wife earns salary more than her husband it is a trouble for couple relationship because her husband's feeling will be bad his confident is hurt. For females also this is a problem becoming a successful woman. So becoming successful females are more difficult than becoming successful males.
