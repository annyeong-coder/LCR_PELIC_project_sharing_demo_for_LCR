If I were able to travel any country I would go to Saudi Arabia. Because it is the hometown of my lots of classmates. Also I want to discover misery middle east culture beautiful architecture and the most luxurious city Dubai. If I were a billionaire I could consume all luxury regardless the price. If I have good friends in S. A I will travel easily. If I endeavor to study I can speak Arabic well.
