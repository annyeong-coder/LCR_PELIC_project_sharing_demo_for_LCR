In the United States there are 50 different states with a variety number of cities some of which have similarities and differences according to their location weather population and architecture. Two of the beautiful cities that I have visited are Pittsburgh PA and Dallas TX. In these two cities I found some differences and some similarities that I will mention. One difference between the two cities is the geography. Pittsburgh is mainly a city of hills and heights. Most of the roads are sloping. It is strenuous for people to move around the city by waking or biking. In contrast Dallas is a flat city. In Dallas we can see large flat lands with agriculture areas. Another obvious difference between Pittsburgh and Dallas is the weather. In Pittsburgh the weather is cold and unstable most of the time. The sky of Pittsburgh is cloudy and unclear most of the time and it has only few clear days per year whereas in Dallas the weather is more stable and warm in 9 months of the year. The sky is mostly sunny and clear. Both of them are attractive and great places to visit. It is true that Pittsburgh and Dallas have some differences in many areas yet they are alike.
