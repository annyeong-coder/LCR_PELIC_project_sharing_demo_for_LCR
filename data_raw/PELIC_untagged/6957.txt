People have many habits. Some habits are bad. As habits are often involuntary and have been ingrained for long time it is difficult to change. Habits are deeply during with life. If we change habits we can change our life. In my case there are three kinds of bad habits I have. One habit is behavior. I have an action which I do involuntary. I can't use chopsticks well. I can't grab it in proper way. I don't pay attention about it because it is too usual thing. I know that it is ashamed that I can't use it. However it is hard to change as I have done in wrong way for long time and got used to. I have heard that person who doesn't use chopsticks well is not good at writing. In fact my writing is bad. Second is a habit involving behavior and thinking. Even If you notice your habit it is not easy to change. I defer a tasks what I can do now. I often defer thing that I dislike because I thought that I still have time to do. As a result I do it by halves and just barely make it. For example I defer the homework. I go to bet without doing homework and do it in the morning. I can't concentrate because I am pressed for time. By doing early I can spend enough time and have reserves. It is really different in feeling. The last habit is way of thinking. I think negative. I become that before I do something nervous. It can't help anything and has no good. It is more important to do than to think. Negative thinking makes me introvert. Then I miss a chance to do something new. When I act active and experience a lot I can grow up more. There are a lot of habits. I divide habits into three kinds. It is hard change habits because it is an accumulation of everyday life.
