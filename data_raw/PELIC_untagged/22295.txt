Hi I'm Bomb . I've been building this site and I've written this page to introduce my hobby. I grew up in Bangkok Thailand with my family. I studied in computer engineering and I've worked in my job for 4 years but when I have had time I have been taking time with my hobby. First I learned to shoot a photograph with my father and I've used a film camera took my family pictures my friend pictures for one year. After that I changed the film camera to the digital camera and I've been shooting a lot of natural photos and life style photos. But In fact I never sent my photographs to photography contests. However I've been hopping you enjoy watching my photographs.
