It's very important that I met my husband more than 15 years ago. I met him at a party when I was in high school. I went to Girls' high school and he went to boys' high school. My friend hold a dinner party and I met him there. When I met him I was talking to another boy. I didin't talk with him at that time because he was sitting at the other table. On the other day we gathered again and went to the amusement park. While I was taking a roller coaster with my future husband he made me laugh many times and I enjoyed being together. However our personal characters were so different and his behavior was sometimes annoying me. I didn't like his overreaction and spaeking loudly. We have known each other since we were high school students surprisingly our peronalities changed year by year so it got comfortable to me to be with him.
