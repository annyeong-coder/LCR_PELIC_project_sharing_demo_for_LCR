I remember the day when my family moved a new apartment. I lived a 23 floor in which I could see a beautiful scene. At that time I was a soldier for whom I work I couldn't stay for a long time. I liked my apartment where I lived because I could see a beach sunup sundown. And I liked my apartment an elevator which I could go fast.
