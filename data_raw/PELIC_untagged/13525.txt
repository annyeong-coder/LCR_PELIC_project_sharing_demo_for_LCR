I support the bail out for several reasons. First the bail out not only gives hope to banks but also saved the confidence of citizens. Many retired citizens and going to retire citizens have put much of their retirement money in different kinds of funds. Many of them have lost a big amount of retirement money because of the bankruptcy of banks like the Lehman Brothers and Washington Mutual. It is crucial to build confidence in people by saving then banks. Second many people's security of lives is depended on banks and insurance companies. The bail out will be able to get the banks and insurance companies out of huge debts which will in return help to stable people's lives. I understand come people's concern about inflation but with a series of right policies the inflation can be controlled below a safe level. In deed the government should regulate the financial market and constraint the rustless behavior of some Wall Street banks. However the bail out is necessary to put out the fire near our eyebrows.
