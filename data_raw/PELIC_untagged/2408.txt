Mr. Ho who was my superior is a brilliant kind engineer. He is also one of my best friends whom I admire. He is not only as my friend but also as a member of my family. When I worked for a company as an electrical engineer in Taiwan I met him. In the beginning I was not acquainted with him. I only heard a lot of his achievements from my colleagues such as he got several championships in the world. After some months because we collaborated on a project I gradually knew more and more about the man. In the course of doing the project I found he was an intelligent person. For instance when we were required by customers to design new systems he already knew how to do before we undertook to design them furthermore he also realized what the weaknesses of the systems were and how to improve them in the future. From his design I could know he was an experienced engineer whom I had never seen. In addition he was glad to share what he knew. I had learned many things from him not only in the profession but also in his psychology. Sometimes he would talk with me about how to treat people and how to deal with some dilemmas in the everyday life. He was like a living encyclopedia in which I could get the information I need. I can not imagine how a human can understand so much knowledge. He is really a wise clever guy. Now he possesses his own small enterprise. He modestly told me he is not eager to set up a big company because he only wants to earn the moderate money takes care of his family well does what he would like and especially in the free time he can volunteer for charities. These are all which can delight him even though I know he can rake in a great deal of money easily if he wants. In conclusion in the rest of my life I will not forget every thing related to him with me and he is my idol.
