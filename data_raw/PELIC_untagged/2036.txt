An old culture often a parent arranged a husband for their daughter but some a man he found a women by himselft. When he had taken a women go out he would let her parent had known. I am telling about a couple whom I know well. Women's parent arranged a husband for her the man and women met each other at women's house. The women did not like the man but she married him her parent wanted. First time she did not like him until she had the first daughter she began to love him. She said since she married her husband do everything for her althourght she has never tell him what she want. She has been happy and her lovely has more every day. Now she has one daughter and one son her family is happy with her husband this the parent arranged for her.
