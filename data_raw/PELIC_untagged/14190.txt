Is it difficult for you to reject someone's inviting like a telemarketer It does not make sense actually that I will call you back in order to turn down the telemarketer's inviting so I will show you the good way to reject them through my experience. One Saturday morning my cell phone rang suddenly and woke me up. The voice from the phone was so sweet cheerful and in hurry that I misunderstood she loved me but I did not know who she was totally. She firstly explained how good her English language school was and kept on talking me into signing up for the form of the school though I had never seen her and never told her what I wanted to study English. At last I found out what her purpose was and then I asked her many questions about her not the school. Finally she gave up talking with me and I could make her hang up. That's one of my polite rejections to telemarketers.
