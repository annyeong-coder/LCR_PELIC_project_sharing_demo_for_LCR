Hi everybody I 'm writing this note to introduce myself to you. My name is Jojo. I am from Taiwan. I have been here 5 months. I live in Shadyside in Pitts. I am interesting about tasting wine cooking and eating delicious food. I always reach about wine and food in the internet. I want to try about different countries foods. I like travel and new things. I plan to study finish Level 5 in ELI. I hope learning to cook about different countries food in US. My hobbies are watching TV and going outside with friends. I wish I studied English very well and had a nice experience in US.
