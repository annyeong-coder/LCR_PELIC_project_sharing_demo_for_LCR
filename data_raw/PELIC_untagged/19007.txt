On the Internet I can see many beautiful pictures of Europe. As time goes by Traveling Europe became one of my dream. If I get a chance to travel I would go to Europe. First I want to go to France. There are so many things to see such as Eiffel tower and triumphal arch. I also want to go to Austria. Austria is well known for nice music. I love nice music that make me comfort. Another thing I want to go to Austria is that I have some Korean friends in there so I can hang out with them. My favorite country in Europe is England. Actually before I came here U. S. For study English I really wanted to go to England because I love British accent. England is the country of the soccer and I really like playing and watching soccer. I want to see hear and feel all of these countries' cultures.
