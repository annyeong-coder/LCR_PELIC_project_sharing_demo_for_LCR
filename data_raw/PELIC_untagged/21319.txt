I going to finish the ELI English class this semester. I think I can gain many knowledge from reading class. For example Rebeca taught me how to skim and scan the passage in order to read the passage faster and enhance my reading ability to be better. Besides she helps me to clarify the words that I did not know the meaning or ambiguous words. She has never imposed any idea to us so we can use our opinion to choose the answers and we also have chance to ask her to explain to us when we answered questions wrong. For these reason the reading class inspires me to cultivate my English skill so I think I will have a good proclivity for reading in the foreseeable future. I hope that I can us impeccable English soon.
