about two years ago I was late for my class and I forgot my books then my teacher told my you have 15 min to brought your books but my house was located approximately 30 minutes from the college . I was really upset because I know I don't have enough time for that . I shouldn't have been late so often but he might have talked to me about the late and I told him I had problem in my car but he didn't believe me . Also he ought to have warned me about the traffic but when he told my you just have 15 min I should have driven fast to arrive before that time .
