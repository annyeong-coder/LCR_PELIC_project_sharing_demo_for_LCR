I like to see movies with my family members who are my husband and my son. 'Night at the museum' directed by Shawn Levy is one of the best movies. He one of the most successful directors is famous for comedy director. Anyone interested in adventure movie should see this movie. 'Night at the museum' starring Ben Stiller and Robin Williams is the top earning film in Korea. Ben Stiller playing Larry Deli is a failure as a businessman but a good father to his son at the movie. He is a night guard whom every people dislike to be at the natural museum. Robin Williams famous for 'Dead Poets Society' plays President Franklin D. Roosevelt at that movie. I like any movie featuring Robin Williams. His movies most of which I have seen are very popular in Korea.
