The organized activity is absolutely established from teachers or people who are responsible for teaching children and that could be a disadvantage to children because teachers make children follow the traditional activities and not be a creative in the future. However induvusial creativity comes directly from children when they do activities without any observations. In my perspective schools have their own strategic plans that they believe in. Therefore they cannot concentrate on two ways for creativity so they rather use one way.
