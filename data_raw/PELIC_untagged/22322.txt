I've been living in Pittsburgh for ten months. My son and I arrived in th US last year and in that moment we met my new family because they were waiting for us. Furthermore we celebrated all of our holidays like a big family in our house and I prepared my traditional food for the special moment. At times I missed my family but I knew this that would happen.
