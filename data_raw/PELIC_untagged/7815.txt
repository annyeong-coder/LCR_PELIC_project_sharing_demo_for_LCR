I will talk about my brother . He has many different interests and hobbies . First when he was a child he used to swim 3 or 4 times a week . Also he has always liked to collect stamps so he has been collecting stamps since he was 8 years old . Another thing he also liked to do is playing judu he played judu when he was 11 years old but just for 3 years and then he stopped . After that when he grew up his hobbies changed a little bit . He started to go out with his friends and have fun with them. He also has been playing football with his friends since he was a kid .
