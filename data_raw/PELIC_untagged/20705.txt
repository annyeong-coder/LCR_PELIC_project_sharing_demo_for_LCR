I set the time for my son to play games every day. My son is very good at manipulating me to have more game time. For example sometimes he says he had a hard day and need to relax or he showed me his As and said he deserve something. My friend has a daughter who is the most manipulative girl I've even seen. Her parents would let her have whatever she wants when she's screaming or crying.
