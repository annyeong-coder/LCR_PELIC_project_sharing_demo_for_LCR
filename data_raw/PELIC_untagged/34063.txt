Five years ago I was still an undergraduate. But since 2008 I has gotten my diploma. Last year I made a decision to get the master degree aboard. So I worked in a architecture office until this April. This year I went to the ELI in Pittsburgh and I have studied Englisg here for 3 months. Lately I have spent my time in preapring the final exams for all the classes so now I had no time to waste.
