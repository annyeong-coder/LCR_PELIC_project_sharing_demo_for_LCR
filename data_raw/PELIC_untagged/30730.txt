My dream trip is to go to the Himalaya Mountain which is located in Nepal. And climb to the top of Mount Everest. And try the experience of camping in the mountain. And also the atmosphere of cooking in the top of mount Everest. And how climbing this mountain will make me feel it is indescribable. Then I could try out hunting to survive. It will be the best trip ever.
