When I and Harima became a good friend we were high school students. Our high school were different but we had been to same cram school. While we were studying in the cram school we knew well each other. We studied very hard. After graduating high school we went to different college but our friendship continued because our major were same. She has lived in Nagoya where is located in middele part of Japan now but our friend ship has continued so I really appreciate our meeting.
