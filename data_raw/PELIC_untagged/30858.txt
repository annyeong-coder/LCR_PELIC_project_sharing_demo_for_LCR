I do many kinds of things on Fridays and Sundays. Some are different and some are similar. The activities between my typical Fridays and Sundays are different. I am busy on Fridays. I always wake up early in the morning at about 7 00 on Friday because this is the last day of my taking classes of the week. After classes are over I always go to the library with my friends. We always do some homework or discuss the papers that we have done during the whole week. In contrast I am off on Sundays so I always do some interesting activities such as fishing shopping and hiking with my friends or my husband. I do not have to get up early in Sunday mornings. I wake up whenever I want and do whatever I want. It is so free on Sundays. Another obvious difference between Fridays and Sundays is the mood. I feel more exited and happy on Fridays even though I have more work to do on Fridays instead of Sundays. I know I am going to have two days' off which makes me very delightful. On the other hand despite a whole day off on Sundays I feel less happy because the day after Sunday I have to go back to school to study. The mood is totally different between the two days. In spite of the activities and mood between Fridays and Sundays are so much different Fridays also has some similarities compared with Sundays. For example I always cook by myself either Fridays or Sundays. Another similarity between them is that I always sleep after 12 00 am and I am now trying to correct this bad habit. Although I have many different things to do during Fridays and Sundays I love both Fridays and Sundays.
