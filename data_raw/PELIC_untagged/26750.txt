There are a lot of kinds of relationship between people in all societies such as friendship and marriage. Everyone cannot live isolated from his or her society so they always make a relationship between others. The most popular kind is a friendship. It is like a god gift when you meet a special person who will be your best fiend all your life. My best friend is ANON_NAME_0 who is sociable and so kind. I met her in the university when I was waiting in the Cafeteria line. At first we did a little speech because she was studying at another specialty so I unfortunately I saw her a little. I was surprised when I knew that she will go to the U. S for studying. The surprise was when I knew that she will go to the same city Pittsburgh . I was so lucky because she traveled with me in the same day too. I discovered her beautiful personality when we were staying in Washington D. C for Saudi Culture Mission process . Now she is my best friend ever I love her so much and I wish her to achieve her goals and has a great life.
