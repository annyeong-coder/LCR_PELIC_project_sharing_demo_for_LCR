At theses days cell phones become popular use in most places. One of them is the classroom. Many people and teachers state that using cell phones in the classroom are rude interrupt teaching and don't allow student to focus on the lecture. On the other hand students believe that cell phones are very helpful. They can use them to find information or using the dictionary. In my view we have to impose new rules that prevent using cell phones in the classroom to help student to focus don't interrupt their idea or teachers while they are teaching. Although we can not ignore that cells phones now is a main part of our life we have to impose new rules that prohibited using cell phones in the class. When the phone is ringing while teacher is speaking in most cases all people in the class turn around to a person whose phone is ringing. In that case ringing cell phones interrupt the teacher's ideas and also student. Also people who use cell phone in the class they can not compatible between listening to the teacher and searching for information. In conclusion even though many places allow using cell phone we should impose new rules to restrict using cell phones n some places such as classroom. New rules will reinforce the field of education to be better and to get high benefits when the students in the class.
