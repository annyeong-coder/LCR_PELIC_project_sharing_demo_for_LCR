This is my family photograph that I brought from Korea. The people who are in front of waterfall where we tripped are my family. The man who puts a gray suit on is my father. And the woman who stands next to my father is my mother who is very tender to me like my friends. The boy who wears stripe pants is my younger brother. My brother who I'm looking forward to meet in here was shorter than me when he and me were children. Finally the girl who has a sullen look is me. I don't know why I didn't smile when I was taken this picture. The pink necklace that I wear was my favorite one at that time. Although I don't remember where we went this picture makes me happy.
