In my opinion I think an acquaintance is someone who works or studies in the same place. It is someone that I always meet in places or someone who I can say hi give a smile and can become a friend. Friend is someone who I can talk to. It is someone who I can hang out and have fun with or someone who I might have something in common with. Best friend is someone who is deeper than friend. It is someone who I can count on. Someone who I might not see them often but always be there to support. Someone who can give me the same thing that I give them. Best friend is someone who accepts the way I am.
