A long time ago I had an experience with a classmate in high school. I wish I had followed my intuition that day. In fact I didn't like him personally. He asked me a favor. My inner voice scrammed NOOOOO but one of my weakness points is I can't say no for any person ask me to help him regardless how this person is! He asked me to lend him money because he really wanted something and his family couldn't give him many because they didn't afford it. For instance I didn't wait something in return even paying back my money! If I had gathered my strength I would have said no but as I said I can't resist say SURE for someone ask me for help. I didn't know how he understood that I would humiliate him in front of our classmates!!!!! So as a reaction form him since that day he had made trouble to me. He had tried to ruin my repetition and my relationship with my friends so if I had said no that day I would have faced his bad intentions.
