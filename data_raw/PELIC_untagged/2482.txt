The Success in My Life Most people in the world have goals in their lives. Some of them want to be successful in their careers in academics or in relationships. All of these are goals but in my opinion if I want to be successful in my life I should get all that I want right way. Some people think that if they do some things bad like steal kill and lie and nobody knows about what they do they are successful in their life. Regarding me there is many people that help me to be successful in my life including my family and my husband. When I was a child my family gave me some advice on everything I did or that I wanted to do. Sometimes my parents were strict with me because I did some thing bad. At that time I felt upset and angry towards my parents but now I believe they were helping me to improve myself. Second my parents were encouraging me when I got a high grade in my study. Also they were giving me gifts and some times they have been promising me to go any where I wanted. I really appreciate what they did for me and I will never forget that. There is someone else that helps me to complete my successful story in my life. He is my husband. First he helps me understanding with the people on a good way like how to be more polite with impolite person. Second he encourages me to complete my graduate study for example he persuades me to get master's degree in teacher English programs or an MBA. I like his method when he talks with me about success and how to cultivate good things in myself. I am very grateful for anyone helps me in my whole life.
