An ideal educational setting would be the one that is free from the psychological pressures that inhibit a child's creativity occur early in life according to the author. Two of the creativity killers are surveillance and evaluation these two working in the same way. The feeling of being watched and the wariness of how people will judge the work will hide the creative urge and will make the kids think of how much grade they get not how successful is the work. The other two killers the author mentioned are competition and rewards. Putting kids in the situation that there is only a winner and loser and winner get extreme award such as gold and toys this will eliminate the mean of group working or activities and also remove its creativity. For this the author wants cooperative schools for the students. The other creativity killers that the author think are not supposed to be in schools are over control restricting choice and pressure. The author want the instructors to let the kids work and play the way that they want because they will show and do there best quietly of the things they like not the thing that they are forced to do. Also they have to choose their own activities because mostly they like them and they will be Encouraged to do well. The author said Establishing grandiose expectation for a child's performance . That is mean aspect the kids interests and this can't be true all the time. So all the above should not be a part of an ideal school according to the author.
