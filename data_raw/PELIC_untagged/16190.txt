In my school I have many classes that are similar. My grammar class and writing class have three common similarities. The first thing in common is the teachers. The grammar class as well as writing class both teachers have good a education and intelligent. Anther common is the grammar class and writing class both have benefit. For example the grammar class teaches me fundamentals for the speaking and the writing class teaches me the organizing of the idea. The last common similarities is they are both difficult. The grammar class is tricky and writing class is the same. Each day we are learing how to understand these tricky words and use it. That what make the grammar class and writing class have similarities teachers benefit and difficulty.
