I like music. I have learned guitar for 10 years. My mom bought me a nice guitar when I was a elementary school student. I have been to a lot of music concerts. Besides I like dog too. I have been raising a dog for 7 years. My friend gave the dog to me as a birthday present. My dog has been living with me since it was 2 month old. This summer I visited a beautiful mountain town and brought my dog together. I enjoy my dog's accompanying very much.
