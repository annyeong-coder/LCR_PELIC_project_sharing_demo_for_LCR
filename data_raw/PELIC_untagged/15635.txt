As you know a economic crisis effect on people s life deleteriously. Five years ago some economic experts in Turkey claimed that people continue saving their money Turkey s economy might be in a slump. I heard them but I didn t listen them. If I had changed my money in to dollar I would have been rich women. Another mistake in my life is that when I was pregnant I had exorbitant pain on my leg. This was not normal but I didn t mention to my doctor. If I had mentioned my doctor about my pain I would have not operated on my leg. Now I cannot have another baby because it is dangerous for me. If my doctor says me OKEY I would be pregnant again. I wish I had two or more than two children. I hope I will have a lot of grandchildren
