One very cold day in last winter I went to Chinese food store for shopping when I arrived there I noticed a old woman who looks like a homeless holding a little money had stood in front of the gate of the store. I tried to find 1 or 2bucks to her but having no any money I couldn't give her at that time. So I decided to give her money after getting cash back by buying something. Finally I gave her 2 bucks and she said to me god bless you with thankful smile.
