In this year I came to Pittsburgh which is a beautiful city to study English. In ELI class there are thirteen adults who are come from many different countries. I am come from Taiwan which is very small and worm city. Cindy who also comes from Taiwan is my classmate. In the beginning of living in the USA I had a problem that was bringing me down. Eating in the Pittsburgh which is very interesting experience is too expensive for me. For me it is hard to accept that I need to spend so much money to eat one meal. Cindy who has studied here last semester talked me don't need to so serious on food expend. She tell me that food is necessary expend on the daily life. And she teaches me how to cook some simple food by myself. Cindy who lives near my home is my godmother's niece. Sometimes Cindy my godmother and I went to shopping and do some volunteer job together. That is great things for me to make a new friend. I think after we go back to Taiwan we will keep contact with each other.
