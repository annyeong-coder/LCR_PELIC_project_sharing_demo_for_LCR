Nowadays the pressures of being a student are very various and serious in school. Fitst of all in case of Korean entrancing a university is very importnat. A future may depend on name of unversity. Our education competition is very serious. Our country's culture has still a faction. Even though a faction culture diminishes that is deep rooted in Korea. After taking the Korea SAT someone who is not satisfied suicides. Korea students have a serious pressures. Second students must continue a good friendships. Students don't like being excluded from friends but we often annoy a weak friend. We hit and insult him. That is wrong but If I don't annoy someone they would annoy me. That situation is very difficult whether I afflict him or not. Students must follow the majority even though that is wrong behavior. Finally we must get a job. It is not too much to say that my marriage money dream depends on my job. But we are diffcult of getting a good job. Every year Korea produce many bachelor but demand is not too enough. Todays my friends are my enemy. If I must win them I can get a good job. I think job problem is the biggest pressure of being a student.
