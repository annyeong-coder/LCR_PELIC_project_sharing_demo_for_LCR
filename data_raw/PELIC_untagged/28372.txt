Regret is a theme that is represented in both essays. The main characters in those works had made mistakes in the past that they regret. Even though they have been given a second chance and they have dramatically changed deep down they still struggle and feel they don't deserve it. Al the main character in The Primitive Tongue of a Lesser Species transformed from an active drug addictive and alcoholic to a loving grandfather who appreciates and enjoys every moment with his family especially his lovely grandsons. Yet once in a while he remembers that in one day he was able to slap an innocent eight year old child destroy his confidence and hurt his feelings. He wonders sometimes if he is still capable of hurting another child. He can't believe that life gave him another chance and how it is even possible for a person with his shameful past to have this wonderful family and to deserve all the love confidence respect and trust they invested in him. On the other hand the grandfather in the Grandpa's Vessel essay was a stern stubborn and strict man and it was the disease that has changed him to a different man surprisingly to a better person. He became sensitive gentle innocent and has a spirit of a child. And most of that he started to talk more than his family have ever heard him did before. In the story he waits in the pasture just to glance the emergence of steers from afar. He refers to them as holy. The same creatures that he used to slap their backs in the past are now considered precious and beautiful. He wants to take them to his vessel but he says that he doesn't deserve them and he cries when he utters those words. Both stories end with the crying of the main characters. To me this repents an indication that they could not go beyond their past and let it go. They regret what they had done and it is hard for them to forgive themselves.
