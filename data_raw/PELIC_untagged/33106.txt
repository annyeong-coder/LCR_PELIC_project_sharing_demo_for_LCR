Making a decision is crucial for everyone since we do not know the consequences of the decision. No regrets everyone has a specific path which the person still does not know. If I had a machine that takes me back I would change a lot decision I have made in my life. First I would have become a soccer player if I had joined a soccer team after high school. Had I become a soccer player I would have played in Spain. I wish I could do that. However if I were a soccer player I wouldn't be able to pursue my study in the US. Should I continue my study I will postpone the idea being a soccer coach. I hope that my dreams will come true.
