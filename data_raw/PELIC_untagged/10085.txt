The scientists elaborated a questionnaire to test the perception of personality in many countries A first sample of volunteers judged their own personality according to the questionnaire. A second sample of people judged the first group. Each person in that sample judge a person he knows in the first sample. A third sample of people judged their perception of a typical personality of their culture. Then the scientists compare the three averages of the three samples. The results show that the first and second average are close to each other. However the third average is far different from the two in most countries. Conclusion there was not concordance between the typical personality and what they actually measured.
