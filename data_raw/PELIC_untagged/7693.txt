I think some of Dr. Schwart's advices are valuable. For example I consider that don't disclose too much personal information online is very important. If you put too much personal information online like telephone number and home address maybe some strangers will molest you you will not have a peaceable life. Sometimes it's also dangerous because they know about lots of your information and they have chances to extort money from you. Next I think that spend time getting to know someone is also important. Some people will be nervous when you meet each other at first time it is possible that his expression is not well because of neverousness. If you can spend time going deep into his mind maybe you'll find that he is a very nice person and has some habits as same as you. I think some of her tips are very helpful if we can follow these advices we'll keep danger away and have a good time online.
