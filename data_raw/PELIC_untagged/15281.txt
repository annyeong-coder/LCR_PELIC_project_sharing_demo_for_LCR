Emre is my friend who is capable of studying in patient and a student at the University of Pittsburgh. He can stand front of his desk for long time study. Along with his hardworking personality he was able to write an article in a magazine. He will be able to get PhD. Degree at the university. On the other hand he sometimes can not find a free time for fun. Besides that he actually doesn't need to have a free time to entertain according to my observations. Studying has become a kind of habit for him. He is familiar with studying.
