In the bottom of the article the World Tourism Organization made the diagram predict that China will become the first destination country. I think the prediction is correct. Because there are many events can affect tourism such as the economics. China is an example of this. The economics in China is growing recently thus the living standard in China will become better than before. This is an important part which can attract foreigners come and have a visit. China is also a country with long history some architectures or antiques may also attract tourists. Besides the economics element the security also plays an important role in attracting tourists. Since many security problems happened in the world there are much more tourists they consider the security than before. If there is a war in the country it must reduce the will of tourists to travel there. Basing on the article it mentions East Asia Pacific is forecast to become the world's second most important generator of tourists. However the economics in East Asia Pacific is not as good as in the 20th century. The economics in those countries tend to grow slower than before. If the economic problem will not be solved in the future there might have fewer tourists than the author's prediction.
