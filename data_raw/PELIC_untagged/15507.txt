Food is essential for human's everyday life. Diversity of food is substantial and we are responsible for what we eat. People usually choose their food based on personal preferences health and religious reasons. The purpose of this essay is to compare and contrast between eating habits to minimaize the cultural shock and make the study more easier. Being in a different country I have noticed similarities and differences between my country's eating habits Saudi Arabia and the country I am studying in which is the United States of America USA . To begin with globalization has made the world a smaller place and when it comes to food Saudi Arabia and USA have a lot in common. First of all both countries have famous chain restaurants such as Subway Mcdonald's Burger King and Fuddruckers. The cost is also exactly the same at both countries. Moreover both countries do not offer dog meat such as South Korea. Most importantly both countries have three meals per day breakfast lunch and dinner. Second there is minor differences between the two countries. First in Saudi Arabia if we eat meat the animal must be slaughtered according to Islamic rules which is not common in the USA. In addtion comparing both types of foods we notice another difference. Since muslims are the majority in Saudi restaurnats there don't offer pork. The most notable difference between these two countries is how to eat the food. When eating traditional food In Saudi Arabia people use hands to eat while in the USA people use spoons and forks. In conclusion differences are so little such as the animal must be slaughtered pork meal and the way that we eat. On the other hand having all the famous chain restaurant that I'm used to back home same cost no dog meat and having three meals per day made my life easier while studying in the States and reduced the cultural shock.
