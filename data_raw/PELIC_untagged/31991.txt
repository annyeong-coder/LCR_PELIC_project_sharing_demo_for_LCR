Welcome! I'm Tike ANON_NAME_0 I've written this page to make friends. I was born in China and grew up there. But I came to USA two years ago and I have been living in Pittsburgh for ten months with my husband. I've been trying to improve my English since I came to USA. I have taken a lot of classes from different agents such as GPLC IWAP PRISM and I am currently attending the ELI program. My parents came to visit me last year they had both retired in China. Before that they had begun to dream about the time they will spend in America. By the time they had been studying English for several years. In my free time I like cooking. I have tried all kinds of food including cake pasta steak sushi etc. I've already been a good cook. I also like to make friends I've met several friends. If you have something to share with me please contact me.
