My parents gave a big help to me. When I was a middle school and high school student I always made problems. I didn't know where I should go where is my right destination. I didn't have a goal. I just played everyday. Friends didn't made me think the right thing. Teachers always get me to enter the university. But they just forced they didn't teach the reason. However my parents explained everything and help me think about my future. They let me do what I want. Although I gave many disappointments to my parent they always believe me. So I studied for me and for my parents. The end of twice challenge I had my parents laugh. My parents were proud of me so much. Now I have a goal I always draw my future. I really appreciate their love.
