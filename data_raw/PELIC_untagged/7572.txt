1 In some countries teenagers have jobs while they are still students is this a good idea outline good can learn social get money to manage by themselves independence manage time bad can be used by adults too young to work. Destroy their school life temptation In some countries teenagers have jobs while they are still students. People think that the teenagers can learn the society through working be independent and can manage their time and money. However there are several risks in their working so I disagree to the opinion. First of all I'd like point out the quality of the work. They are just teenagers. As a average junior or high school student they don't have any special technique to work. That means that they have only simple and low skill requiring jobs. They can earn a little money and enjoy the working for a while because they think they are already adults. But they can be exhausted after working and it can affect their school life. They should not sacrifice the important one for a little cheap experience. Second the real society is not like a school. The working is not a practice lecture in the class. Despite teenagers are the ones to be protected some adults may use them for their profits. Teenagers don't know the labor law and can't insist on their rights therefore the practice might result a bitten hurts. Nowadays the independence is a respect value. And in teenagers period they would like make money and manage their time and living by themselves. But the working experience could not so useful and the environment of teenagers' working is not safe. If they want to work on the real place the school or the parents make a program to take care of them or the real internship which would be starting in the university is enough to them. In spite of some benefits making teenagers work can have more serious problems.
