My ideal neighbor is cheerful. He always smiles for everybody. When I said him for first time at the parking he asked me if could he give me some help. So he is helpful. He speak politely also I have never heard him speak loudly. He is reliable because I haven't seen him come late to home and he always goes to a work early. He is a serious man. If I ask him to help me he do it happily. Finally he usually do something for me without I tell him anything he is considerate.
