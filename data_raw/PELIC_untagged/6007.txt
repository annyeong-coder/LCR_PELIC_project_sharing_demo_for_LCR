Thesis statement Japanese group mentality affects our behavior. In Japan main industry was agriculture for a long time. Japan is a small country and people had to cooperate with each other to gather as many crops as possible. It was impossible to live if they were forced out of the group. 1. People care how other people look at you. When mothers scold their children they say Everyone will laugh at you if you do such a thing. If someone in your family does a bad thing he she would be accused You have brought disgrace on our family. 2. Most elementary junior and senior high schools have school uniforms. In school each individual is buried in a group. We tend to think that we should be the same with others because we wear the same clothes and look the same. If you are extremely good extremely bad or different from others you will be forced out of your group. 3. We have very few discussion or debate classes at school. Teachers teach and students study by reading books and memorizing them. How much students memorize and understand them is more important than that they have their opinions about it. One of the reasons is that Japanese people don't like conflicts in a group.
