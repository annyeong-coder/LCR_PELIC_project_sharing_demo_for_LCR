Our planet is in trouble! Almost every day we seem to hear of yet another problem affecting the environment and what a list of problems! Pollution acid rain climate change the destruction of rainforests and other wild habitats the decline and extinction of thousands of species of animals and plants. We might unable to do anything with that problems but we have to do with what we have. For example the car pollution almost everyone now has a car for transportation. But with that we destroy our environment by producing unhealthy gas. So what we can do is to reduce the number of cars by using public transportation.
