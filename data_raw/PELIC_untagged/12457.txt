There are three main effects of hurricanes. First the hurricanes damaged our environment such as collapsed buildings braked roads and fallen trees. Due to the disaster the city looks like a ruins. Everything is stop include the transportation system and all of the shops. Only the hospital is full of people who are wounded or being died. However some of them become homeless because of the damage. The calamity brings a lot of bad effects to the ordinary life. Second the hurricanes always come with the storm and flood which ruined the economy. After through this the agriculture faces a battering. Because of the loss the price of the vegetable is double or triple than normal. Therefore people who inflicted the damage will pay a lot of money to repair their home. For example the storm may break the windows and roof so they need to renovate. After that they might also have some furniture to refit their decoration. Last if the situation was dangerous the government will announce the one day off. Take me for example I had a terrible memory before that I was going to a trip but due to the strongly storm we forced to go home imminently. As a result of that we got a half day off. The damage of the environment the inflation of economy and one day off are the effects of the hurricanes.
