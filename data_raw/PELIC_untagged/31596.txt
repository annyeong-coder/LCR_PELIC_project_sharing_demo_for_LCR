For me the best neighbor is reliable and discrete. He talks to everybody politely because he considerates everyone. He's serious but not too much he also knows when to have fun. He can often make parties but not too late because he respects his neighbours. He's neat and very helpful. The ideal neighbor is not boring and messy. He does not come late at the meetings and he's really easy to live with.
