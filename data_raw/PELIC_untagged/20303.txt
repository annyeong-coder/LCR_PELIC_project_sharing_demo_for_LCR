When I was in elementary school I wasn't one of smart students. I didn't figure out why I had to study and why studying was important. One day my mother received one call from my teacher. She told my mother that my parents should have concerned about my potential and fostered my ability. My mother told me the story over the telephone. I was surprised because I didn't acknowledge my teacher was interested in me and had an anticipation of me until the call. The incident sparked me to feel interested in a school life. I think it is crucial that adults make children feel themselves are very priceless and they are sure about their own ability even if they don't have any peculiar intrinsic skill.
