Sports stars earn ridiculously large salaries Many people think sports stars earn ridiculously large salaries. It's really true. In china many football stars earn 100 times salaries than average people even though they don't play well. Many sports stars said it is just because they work so hard and stressfull. They strive for this when they were children. They can't play sports after they are 25 35 years old. Since they can earn a lot only few years it's reasonable they get a large salaries. However most of them don't know how to manage their money because they are so young and the money they earned is gotten so easy. They always spend most of the money before they retire.
