Shakira She is a colombian singer song writer. She was born in 1977 in Baranquilla. Her emphasis in the music is the pop rock in spanish but she also sings in english. Her most famous album is servicio de lavanderia with songs like whenever wherever and ay te dejo madrid . She is recognized for the way she dance because her moves are based on arabic dancing. Since she was a child she begans to sing in her home. And at the age of 8 years her life changed completely just like Evelyn Glennie. Who at the age of 8 years began to lose her hearing. The life of Shakira changed in a good way because at this age she wrote her first song tus gafas oscuras inspired in her father. Since this moment she decided to be a famous singer. She does not live with wolves like Helene Grimaud who lives with 3 wolves in her own house. But Shakira wrote she wolf or loba . Shakira is still alive she is 33 years old and all colonbians hope that she lives more years because she is doing and exellent work and she has represented our country very well. So we hope that she doesnt have the same pain as Bethoven who the scientist think that he dead from lead poisoning. In my perspective Shakira is a good singer a like a lot of her songs but there are some songs that I dont like like she wolf . My favourite song is ciega sordo muda I think that this album is the best that she has done. Shakira has a significant job because she represent one country I think that she and other colombians like juanes are capable to change the vision that all the world has about colombia.
