I've dreamed to go to wonderful beach for the long time such as in Florida or Cancun in Mexico. In my country we don't have the beach that has the water emeralded colorful and as a scene in the movie. We can see that beach in some movies. If I go there I might feel like that I was dead but now I'm doing breath. The girls running with their pets people playing volleyball music flowing out somewhere and me who is lying on the white sand as if that's my bed. Think about it. Is it possible in your life Can you accept it I really want to go there! And feel a gentle breeze from the ocean with the warm air around me. In addition I'm going to drink a beer! I can't drink as well so I hate drinking but perhaps I think I'll be able to do it and that can be cool for me! Because I can smell from the barbecue which someone are cooking. Now I'm writing about my dream which I've wanted but I can imagine that I'm looking around that view spreading front of me. After this semester or the middle of this term I have plan to go there. How about you all reading my paragraph Do I need to say more
