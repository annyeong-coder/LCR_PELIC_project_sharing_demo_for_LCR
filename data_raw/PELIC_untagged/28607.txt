Travel to study I don't think it is necessary to travel to the country where a language is spoken. Because it's so difficult to leave your family and because it cost a lot of money. Many people believe you must travel to learn new language. Learning new language is something will benefit us in our life. So the student will get the language and the ability to speak and right to fast. I understand that travel to learn new language is good for the students. They can speak with many native speakers and they can learn more about their culture but travel to study is not necessary so much. We can learn new language without traveling. If anyone wants to study he can studys in his country by using some books or CD. It's better than be far a way of your family and losing money because not all people can afford to buy to travel abroad. In conclusion I think people shouldn't travel to study because it isn't necessary. We have many options to study new language such as buy and read some books ans watch some movies. Also we can join any institutes or schools of learning new language. So we can being next to our families and we can also saving money.
