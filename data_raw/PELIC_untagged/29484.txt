I came to Pittsburgh two months ago. I have rented an apartment. I took a placement test at ELI on 1 10 2011. Next day I met a student advisor. She gave me my schedule. I have been studying at ELI since 1 11 2011. I have taken the IELTS test for once. I have been preparing to the TEOFL test for one month.
