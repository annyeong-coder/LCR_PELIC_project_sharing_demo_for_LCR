If I have the chance and a great amount of money to I would like to travel to many places but I wish that I can see Japan especially for many reasons. First I red and heard about this country a lot of stories which interest me For instance to see how organized these people in their life and try their healthy food Also I would like to see their ancient building with great civilization and unique architecture with all the bright colors. Another reason I have never seen polite people as much as the Japanese how they talk treat and respect the others For example I saw this situation many times only from Japanese people when someone came late in the class and his her seat in the front he she walk bowing all the way to the chair to not confuse other students or block their path. The most important reason is to see two cities called Hiroshima and Nagasaki I have read a lot of stories about these sad cities so I wish that I can see the museums that they build For example they keep a column with a man his shadow printed on it after the bomb happened . Finally I wish one day that I can have a lot of money so I can see this beautiful country.
