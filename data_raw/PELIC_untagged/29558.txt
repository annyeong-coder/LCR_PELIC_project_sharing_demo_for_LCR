I really like vegetables. In fact when I go to the supermarket I always buy 3 heads of lettuce a couple of pounds of carrots a box frozen of green beans 5 zucchinis and 4 servings of spinach. Since I also love desserts I always buy a piece of cake a wedge of pie a carton of ice cream and a gallon of milk so that I can always drink a glass of milk with my favorite dessert.
