In spring of last year I woke up with a shocking fact. The fact is about that someone died. It shocked not only me but also every Korean because the death is that a death of previous president of our country Korea. What shocked me much more is a fact that he died by himself. His suicide couldn't be accepted even if he had been had really hard work before he died by investigations on alleged lobbying incidents. Because people knew that he had great integrity and believed him. In the press it had been saying that his death was suicide until now. However most Korean thought that the press was concealing the truth. I also don't know whether his death was real suicide. I just have thought that he was killed by the present government.
