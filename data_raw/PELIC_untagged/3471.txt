In my point of view the traditional school can build students personality and behaviors then the using technology may build students' knowledge. So there are some of the effects between of studying at a traditional school and using technology to study at home. For the effects of studying at a traditional school students can learn what real life is and communicate with peers and teachers. For example when students went to traditional school he or she may talk with one's classmates because teachers may ask he or she to do the group workshop that makes him her must to talk and communicate with others students. Then during the traditional school life students will learn real life such as knowledge and behaviors from groups. For the effects of using technology to study at home that is virtual school. I think it is as assistant learning that can help students to learn more knowledge in specifically such as if you are interested on world histories natural science or arts you can use technology tr television to help you learn more. To sum up the traditional school using technology at home ought to use to students together to make more effects of building and creating their personality and behaviors knowledge.
