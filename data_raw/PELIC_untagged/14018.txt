Last summer vacation I went to Berkeley with a study group. I didn't know any one but when I took the airplan I talked to a girl next to me. After we talked we became friends and she even became my roomate. We stayed at Berkeley three weeks. In three weeks we have English class every morning. We visited Sanfransisco at afteroon. During the three weeks we also watched a baseball game it was my first time to watch the baseball game. I was many people and many vanders and I was really enjoy at the game. After three weeks we went to the Las Vegas and Los Anger . I visited most of the hotel in Las Vegas it was amazing. I also watched many free shows of the hotel. In Las Anger we went to the Universal Studio and Disney Land. It was my best memory so far. We enjoyed the firework show at the midnight. We saw the show with a lot of people it was romantic. I really like this trip. Hope I will have a chance to go there again.
