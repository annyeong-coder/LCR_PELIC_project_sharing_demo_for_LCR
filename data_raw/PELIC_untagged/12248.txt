After this semester After I finish this semester I will try to take the Toefl. When I get the Toefl I will try to get admission at university of Pittsburgh. Then I am going to take vacation I will visit some places in the United States. So until I get the Toefl I am going to improve my English language. But before I do any of those things I am going to take two weeks to relax in my home and I will enjoy my self when I get chance.
