Never ending story was a movie made out of the book Never ending story Both of them have the same title. That was a story about an introversive and lonely boy whose name was Bastian. He only loved reading books because he had no friends. One day he found a book titled Never ending story in his old house. He read the book and actually he left the real world and went into the book world called Fanthasia . When I was a child I was excited to read it. After reading I went to a theater with my family and saw the movie. I was very disappointed because the story was exhibited totally differently. The stories were totally different. In the book the story enhanced that how Bastian came back to real world from Fanthasia . He gained many good things in Fanthasia however when he got some good thing he also lost his memory in the real world. His friends tried to make him stop to gain things because Bastian couldn't come back to the real world if he lost all memory there. However Bastian resisted their attempt because he wanted to be stronger. On the other hand the story of the movie ended when Bastian reached at Fanthasia . The narration said Bastian did many things in Fanthasia and he finally went back home. That's it! The big elimination of the story reduced the deep meaning of the whole story. Moreover the excitement in the movie was decreasing because the story ended before Bastian began his long long special journey in Fanthasia .
