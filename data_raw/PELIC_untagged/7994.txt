Nowadays people in my home country Taiwan live an abundant and plentiful life. I cannot imagine a generation of turmoil where people would lose their belongings home family and even their own lives anytime and anywhere in their own country. During The Eight Years War of Resistance against Japan from 1937 to 1945 during World War II and then the Chinese Civil War in 1949 this was that happened to my grandparents. In 1949 they fled from the wars as refugees with Chang Kai Shek's retreating army from China to Taiwan. From my grandmother's own words starting from the time my grandfather joined the army to the time of the retreat to Taiwan my grandfather grandmother and their family members endured all the unimaginable sufferings and hardships.
