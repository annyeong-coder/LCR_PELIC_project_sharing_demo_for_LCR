There are a lot of people that I have been inspired by them but I've been most influenced by entire Mecca society. They influence can be seen in some different ways. First since I moved to Mecca I've been cultivated by this society's values. For example Mecca society is considered by the Muslim's world the host for the god's visitors pilgrims . I was taught to give better hostability. Second Mecca society is said to be the most frictional with the different nation. I was persuaded that who hold the god's love in his heart can easily to extend to love the whole people. Last but not least I'm still inspired by this society's believes especially by the way they respect life. They never cut natural trees or leaf or hunt birds in their sky or animals in their land. I was helped by Mecca society to understand freedom.
