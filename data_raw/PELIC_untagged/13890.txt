ELI will have a picnic. We need a lot of stuff to prepare. First food is the most important. We need a lot of sandwiches some pieces of ham some bags of salad and a little fresh fruit. Second we need some drink such as bottle water beer and soda. Third some plastic plates forks spoons and napkins are also needed. Of course it will be better if we have some potato chips. Don't forget cameras. We will get a lot of fun.
