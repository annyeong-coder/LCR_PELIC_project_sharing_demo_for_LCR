The decision of studying at the United States is followed by many questions and comparing processes. These are what is the best state what is the suitable city and which university I have to attend Beside these questions the student will make a comparison between the states and cities. As for me my decision was followed by some processes such as searching issuing the visa and planing my trip. Before choosing the city that city that I want to move to I passed through some steps. First I read about the United States in order to collect some Information to help me in choosing the suitable city. Then I canceled those states and cities which were not satisfied with my criteria. After that I made a comparison between some cities till I reached to that Pittsburgh is the suitable one. Finally I asked those who had been to the United States and they recommended it. After I chose the city I started issuing my visa. This process requires filling out some applications and submitting them to the United States Embassy in my country. I followed the roles and I completed all the procedures. Then I took an appointment form the embassy to be interviewed by them to see if I deserve the visa or not. After issuing the visa I began to plan my trip. Planing my trip passed through few steps. First I made a reservation online to travel with the Saudi Airlines. I confirmed my reservation by issuing the ticket. Then I plan my temporary staying in Pittsburgh by reserving a room in one of its hotel till I rent an apartment. Finally I prepared myself well before the appointment of the flight. I arrived in Pittsburgh and I am studying at one of its greatest universities which is University of Pittsburgh. Actually Pittsburgh is the suitable city for me and for my family. I advise all those who want to come to the United states to follow my steps to find the suitable cities for them.
