My room is the place that I don't have to care about how I act . When I WAS 15 my room was the place that I study training sport and eat . After high school my room was the place where I relax and study . Here in Pittsburgh my room is just the place I sleep in. Sleeping room is where do you really live so it always must be clean and organized .
