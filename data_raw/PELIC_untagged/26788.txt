The first time I have seen him was that I was guiding my students to do exercise. He was one of members in that student group. I didn't like him at the first sight at that time. One year later he became my colleague. After that he asked me to cooperate to carry out some projects that he was undertaking. While we were working together I learned many useful lessons from him such as time management labor distribution and team working. I felt happy and comfortable when we got along with together because he always respected my ideas and opinions. One day while I was typing the report I receive his message. It was not business message. Until now I have recognized that it was the turning point of our relationship.
