I prepare before writing to do many things. For example I clean my room and a surface of my disk. My own habit is to sit on a comfortable chair in my room. I also make some coffee. My clothing should help me relax so I dress in simple clothes. For example I like to wear pajamas while I am writing. My tools are important too. For instance I use my computer when I need to find some words for spelling and meaning. Also I enjoy writing in a soft light. When I finish to prepare everything I start writing. Sometimes it takes a long time. For example while I am writing I am thinking about words which one is better than the other. Although I make many mistakes in my writing I try to check them and fix them. Then I read carefully what I wrote. Finally I just take a rest.
