It requires several steps to plan for a weekend trip to another city. First of all you should choose what city you want. Some people refer to the Internet and others ask friends. I usually ask my friends because they are trustworthy. Next you should reserve a hotel. If you use the Internet you will get some cheap hotels and also the web sites provide valuable reviews for hotels. In addition I suggest you get a map from your city to there. I usually get a map at the AAA office or on Google. Finally if you prepare some food for the drive it will be a perfect trip. In conclusion these several steps such as choosing city reserving a hotel getting a map and preparing delicious food help your trip be fun.
