Is Learning English as a Second Language in University of Pittsburgh ELI a good place When you hear about this question you will think about it. However some people thought only traveled to English countries you'll learn English quickly and fast and they didn't care which kind of institute you'll be studying. As a result some of them may be failed or successful. From my prospective there are many reasons leading you to learn in the ELI. Initially I got many recommendations about the ELI that told me the ELI is a good place to learn English. My friend ANON_NAME_0 Saudi Culture Mission and Arabic Website all of these three things told me about it. For example ANON_NAME_0 talked a lot about teachers and they all of them are linguistics and more specialist who to learn non native speaker. In addition Saudi Culture said to me that Pittsburgh is a good environment to learn English because it has a big university and has a strong competitive to become a famous University. Moreover Arabic Website talked about books resource and material that is very helpful for students. The second important thing is the ELI website that I found a lot of programs effort by school. I found many things that I like and feel to need improving such as pronunciation program TOEFL program and so on. Also it has a strong resource like tow labs which prepare for students to help them in Speaking and Listening and it has many media available in the lab. All in all every international student wants to succeed in his life. If you want to succeed you can talk with your friend or surf website that will help you to find a good place for learning English as the ELI. I found the ELI a good place through I talked with my friend my culture mission and their website.
