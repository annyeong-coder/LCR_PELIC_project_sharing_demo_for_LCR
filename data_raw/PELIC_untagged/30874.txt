One of my friend wrote a letter to me and asked me to call on Simon Wheeler and inquired after my friend's friend Leonidas W. When I saw Simon Wheeler I told him I will deeply appreciate him if he could tell me anything about Leonidas W. Then Simon told me some tedious stories but I didn't interrup him. One of the story was about Jim Smiley who was the curiousest man because he was always betting on anything. If he could get anybody to bet on the other side and if he couldn't he would change sides. Jim Smiley most always come out winner. He bet on a dog fight a cat fight and chicken fight etc. He even bet his wife couldn't recover from sick. Jim Smiley had a slow mare horse and always helped him won money. He also had a little small bull pup whose name was Anderew Jackson. The bull pup was good at biting other dog's hind legs to win the game when Anderew was fighting. One day Anderew Jackson was bited die because another dog didn't have hind legs. Jim Smiley caught a frog was called Dan'L after 3 months training the frog could jump the highest than other frogs. Dan'L learned a lot of skills as long as Jim Simley taught him. Also the frog was good at catching flies. Dan'L was praised by a lot of people and Jim Smiley was proud of his frog. One day I stranger came to the town and Jim Smiley asked this man to bet with him. Because this man didn't have a frog Jim Smiley went go catch a frog for him. He asked the stranger to keep his frog during his leaving. However the stranger filled Dan'l a lot of quail shot and filled him pretty near up to his chin. Finally the frog couldn't jump and Jim Smiley lost 40 dollar. When he found his frog was filled a double handful of shot he went to caught the stranger but he never caught him. When Simon Wheeler was telling me this story a am yelled him. I thought it was impossible to get anything about Leonidas W. So I left.
