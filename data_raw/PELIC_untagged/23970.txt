Special place in my garden is there for three foreign chairs with a table of food. Every day I see the neighbors meet them drinking tea and some cookies. And beside them there are swings and slide playing with children and enjoy their time and the track when there is such a beautiful place by the tennis courts and competition between top players and next to the volleyball court a very large and beautiful floors colors and fun. Finally the basketball court a long and very broad in addition to parking for this fascinating place. I can see my kids as they play from a balcony of my house because it is overlooking the garden.
