When I was a middle school student I had an experience about money. I didn't get any pocket money from my parents. When I need some money I just asked my parents to get some money. I used to like to hang out with many friends. We usually ate dinner or lunch when we met in outside sometimes we just had tea. One day I spent too much money to buy many accessories so I used up my money. The next day I borrowed a little amount of money from one of my friends. After I faced the situation I started to manage my money. Even if I didn't get the pocket money I could have some money because some of my relatives who visited my house on holidays gave me some money before they left my house. This experience helped me to learn why I should save some money and how to manage the money.
