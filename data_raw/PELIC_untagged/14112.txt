First of all I think to take a decision to married some one who is from different culture is not a simple decision. I think you should think for a second time on your decision. Think about the reasons that made you take this decision if it only because you love him Do you think its enough reason to marry some one Don't think by your heart only . Use your mind. Secondly ask that person if he was in your situation what will be his decision Thirdly you should listen to your parents and their reasons to refuse this decision because they are the most persons who concerne about you and they have more experience in life than you . After all of these if you still think that your decision is the right decision try to talk to your parents and convince them. Lastly I think to take adecision that you think it will hurt your parents is not awise decision. Dear advisor I have a problem that I can not stop thinking about it.
