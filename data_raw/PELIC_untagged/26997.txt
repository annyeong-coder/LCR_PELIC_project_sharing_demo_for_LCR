When I was 10 years old my teacher brought me and my classmates to see a movie whose name is Mother. In this movie a young kid whose parent divorced many years ago was raised by his mother. His family is very poor. In order to make a better life his mother sold her blood to hospital for money. Being short of enough nutrition his mother got a serious sick. The life burden was put on the poor boy. He had to take part time job while he was studying in school. However his kindness and diligence did not make him lucky. He was rejected to enter a high school and it meant that he would not get a further education. His mother had to ask help from a rich people who embarrassed her and imposed her to do some illegal things. Lastly his mother was caught by police because of smuggling. After watching this movie everyone was deeply impressed by the tale . I will remember it for ever.
