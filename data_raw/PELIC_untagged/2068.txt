My Strength and Weaknesses as a Writer in English I think there is nothing more that I can write about. I'm going to write about my strength. First of all I can write a paragraph with a good grammar. Second I know how to spill the most of words in English. Third I can organize my paragraph as well as I can but not as a perfect writer. This is some of my strength that I can think about right now. The weaknesses that I have as a writer in English are when I try to write about something strange or new for me. On the other hand always I forget to use the new words that I gust have learned. In addition I write within limited time. For example in the Toefl test they asked me to write 300 words in 20 minuets it's really hard for second language. Finally when I write a long sentence I get confused to coordinate it with a perfect grammar. I hope to improve my writing with my new teacher Rob to be a profit ional writer in the feature.
