Some people are probably more successful in their relationships because they have the qualities essential to loving relationships. On the other hand the lack of these qualities is probably the cause of many problems we have with other people. Many of us would benefit from developing those qualities we don't have. For example many people get married and divorced over and over again also others don't get along with coworkers on the job. Therefore perhaps their lives would be easier if they were better at communication in other words if they were more honest about their feelings.
