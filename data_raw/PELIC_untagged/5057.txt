Main point If you want to enter famous university you should sleep 4 hours a day. If you sleep 5 hours a day you would be a communication student. So students want to solve their problems via wrong ways. Sometimes as an outlet for stress they annoy the weak and they steal some money from the weak but they don't feel any guilty to the weak. Next high school students have a lot of home works and tests. If they don't get good grades their parents will compare between an honor student and their children. Parents want their children to go famous University and succeed in their life but it is just parent's dream. Last of all I think that the school must teach to their student about human nature education and the society should be concerned about this problem. Parents should not give burden to their children and talk a lot of time with their children. It is better to make a counseling center in school and the student who has a psychiatric problem must meet a doctor because it is not a personal affair but the problem we should solve together.
