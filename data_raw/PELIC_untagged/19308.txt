In my opinion Love is the most important relationship. It is just not only love between you and your soul mate but also love between you and everyone or everything you like. Love always stands on everywhere and every time. You can touch or meet your love by using your gut feeling. When I meet that relationship I am always engaging my physiology such as hug or kiss to reach a peak emotional state. For example in the day that I left from Thailand to U. S. My mom came to send me at airport. Before we said goodbye my mom had hugged me. While my mom was hugging me I could touch my love relationship between my mom and me by using gut feeling. Therefore I was hugging my mom too.
