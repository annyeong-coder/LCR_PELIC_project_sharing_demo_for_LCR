I met my friend Jisu when I was going to New York City by the airplane. At that time she who is flight attendant was working in the airplane. We spent a lot of time together while we were staying in New York. First of all when we went NYC's Times Square we were walking around all day with shopping. After that we saw musical The Phantom of the Opera'' on Broadway. It was amazing that I still feel like hearing sound
