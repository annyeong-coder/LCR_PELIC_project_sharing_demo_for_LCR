If you are planning a trip to my home country I will give some advice for you. First you should go to the night market to eat some local snacks for example you could taste oyster thin noodles steamed sandwich and stinky tofu etc. Second you should go to National Palace Museum because it has many valuable antiques. The next you should go to our aborigine tribes you can find many aboriginal hand craft product. And then you should go to Taipei 101 this is the top building of the world. Another you should go to eat fresh seafoods because my country is a small island we have a lot of fishing port. Additional you should go to visit the temples we have many antique temples because my country is a Buddhism country. Finally You had better not to talk about the politics topic in my country because that is a sensitive topic and you had better prepare enough cash because we have many stores can not use credit card.
