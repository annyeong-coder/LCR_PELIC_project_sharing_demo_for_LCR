My creativity was created since I was in a primary school. It was happened when I took drawing class with one of my favorite teachers. Moreover my school had a drawing contest and the reward of the winner was a pencil box that captivated my attention so I decided to compete. At first I had a second thought because I did not like the contest topic to impose an idea on me. It was too specific for me to draw something I did not like. Besides I was not good at drawing and painting. Also I did not like to work under time constraint. However my favorite teacher told me that I could do it. Finally I got a second runner reward because I adapted the topic that the committee gave me with my own imagination. After I graduated from primary school I did not have time to draw and paint again because I have lots of homework to do. I had time to draw just in class so my creativity was wiped out since then.
