I would like to start a business in a creative way like Roddick did. Because of these unconventional strategies the customers will easily distinguish our products from other competitors. It is important to build the image of our company and our brand. By the way I would modify some strategies of Roddick's if I were going to run a business. Though most of the way that Roddick did was excellent and good for people especially her products are made from natural things. But it will be useless if we do the same thing just like all the other competitors did. In my opinion I will modify the strategies bases on my target market in order to make sure what we are doing will be noticed by our customers. But I will retain the environmental strategies Roddick made it is one the most basic rules to play a company nowadays.
