I cannot forget this experience when I was a sophomore in university 10 years ago. When a new semester started to begin I was supposed to play the cello in the orientation for freshmen. After I finished my performance I went to a bus terminal to go back home. When I arrived at the bus terminal I realized that I didn't have enough money to buy a bus ticket. At that time I thought I could withdraw a little cash at an ATM. However the ATM was usually close after 10 pm 10 years ago. Therefore I didn't have any money and was left alone at the bus terminal at 10 o'clock at night. There was not even any bus going to the school at that time. Thus I decided to ask a woman to borrow 20 for the bus ticket. When I asked her she looked at me with lots of doubt. She didn't lend me some money until I explained my situation. Eventually I was able to go back to home late at night with her help. I paid back 20 to her right next day.
