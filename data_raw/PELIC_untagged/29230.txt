When I told my father I wanted to study in the U. S he wasn't surprised. My father told me that he had studied in the U. S. And it had been unforgettable memory for him. Also he commented I should go there. I was happy to hear that and asked him what were the good point and bad point when he had been in the U. S. He responded that he could meet a lot of foreigner and know culture differences. That is why he respected their cultures and realized how he liked Japan again. On the other hand he claimed there had been racial discrimination and he had felt sad. He added that there had been a lot of dangerous places so I had to pay attention to those places when I went to the U. S. Lastly I said to him those his opinion had been helpful for me.
