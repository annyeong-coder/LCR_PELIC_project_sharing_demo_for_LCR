We must say Bismillah and wash our hands before the meal and say Elhamdulillah and wash our hands after the meal. We must use only right hand when we eat. If you are a muslim they are the most significant rules on the meal in my country. We believe that if we say Bismillah and Elhamdulillah the food is abundant and we also acknowledge food to our God. Before and after the meal washing our hand is very important to cleanliness hygiene and health. Also we never use left hand but I don't know why. I can remember my mother said I have to use righ hand when I was a child and when I was using left hand she angried to me. I try to teach them my children.
