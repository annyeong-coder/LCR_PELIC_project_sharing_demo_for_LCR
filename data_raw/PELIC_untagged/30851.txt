Thanks God it's Friday TGIF . This expression is used in the U. S. To express people's happiness in Friday but are people happy in Sunday as well Weekend days are different in some countries Thursday and Friday Friday and Saturday or Saturday and Sunday. However Friday in the United States is completely different from Sunday regarding to people activities and feeling and it is hard to find similarity between them. First of all the feeling in these two days is different. Even though Friday is workday and Sunday is holiday the grate majority of people are feeling good in Friday because it is the last day of the workweek and they are enthusiastic to enjoy the weekend. In my country which has Thursday and Friday as weekend days Friday is consider to be a religious day likewise Sunday in the United States. In Friday most people like to do indoor activities parties visiting friends and going to restaurants while they like to do out door activities in Sunday picnics and skating and so on. Furthermore people spend most of their time in work or school in Friday. In contrast they have free time for whole Sunday. As I said it is difficult to find any similarity between Sunday and Friday but I think that both of them are fun days is only the one similarity. To sum up Friday and Sunday have many differences and they almost don't have any similarity.
