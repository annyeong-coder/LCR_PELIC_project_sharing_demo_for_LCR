I don't like to live a nontraditional lifestyle. First if I choose to live a nontraditional life I will be ISOLATED with my good friends. Second I cannot live without Internet TV and Shopping Mall. I enjoy the city life very much. Even though sometimes I imagine to living a CAREFREE life and don't need to work study and responsible for my family I still believe I should PARTICIPATE some social activities that are good for my health and someone who concern me. Besides living a nontraditional life means I have to WITHDRAW myself from my current life. However I have a lot of plans for my future's life and I am also hard working for these so that I will not REJECT my fabulous life to SET APART FROM others.
