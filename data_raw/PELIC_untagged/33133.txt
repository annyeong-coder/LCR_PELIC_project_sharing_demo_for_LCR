Iam a student in university of Pittsburgh at ELI. I came from saudi arabia. I have graduated from king ANON_NAME_0 university since 2010. I have been in USA for five months . Iam still studying in ELI. I have passed low intermediate level. I haven't got high score in the TOEFL yet. All the classes are very interesting and very significant to improve English language. To be honest I have done well in writing section but I still haven't done well in listening and speaking.
