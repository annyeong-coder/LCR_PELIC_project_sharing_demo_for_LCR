I was born on November 8 1976 in Tokyo. My father and my mother were born in Tokyo too. In 1982 I began to learn swimming. I enrolled at junior college in 1995. I studied children education at the junior college. In 1997 I graduated from junior college and I got a job in a bank. I got married on July 7 2007. I left the bank at the end of July. And then I moved to Pittsburgh with my husband. I started to study English at ELI in 2008. My goal is to improve my English by the time I go back to Japan.
