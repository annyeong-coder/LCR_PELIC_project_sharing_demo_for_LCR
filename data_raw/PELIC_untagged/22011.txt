The name my partner is ANON_NAME_0 and she is from Saudi Arabia. Her name means insperation in Engish but she didn't know this until recently. It's difficult to say her name but she doesn't use a nickname because she loves her name. She lives in Oakland and she's studying English because she wants to continue studing towards her master's degree. She likes to watch T. V. Also she told me that she misses her country every day.
