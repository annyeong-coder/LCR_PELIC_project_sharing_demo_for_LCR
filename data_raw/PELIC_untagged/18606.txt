When I was a teenager in the Philippines I was an expert on snacks and fast foods. I was growing fast so the more I late the hungrier I felt. The street vendors in our town had better snacks than any else. In the morning I used to buy rice muffins on the way to school. They are sweeter than American muffins. After school I ate fish balls on a stick or adidas chicken feet . Snacks on a stick are smaller than American hot dogs and burgers but they are much varied. My friend thought banana cue banana on a stick was really great. However they weren't as sweet as kamote cue fried sweet potatoes and brown sugar my favorite snack. When I came to the United States I didn't like American fast food at first. To me it was less interesting less than my native food and less tasty too. Now I'm getting used to it and it seems more and more delicious. Does anyone want to go out for a pizza
