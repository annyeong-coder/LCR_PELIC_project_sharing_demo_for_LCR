My bedroom is very comfortable for me and it's sunny and warm in the winter. I do not like the sunny room because of the light makes me awake easily. I want to hang up a new curtain and move the bed around far from the window . I want to put up some lamps to light the room up. I sould touch the corner up because it's cracking.
