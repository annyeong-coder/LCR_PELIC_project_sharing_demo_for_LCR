I recently saw a movie named Is anybody there which was not very popular in the U. S. A boy whose mother runs a nursing home and a retired magician who stays there become the best friends. They go to a dark basement which belongs to the retiree and try talking to a ghost because the boy is so fascinated at the otherworld.
