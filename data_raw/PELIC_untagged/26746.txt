I used to live in Kaohsiung of Taiwan. I have been working for ten years and I used to busy. I had a full time job and a part time job. I never used to watch TV too much because I hadn't time. I used to listen music in free time. Today I am living in Pittsburgh and studying in ELI. I enjoy student life. I have more time to trip and relax. When I finish this semester I will go back to Taiwan. I wish I have a good job in the future. If I make enough money maybe I can come back.
