There are four persons in my roommate GiGi's family photograph. In the left her mother who is a manager in a telecom corporation sat in the sofa. Her brother Tony who is a college student now stood behind her mother. GiGi's father sat together with her mother in the front of the picture. My roommate GiGi who was sixteen years old in the picture stood behind her father and smiled to her brother. GiGi said she misses her family when she left home to start her college study. She left her family when she was eighteen years old.
