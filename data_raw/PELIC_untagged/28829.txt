Speaking in favor of gender is always debatable. Every gender has bias for his or her gender. Every side tries to persuade the other side that they have better abilities and features. For example it is said that nowadays most scientists and engineers are men. Although many people believe that there is no accurate scientific evidence which reinforces their point of view. For instance we can easily notice that many women successful in their career compete men. Furthermore many times women are the winning side in this kind of competition. May the main reason that many people believing that men have superior attributes is our society. Unfortunately we have been fed this wrong perspective since we born. This perspective is deep rooted in our community. Thus women have given up quickly. They had announced that they already lost even before the game started!
