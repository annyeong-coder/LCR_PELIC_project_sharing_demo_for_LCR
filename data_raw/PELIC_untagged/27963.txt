Technology advances happen so quickly in the modern world such that we are unable to assess the effects these technologies may have on our environment. One of the most imminent issues is the greenhouse effect. The majority of the technologies humans use on a daily basis relies heavily upon processes that emit carbon dioxide. These incredible amounts of carbon dioxide causes the greenhouse effect causing major climate changes. Major climate changes affects farming and many industries most importantly it may cause the extinction of many precious species on earth. Attempts on substitute energy are underway in many countries but I think ultimately it depends on each individual to cut carbon dioxide emission and energy use.
