Different people has different personaity types for me many times I find myself being a person who is both extrovert and introvert. An extrovert person is someone whose energy is activated by being with others. For example when I am alone at my place and have nothing much to do I will feel boring being lazy and a little depressed. On the other hand when I am at a party with my friends I will be very energetic and lively because I love to enhance my relationship with other people. However sometimes I feel that I am an introvert a person whose energy is activated by bing alone. For instance when I am at a party with my friends I feel that I want to fade away from the crowd. I often enjoy doing activities alone such as runnning swimming and shopping etc.
