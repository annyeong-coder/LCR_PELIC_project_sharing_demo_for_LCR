Here is a story related to money happened to me six months ago. One day last April I was walking and figuring where to have breakfast. Then I came across Subway. I entered and took my place in a long line. Then my turn had come up. I told the woman who was working there what I wanted. After that I waited in the line to pay . During that I picked up my wallet to get my card ready . I shocked that my card was not there. Then I remembered that my sister had told me the other day that she would take my card to charge the laundry card. She must forget to return it back. I asked myself what I should do now. I was run out of cash and I had no card and I had already placed my order. I started to get nervous. While that I fortunately saw one of my friends walking in front of the store. I got a big smile on my face and I left the line unconsciously and I ran quickly after her. I was so happy to see her. She noticed that. I had not been so happy to see her as much as that time. I told her that she had a great timing and she was my luck for that day and I asked her to lend me ten dollars. I was a little bit embraced. But everything went all right. Now before I leave home I doboule check not only if I have my wallet but also if my card is inside there.
