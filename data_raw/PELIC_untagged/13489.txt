Many people have friends whose characteristics vary differently. A best friend whom most of us hope to get is obviously different from other ordinary friends. The definition of a best friend who is very important for us is sometimes different in each country. In my country a best friend should help his friend who is in trouble. We also should talk with our best friend what we really want to tell. Anyway it's important for us to keep a good relationship between our best friend which is priceless and precious.
