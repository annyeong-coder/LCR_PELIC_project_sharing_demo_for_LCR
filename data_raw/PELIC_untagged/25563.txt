My country Japan consists of four big islands and many small islands and located in the east end of Asia. Historically Japan has had several cultural exchanges with Korea and China and developed its culture through these exchanges. There were a few ethnic groups in Japan until recently. We usually refer to the biggest ethnic group just as Japanese. Since it occupies almost all population we don't need any differentiating names for it. Traditionally there have been the Ainu and Ryukyuans besides the major group but their population size has been very small. Recently the number of Korean Japanese and foreigners who come to Japan as labors has increased. There is a variety of Japanese cuisine some of which have their roots in different countries. For example Japanese curry which came from India via England has some unique aspects and totally differs from Indian curry.
