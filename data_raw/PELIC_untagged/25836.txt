The causes of happiness Everyone desires to achieve happiness but the causes of happiness differs greatly for every individual. Everyone has things that make him happy. For example if we look at the poor people we will find them happy even though they are poor. There is also a rich happy so happiness does not differentiate between the poor and the rich. In my view happiness achieved for several reasons the most important reasons psychological comfort having close friends to you and smiling. First of all psychological comfort difficult thing to be achieved. So we find most people envy those who have this comfort. Because if you find comfort you found everything. Everyone has the psychological comfort you will find them happy. Therefore we don't find most of the expatriates happy because they aren't happy for psychologically they are not in their country. The treasure has freed mental happiness does not feel it when it is lose. Friends close to you are important reason for happiness. Because they do not make you feel sad or annoyance. Therefore you should choose friends because they will determine your life. A person happy you find his friends always happy. Accordingly a close friend may cover all your skeletons. Also a friend share most of the days of your life he knows how to makes you happy. Finally a smile brings happiness to you and those around you. Smile also make your age longer and make you loved by your friends. Hence the happy always smiling and this does not mean that all of the smiling people are happy. If you want to be happy smile to those around you. I believe that the smile and happiness with each other always create a happy life. So as I say to be happy there are several reasons that are psychological comfort close friends and smile. Whoever owns those three things you will find happiness.
