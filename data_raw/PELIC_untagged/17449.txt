Kristopher Hi! Jane. How are you Jane Great! How about you Kristopher Fine! I am planning a trip to your country Taiwan. Could you give me some advices Jane Sure. I think your first station is Taipei. Taipei is a modern and lively city you should go to Taipei 101 it is the world's tallest building. Then you should go to the National Palace Museum. There have many Chinese art and artifacts. The famous art is Jadeite Cabbage with Insects . And I remember you ever told me you want to go to Tamsui. It is a good place you should go. You can see sunset and eat Tamsui iron eggs chewy eggs . Next maybe you should ride a motorcycle on the Taipei's street you can see the local culture. This is a stimulated experience. You had better put on the safety helmet. Kristopher It's exciting. Jane Taiwan is an island there have dramatic seaside views. You should go to the Northeast Coast National Scenic Area natural seaside views special rocks and some of Taiwan's freshest seafood. You can't miss it. Most importantly you should go to the night market. Every city all has the night market and the famous night market is Shilin Night Market. There have Taiwan traditional snakes stinky tofu large fried chicken cutlet fried buns and oyster vermicelli etc. You should not eat too much in here. Taiwanese are friendly to the foreign friends. But you had better not say Taiwan belongs to China.
