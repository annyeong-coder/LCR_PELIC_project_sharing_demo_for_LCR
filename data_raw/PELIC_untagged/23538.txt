If I hadn't gone to Germany and studied there I would have studied in Beijing China. Had I studied in China I would have married early. Had I married early I would have been tired of being married and divorced with my husband. If I hadn't left Germany after I graduated I would have worked in Germany. Had I worked in Germany I would have married a German. Had I lived with my German husband in Germany I wouldn't gone home often and taken care of my parents. If I hadn't come to America after I graduated I would have worked in China. Had I worked in China I wouldn't have had good environment to learn English. Had I not spoken English I would have lost many chances. If I hadn't come to ELI I wouldn't have met so many new friends from all over the world.
