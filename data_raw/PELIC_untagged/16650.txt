Caming to the US big challenge for me my first week in Pittsburgh started with many problems. First I left my documents at home when I was go to registration. Without document I coudnt registrate. Second I lost my key when I was come back home. I called my friend run on he pick me up and he gave me his key. In conclusion I hade a terrible week.
