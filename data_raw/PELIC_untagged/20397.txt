Our group decided to take many items for this trip. First we have to have enough fresh water because it's crucial factor for life. We can't live without it. Second we should have some maps of the area so that we can know the area very well and find out the dangerous places in this island. We ought to have an ax so we can make some fireworks from the wood. The fireworks is important thing for one thing heating. I think cooking pot is also necessary stuff. So we will be able to cook easily. The last important thing is a book navigating by the stars. This skill is very important to know direction when we walk at the island. In addition it helps us to go back to our home by our boat. Finally We should take a lot of stuff but these things are only available.
