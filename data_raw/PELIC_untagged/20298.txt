Climate can have a big impact on a person's lifestyle. It can control the clothes they wear to the sports they play. A person should be aware that living in certain climates influences certain aspects of his her life. First of all the climate can determine the things a person buys. Weather is the short term changes in temperature while climate is the long term changes. Therefore a person who expects frequent sunny days and blue skies should not expect those in a place with a cold climate. A person who lives in a warm climate probably does not have to worry about buying many winter coats hand warmers or rock salt since there is a small chance that the weather will call for snow frequently. Besides people in warm climates wear different clothes from people who live in cold climates. For example a typical outfit for a man living in California might consist of a T shirt shorts and flip flops since the weather there is usually warm. However a man living in Alaska would probably not wear that same outfit since there is snow almost all year round. Finally certain activities can only be performed in certain climates. It is possible to do some activities anywhere such as swimming since indoor pools can be used even when it is freezing outside. This is not possible for other activities such as skiing. Skiing requires a cold climate with snow which cannot be found in certain places with warm climates such as Hawaii. In conclusion climate controls many things in life. Three things climate controls are things people buy what clothes they wear and what activities they do.
