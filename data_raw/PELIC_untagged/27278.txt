I would like to talk about places where I used to play soccer when I was young and my friends who played with me. Two places which were near my house were suitable for playing soccer. The first place was my friend's house whose father is a teacher. The other place was an empty yard located between two buildings. We were six boys all of whom I still friend with. We were in the same high school graduated many scientists one of whom is ANON_NAME_0 Khait.
