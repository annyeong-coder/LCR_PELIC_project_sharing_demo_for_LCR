Four years ago my family and I had a car accident. While my husband was driving our car was hit by a van. The person that was driving was been distracted for her baby. Our car was considered total lost and thank God no one was hurt in the accident. My kids were helped by the officers. I think that the police officers are well trained for this incidents . The person that was driving the van was questioned about the accident and after one hour we allcome back home.
