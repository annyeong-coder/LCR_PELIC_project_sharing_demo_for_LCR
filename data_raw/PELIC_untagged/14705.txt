My parents are the main reason in where I am today. When I was a child they were a great help to me. My father have me study math and science everyday and my mother make me learn language skills. They both were the best teachers I have ever had. Although they make me work hard they let me play with my friends and cousins in a regular bases. So They get me to learn how to differentiate between playing time and working time. At the end they helped me to be a successful man.
