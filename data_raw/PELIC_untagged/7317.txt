I have already traveled Europe. I went many countries such as France Germany Spain Italy Swiss and Hungary. However I have never been in Japan. Japan is close to my country but I haven't gone there. If I finish my study here in the U. S I would like to. I would like to travel the hole country. I have never been in Tokyo. Tokyo might my first city that I might visit. I would like to go to the museum. I have never seen the Japanese Samurai. Moreover I haven't met my uncle since 1999. He have lived in Japan for 8 years. I would like to see him.
