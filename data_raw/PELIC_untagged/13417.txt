I used to live in Japan. I was working as a nurse in Japan. In those days I used to go to hospital by my car because my work was irregular. Therefore I used to be lack of sleep. Today I am living in Pittsburgh. I don't work here because I am a student of ELI class. I usually go to school by bus. Now I keep regular hours.
