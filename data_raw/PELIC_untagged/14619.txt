To get a driver's license in my country you must reach your 18th birthday. You must go to a driver's training school. First you have to take an aptitude test such as an eyesight test a chromatic discrimination and an audibility test. Second you have to practice driving technique with an instructor at least 34 hours. You must not drive alone until you get the driver's license. At the same time you have to take courses on rules and practical skills. The courses last 26 hours. You can decide against the date of a timetable. You don't have to go to the driver's training school every day. Finally you have to take a driving test.
