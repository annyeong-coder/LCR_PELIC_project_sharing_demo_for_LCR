As a physical therapist in a tertiary hospital English was the conductive and correspondent language between staff healthcare providers and the hospital administration. By the time I work in the hospital I had studied all of bachelor's degree topics books and articles in English. In fact I have been practicing speaking reading writing and listening to English since 2002 academically and practically. Meanwhile in 2007 when I began working in the hospital I was practicing English with my Indians Philippines and Africans colleagues in many situations such as discussing about our patients reading their medical files and preparing continuous academic activities. Even prior to my working period I had been taught by native English speakers theoretically as well as practically in the medical laboratories.
