Living in a nontraditional lifestyle is indeed fantastic. There are some causes that let me say that. Firstly you can enjoy something different every day. Normally traditional lifestyle has approximately the same daily routine that is boring. So some people say I'm not CAREFREE . Secondly one you choose this lifestyle you carefully can acquire what you wish. It's easy to have an environment that is ISOLATED from noisy and interrupted surroundings. Consequently this atmosphere will be relevant to make your mode quiet and smooth. One more reason is the independence. Our parents and friends are asking us some responsibilities that we should do. Having a vacation for one week as LEISURE time regardless where the place is meanwhile you can enjoy by temporary freedom and you ensure the DISTURBING for a while will be forgotten. Finally nontraditional lifestyle is absolutely better than traditional style.
