I have some advice to give to new ELI students when they just come in. The most important thing is that please talking with native speaker anywhere. The second you might rent an apartment with native speak when you just come to USA it would help you get used to new environment. Also you should participate in ELI activities so that you can have fun with other students from different countries. In addition you should memorize new vocabulary as much as you can because building vocabulary will improve your lever higher. Finally please be friendly to other people around.
