Nowadays many people use copyrighted software without paying it they just download it from the internet. The piracy phenomenon is becoming very serious these days. In my perspective people should not download copyrighted material from the internet because the companies which published copyrighted software own the copyright the people who download the copyrighted materials from the internet might break the law and downloading things on the internet strongly influence other people who are in the same LAN especially the internet speed.
