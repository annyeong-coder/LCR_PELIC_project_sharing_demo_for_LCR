My country has many problems now days. One thing of them is over population in seoul which is the capital of s. Korea. Most of people who live in korea want to stay in seoul because of education city culture. So there's little fresh air in seoul. There's not much land which is green becuse people used most of land in seoul to build a lot of houses.
