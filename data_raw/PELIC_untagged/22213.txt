This preparation begins the first week of class in January. The first step that they realize is to chose a mini topic for each grade and then they prepare their own dance or presentation. After this they have to practice the songs that they wills sing on that day. And finally the whole school wears something green or something with shamrocks. When the special day arrives all the guests go to the school of course wearing something green. The festival begins with the dance of every grade there are eleven grades. Then the teachers present their dance. Next the people who work in the kitchen make a parade. Some of these dances are Irish dances but it depends on the mini topic. After all dances again every grade sing their songs there are different songs for each grade for example the smaller girls sing dear little shamrock eight grade sing if you are Irish and the biggest girls sing 17th of march .
