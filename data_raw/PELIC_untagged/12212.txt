I always have been a common people like any other. But one day 15 years ago I discovered that I had a special gift. This day when I woke up early in the morning I couldn't believe in the dream that I had had last night. My dream was very weird. I was seated on the green old sofa reading the Pittsburgh Times when in eyes stopped on the news about the airplane accident. The dream was so real that I remembered colors numbers and the worst 125 people killed. While I walked slowly to dinning room by my usual morning black coffee I was thinking about my dream. I took seat in front of the brown Formica table dinner when suddenly I remembered that my sister had been in Chicago since one week ago and she could be taking the fly to Pittsburgh to day. Immediately I called her but she didn't answer. I let a message in her voice mail telling my dream. Fortunately she didn't take the fly to Pittsburgh because she was late at airport and she had received my advice. Then she decided to fly the next day. At night when I was washing my clothes my phone rang. My sister was calling me. Se was out of breath. It was clear the she had been crying. She told me that I turn on TV and watch the news. I did. The fly in which she was listed this day had crashed a few minutes after taking of. I was astonished. My dream had made a cruel reality. The same color same numbers and 124 people death had been told by the reporter. After that I have had several premonition dreams. And two or three days later they happen inevitably.
