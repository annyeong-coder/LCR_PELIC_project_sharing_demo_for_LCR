I think the two important things we can learn from Caral in regard to other cultures are trading environment and located. Trading environment is important for a country which needs to exchange food with other countries. Like Caral they grew the cotton that the fishermen needed to make the nets and the fishermen gave them shellfish and dried fish in exchange for those nets. They can use each other's merits and live together at different places. Located is important too. If a country was not built up at a right location they might need to develop every things by their own and it is a hard work that there's no otehr countries to learn with. And they might not have enough food for all the civilian. They might need to trade with other countries for food. Like Caral they didn't live far away from another country. They could exchanged food and commodities for living. For the third one I couldn't find it. I just think that trading environment and located are the most important things we can learn form Caral.
