Personal success One of the things that I have been success did to learn ride a bicycle . One of the things that my parents taught me how in control of the direction and how to get on off the bicycle and asked me to practice ride Bicycle every evening for 2 3 hours more than 2 months . For example I would practice how to ride bicycle to turn left or right then turn back around a cycle and how to get on and off bicycle when it's running . The second thing that contributed to my success in riding a bicycle was that I received an old bicycle from my mother . The old bicycle had a low not high seat so I could easily and conveniently ride and get off the bicycle . The final things that contributed to my success to ride bicycle was that I had a good and strict bicycle teacher my parents . My parents would correct my mistakes and help teach me how become a successful bicycle rider.
