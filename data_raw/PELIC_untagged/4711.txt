I met my husband for the first time while I was visiting UPMC 2 years ago. He came to the airport to pick me up when I arrived at Pittsburgh. He guided me around Pittsburgh while I was staying here. It impressed me. We had a good time for one month. After that I went back to Korea we kept in touch while we were living in different countries. As a result we got married and I came here to Pittsburgh.
