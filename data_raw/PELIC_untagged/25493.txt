My first cooking started in this country when my friend wanted me to cook one kind of Thai food but he did not know about I never cooked before. Then I went to the strip district street because on this street has two Chinese stores and one meat store. I bought one bottom of fish source two bottoms of soy source one gallon of vegetable oil one box of black paper half pound of garlic half pound of basil leaves and one pound of ground beef. While I was cooking I began with add three tablespoons of black paper one tablespoon of fish source and two tablespoons of soy source into the ground beef all of them are being mixed by my hands. I cleaned my hands . Next I put 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil on a pan and waited the vegetable oil on the pan until hot and then I out one tablespoon of garlic and one teaspoon of chilies on the pan and break it. Next I add the ground beef on the pan and break the beef after that I add half pound of basil leaves and mixed them. This is beef basil. I brought it to the party and No one knows this is my first dish.
