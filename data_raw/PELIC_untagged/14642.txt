Yesterday I had the GMAT test in which result was not good. I should have studied more on the verbal section which helped me improve my score. I didn't spend much time preparing reading comprehension because I thought I might have got familiar topics. I could have practiced myself under stress. Anyway I should not have stayed late on the night before the test as a result I had headache on the morning of the test day. My friend told me that I had to take a rest due to tiredness from the test.
