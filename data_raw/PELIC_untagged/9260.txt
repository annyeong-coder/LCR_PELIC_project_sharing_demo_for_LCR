This film is named The Day After Tomorrow directed by Roland Emmerich. It starred Dennis Quaid Jake Gyllenhaal Ian Holm Emmy Rossum and Sela Ward all of whom in the movie show how to get through an environmental catastrophe which is caused by global warming. A climatologist featured by Dennis Quaid as Jack Hall proposed a theory about what will happen after global climate change. In the film it really happens and does much faster than human expectation. The Northern Hemisphere suffers an ice age and a number of people die. In order to rescue his son featured by Jake Gyllenhaal Jack with his two assistants one of whom sacrifices himself to save others in the course of heading for New York equips all protections used in the North Polar regions. After the severe weather passes they find his son and some survivalists. Finally the earth becomes clear and people rethink how to be friendly with the earth and protect the environment. This is really a good movie that gives us a warning of ecosystem. I strongly recommend you to watch it.
