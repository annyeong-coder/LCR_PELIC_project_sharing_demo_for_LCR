I was confined in an elevator for almost 30 minutes. This story goes to a few months ago. At that time my husband and I just arrived in Pittsburgh and moved into our current apartment. Because we had no furniture we ordered some furniture such as bed mattress desk and chairs. This accident occurred when the furniture was delivered. Two delivery men were moving my furniture. Even though the elevator of my apartment is very small the delivery men tried to move all furniture once. All furniture was pushed in the elevator. The elevator door wasn't closed smoothly because of the heavy weight but they closed the door by force. The elevator went up slowly and suddenly stopped between 4th and 5th floor. Unfortunately emergency button didn't work too. I called my husband who was working at his laboratory and he called the apartment manager. After 30 minutes the manager came. During the 30 minutes I was really afraid. The real problem was not the elevator but the tough guys! One of the delivery men was really tough. He kicked the door and shouted out continuously. However thanks to him I was able to escape the elevator. When the manager opened the door the elevator was still between 4th and 5th floor. I had to climb the high wall of 4th floor and escape through the small space between the elevator ceiling and 5th floor. I was not able to climb the high wall by myself. At that moment the tough guy lifted me up and helped me go out. After that however my furniture was still in the elevator. My bed and mattress had been locked in the elevator for 2 days more. Of course my husband and I had to sleep without bed for 2 days. The elevator recently stopped working again. Now it has been fixed for over 2 months. I don't know until when it can be fixed completely. The elevator is my pet peeve.
