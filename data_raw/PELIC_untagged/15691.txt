One thing cheers me up in the ELI classroom is the room color. I find out that color makes me very combfortable. However the room's lghit drives me nut so if I have chanse to change something I would like to change the light to be more bright. The other issue that pess me off is the curtain. It is not organized. Thus I would prefer hang up a new curtain. Moreovere there is one item in the classroom tick me off is the black bord. It is very old. For this reason I would like to turn down this bord and replace it with new one. One more reason makes classroom much petter is taking capinet off from the classroom.
