I lived in my country Korea with my family since I was born. But now I have been in Pittsburgh 5 month. I don't know yet very well about American culture but since I have been here I realized several things same and several things different between my country. I think there aren't big difference things between Korea and America lifestyle. Especially Seoul Capital of Korea and Pittsburgh weather are similar. The first thing I realized difference about attitude. For example if you meet someone who older than you in my country we can't call his or her name directly. Also even though teacher we can't call his or her name. We usually call her or him just teacher or call name and added teacher. Another thing especially when you meet someone at the first time if you see him or her directly it can be rude and it might cause misunderstand. And at the first time we usually greet each other to bow or shake hands.
