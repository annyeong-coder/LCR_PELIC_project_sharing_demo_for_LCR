When I was child I'm used to playing hide and seek. When I grew up I never played that again. Now I had been playing ping pong. I hadn't played the ping pong before. I had been exciting when I played the ping pong. I had watched many famous ping pong players in the TV. I had known the famous ping pong player in China named Yaping Deng. She had won many games before. Also she got many awards for country.
