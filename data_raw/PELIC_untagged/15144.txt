I started study piano when I was five years old. I had been practicing it every day before I went to study at university. I have learned playing piano more than 10 years. In the 2th Piano Competition at my hometown I received the honor of Outstanding Pianist . I have not been practicing piano since I came here. I've lived in Pittsburgh for one month. Actually I had given up studying play piano when I studied it for a year. At that time I though I was not interested in exercising and could not feel happy from playing. My mother did not blame me on the contrary she gave me one month for enjoying the holiday without playing piano every day. One month ago I changed my mind and found that playing piano is an important part of my daily life. Since then I have never had an idea of giving up playing piano.
