My first week in Pittsburgh was very difficult. Because it was the first time in my life I travelled out of my country. I arrived to Pittsburgh in November and it was very cold because I had not enough clothes. Then I could not find a good apartment so I lived in a bad apartment. In addition I did not know how to use the buses and I often lost my way. Finally few weeks later I got used to this city and I overcame these difficulties.
