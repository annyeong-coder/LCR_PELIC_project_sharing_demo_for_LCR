One of my friends informed me of a good restaurant in Pittsburgh. I went to there with my friends. The restaurant served Italian and traditional American dishes. I ordered a cup of water and a bacon sandwich with a bowl of corn soup. However I couldn't eat them all even though I was very hungry because the food was very salty. One of my friends who were with me gave a piece of advice. Song drink some water whenever you take a bite of the bread and a spoon of the soup. I thought the food had so many spices including salt in it. So I was full before eating them all due to drinking water.
