There are strange people in the USA the Amish people I met them on their area are a good example. I went to their village in Pennsylvania and saw a lot of strange things I didn't see any cars and there are lots of horse cars. I went to someone's home to ask him about there life they were wearing the same clothes and not there any electricity. Then I wanted to take a picture for them they refused take any picture. Next I wanted to phone my friend they told me there is not any phone here. Finally when I wanted to leave they were very kind but I didn't believe there any people as Amish people.
