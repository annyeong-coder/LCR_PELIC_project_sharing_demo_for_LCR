I think anyone can create art not only by trained artist. Art is in everybody and everywhere. For example you just unconsciously paint on a paper and someone see your picture and he says Your picture is so art. Although you are not trained before. I think trained artist different from people who are not trained just know more techniques and have more skills about how to make art. For this reason I think anyone can create art.
