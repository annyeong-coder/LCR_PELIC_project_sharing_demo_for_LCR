2. I fell down and hurted my knee. I was in pain and when I tried to reach the sofa to stand up my lesgs were shaking and I fell down again. Finally I could stand up I went to the kitchen and put ice pad on my knee and come back to my room to take a shower. 3. I was riding my old bycicle and suddenly I felt that I was flying! A big stone stopped my front wheel and my bycicle goesin one way and my body in the opposite direction. Thank God I went into a garbage conteiner so I did not hurt myself. I jumped off of the conteiner and walked at work. 4 She was so angry because she was waitting for me to have a meeting and I did not arrive on time. I apologized myself and explained her all the things that jus happened to me before I arrived al work but she did not wanted to hear about it. She told me that we were late with our work and we started working with the most urgent thing.
