About two years ago my friend ANON_NAME_0 and I was following our scholarship program. We had to go to the student sector We could have gone by air plane to our capital city Tripoli but he bought a new car and asked me to go with him to Tripoli about 1000 km from Benghazi city in which I work we went to Tripoli and we asked about our papers and when we came back we arrived to Misurata my birth place city and where my parents house is it was night I asked him to stay that night with my parents and we have to drive 800 km to Benghazi. He refused the idea I was really upset he said it might be good idea but we should spent the night driving to be there in the morning after 50 Km while he was driving there was a died camel in the street and a big truck coming from the opposite side he was confused and suddenly found himself either to go over the died camel or he will hit the truck. He was driving over the speed limit and he hit the truck and it was terrible we have been injured and it was bad accident. But ANON_NAME_0 have got the lesson he shouldn't have been drove over the speed limit. Also We ought have gone to my family's house. I might have seen my mother. Now I can't travel at night at all this is not only because my sight but my mother will never forgive me if I do so all this after that accident.
