Sleeping is most important action to human being. We need time for relax to our body and mind. We spend our daily life in the situation that too stressful. We are in the series of tension traffic jam in the morning pressure of parents or girl friend exams etc. Our journey of tension can be ended by sleeping. We need the time to restore our will of life. But some people might say sleeping is useless. Because when people sleep they can't do anything but sleep. Further more they might say human beings spend one third of life time for just useless sleep. Their thought is that instead of sleeping they can do anything more in consciousness. However here is the thing they should know that our body system is optimized to sleep. People sleep when they feel tired. It's simple and natural. If we act against to law of nature it's going to be long way to restore. For example imagine you're experiences. Probably most of students would have same experiences. One day after party out all night long you definitely need time to sleep. Sleeping is need not only for the clear consciousness but also for your body health. It's unchangeable rule. I would rather sleep than do something in feeling of sleepy. Again it's the way of human being live. Without sleeping we can do nothing.
