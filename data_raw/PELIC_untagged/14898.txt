There are a lot of things to do in my weekend. My main plan is to go to Water Front. I want to get heater and small table for computer. Recently it becomes cold day by day. Second I have to clean kitchen and bus room. But I don't want it. Finaly I want to sleep a lot. I hope there is no homework for writing.
