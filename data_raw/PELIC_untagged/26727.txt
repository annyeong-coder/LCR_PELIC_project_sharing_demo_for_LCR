When I moved to Hangzhou I met my best friend Ling. I met Ling while I was studying high school. I moved to Shanghai when I graduated high school. I moved to Shanghai while I was studying the college courses. I backed to Hangzhou when I graduated the university. When I backed to Taiwan I found my part time job.
