When I was in the 4th grade of elementary school our grade particpated in a painting contest. I got a prise it pleased me and gave me confidence. My painting revealed my dream I wanted to fly in the sky so though I was ashamed I thought I was acknowleged that not only my painting but also my dream were great. Ironically this killed my creativity. Because I was caught by this and I became not to be able to diversify. That is after this I made some paintings and handicrafts those described flying. So I'm ambiguous whether I agree to contests or disagree to it.
