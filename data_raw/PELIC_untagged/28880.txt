Dear Sand I realized your dilemma. In my opinion you should tell him about your feeling for the relationship between you and him. He might be also in love with you but he might not be sure that you have the same feeling for him. After you tell him your thought you could discuss the next step that whether you should move there and live with him or not. I think that he has not asked you this question because he has had to adjust to new life in the new environment. He might ask you to live with him after his life is stable. If you really decide to move there you should consider quitting your present job and finding a new job there. Anyways you should make sure that you will be happy and not regret it by doing this. I wish you have a good life! Sincerely Chatty
