I think we had better take matches because we can use matches to start a fire. With a fire we could get warm and cook. We also should take a knife. We can use a knife to cut food or something else. A flashlight also is very important. We could move in darkness if we have a flashlight. Besides these three things I think we must take a tent. We can sleep in the tent.
