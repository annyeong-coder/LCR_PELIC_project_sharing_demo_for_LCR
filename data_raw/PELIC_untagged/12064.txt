I have lived in Pittsburgh for 1 month. I am come from Bundang. While I lived here I found some similarities and differences between my hometown Bundang and Pittsburgh. There are 2 similarities such as the road and doves and there are 3 differences such as traffic the weather and transportation. I want to talk about similarities between Bundang and Pittsburgh in this paragraph. First the road of both cities is almost the same. Pittsburgh has avenue and street. Likewise Bundang has similar system like that. Because of that I could find the direction and adjust well in Pittsburgh. Second Pittsburgh has many doves on the road and Bundang does too. I hate to see doves on the road and I am afraid of them. I used to avoid meeting them in Bundang and I am doing same things in Pittsburgh. Although they have 2 similarities they have differences more than similarities. First the traffic system is different. In Pittsburgh we can't turn right when the red light is on but in Bundang we can. Because of that I was a little confused but I am fine now. Second the weather is different. In Pittsburgh the temperature is approximately 34
