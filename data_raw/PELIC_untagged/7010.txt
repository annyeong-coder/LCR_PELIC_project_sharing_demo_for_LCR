Now I want to introduce one of my friends who lives in Seoul. I met him in the high school which is placed in Seoul too. He has a twin sister who looks like him and we used to meet together. Because house that he lives is near the our high school I used to visit there to spend time. There is a guitar which I borrowed to him I taught him a couple of times. Actually Kim has hobbies which is similar to me. We did many things that we are interested together. Recently I heard that he made a new girl friend who is model so I hope that I meet her with my friend as soon as possible.
