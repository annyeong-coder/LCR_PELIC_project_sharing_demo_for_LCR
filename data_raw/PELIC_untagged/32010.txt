When I was child I had played with my neighbor's friends. Before I entered elementry school I had learned most Arabic letters. I had been studying in elementary school for 6 years. Before we moved to new house I had graduated from elementary school. By age 15 I had learned swimming. I have swum since then. I moved to U. S. A in 2011. I have been studying English since then. I have been learning new things besides learning English.
