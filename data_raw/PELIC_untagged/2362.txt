When surnames began appearing in Europe 800 years ago a person's identity and occupation were often intertwined. A surname was a direct link between who a person was and what the person did. For instance Taylor is the Old English spelling of tailor and Clark is derived from clerk an occupation of considerable status during the Middle Ages because it required literacy. Also the names Walker Wright Carter Stewart and Turner indicate occupations. A walker was someone who cleaned cloth a wright was a carpenter or metalworker a carter was someone who drove a cart a steward was a person in charge of a farm or estate and a turner worked a lathe. Moreover one of the few occupational surnames reflecting the work of women is Webster which refers to a female weaver.
