First of all decide on a destination. Because it's a weekend trip you'd better pick a nearby place. Then check schedule weather and costs. Especially weather it is one of the most important things. If you plan a long trip you may have a problem because you just have a couple of days. Just imagine during the trip that it is raining all day. It's awful. Later search for the destination. It is one of most important parts of the trip. If you prepare your trip you can feel more excited. Before leave your house check that the door is locked turn off the lights and gas. At last leave your house and have fun.
