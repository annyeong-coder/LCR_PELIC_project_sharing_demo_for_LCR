Let me introduce how to manicure nails. First of all wash your hands and apply some hand cream. Second use the equipment of cuticle removal to remove your cuticles. Next apply a base coat of nail enamel. After that apply a colorful nail enamel. Last apply a top coat of nail enamel. If you soak your hands in water for a while a nail enamel is quick to dry. You can make nice nails. But if you do it often it is not good for your nails.
