The English Language Institute ELI is a good place to study English as a foreign language. I would like to point out three major reasons for that. First because students in the ELI come from more than 14 different countries all over the world each student has to use English to communicate with each other. If most students came from a single country students would likely speak their own mother language to communicate among the students. In this case the English progress of the students would be inhibited since they would lose their opportunity to speak English. I can make friends from many countries and I can get opportunities to speak English Mila a current ELI student said. Second the activities off campus offer the students many opportunities to learn English. In fact there are many activities in the ELI and the activities are just on the increase. Finally the ELI has not only a single course like speaking but all English learning courses including speaking listening writing and grammar. This is an important point to note that taking all these five courses could lead the students to fair and non biased English progress. Actually the largest group of the students 66. 67 Took all courses in the same semester. For these three reasons it is naturally led to a conclusion that the ELI is one of the best institutes to study English as a foreign language.
