If I become school president I will change an atmosphere of the class. Our class is too boring. I'll make our class interesting. If I run for a class I will ask for allowing to eat or drinking in the class. Aren't you hungry when you are in a class We are starving. Then if I become school president I will ask to let a TV wit DVD player in the class. Don't you want to see a movie in the class It will not be boring in a restime. And if I run for a class I will reguest computers for each student in the class. We will learn more if we use a computer. Last if I become school president I will ask for changing all the chairs in the class. Isn't it un comfortable I'll alter to comfortable chairs
