I was trying to install a Mac system onto a PC. In fact mac system does not officially support PC. However since Apple started to use Intel CPU for their Macs the hardwares in a Mac and a PC are exactly the same. As PC is not officially supported I need to find information and certain softwares to help install a mac system into a PC. I was totally lost in time and enjoyed a lot doing it. I would consider that was 'flow'. Indeed I felt that I have created something. Eventhough other computer geeks on internet have done this before and I did it with their help I still feel the pleasure of being creative. I felt that I made something and that brought me the joy of creativity and success.
