Home cooked food has more advantage in my view point. First you can eat in home and meet with the family around the table every day. To talk with children wife in order to know their problems or happiness. Brazil has the culture where the family eats together every day. Also the home cooked food is healthier. Brazilian people who have custom to eat in home does not have problem of obesity differently of United States. To illustrate this affirmation a nutritionist and author Lisa Young says that fast food can lead to long term health problems such as obesity and heart disease . Based on that information I believe that home cooked food is the best option.
