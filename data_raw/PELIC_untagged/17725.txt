Divorce is one of the biggest issues facing the families over the world. We can note this problem obviously. However the causes of this phenomenon are different from situation to other . We can divide these causes in to background and mentality. Everyone has his her own background and it affects his or her personality. The difference in the background usually causes divorce. In this pointe we can show the couples who come from different background often they do not have the same way of thinking. The other factor difference in the background could be the reason of disagreement about many points even if it is not important. Also couple who came from different backgrounds sometimes will not get on well easily. The dissimilarity on background usually causes divorce. The couple who has different mentality most time they will not get in well easily. Sometimes the man is easy going but the woman is very stubborn or the opposite. While one of them is generous the other one is stingy. Whereas one is selfish the other is not the same. We can incorporate other cause. For example one of them very active and he or she likes traveling and participating in many activates on the other hand the other one is completely different. From my perspective if you do not have a lot of things in common or you is not compatible couple you should not get marriage. In conclusion the causes of divorce are not obvious enough to clarify. From these points we can point to several causes of divorce for example background personality behavior and culture. To who wants to have a good life give yourself a chance to have well knowing each other before you get marriage. After you got married you must not put the divorce in the tip of your solution's list.
