October 27. I've been on the Canary islands for three days now. I'll start home when the weather is better. I was so surprised when I picked up my mails today. My family sent some birthday presents to me. My birthday is the 31st. October 29. I think the weather is getting worse. I heard thunders today but there wasn't much rain. Typhoon and I stayed in bed. I started reading Brave new World. October 30 I left the Canary Islands today just like columbus. There's a strong wind and plenty of sunshine now. I went 250 miles. October my presents. I got much perfume and some pretty silver jewelries. November 1st. The electricities are low. I'd better save them until I get near land. I'll need the radio then. So I collected a little water for cooking.
