This year in my city town a lot of stores have been getting more expansive I have been visiting a few of them. The food has been changing and the people have been eating healthy food. I have been driving to work for hours traffic has been getting worse. I have been looking to rent a car the price has been changing and now they are very expansive. Friends of ours told me that the local council has opened two beautiful play ground. The weather has been changing during the summer people have been suffering from the hot weather.
