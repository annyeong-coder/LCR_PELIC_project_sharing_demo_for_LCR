Yes the use of emoticons is becoming a mania when we use MSN or Facebook. I used to run MSN and Facebook everyday. When we talked by MSN we use a lot of emoticons like o . . . Etc. Because sometimes a emoticon speak thousand words. It means that you don't have to have to key down a lot of words to explain your feelings one emoticon is enough.
