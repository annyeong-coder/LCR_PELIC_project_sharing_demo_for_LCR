How your bedroom reflects your personality 1. A 4 L 5 W m2 romm 2. A desk and a chair close to the windows 3. A clean bed with white sheet My room is not large but quiet enough for a student like me it only about 4 L 5 W m2. I prefer simpely hence there are not exceed items in my bed room. When you walk in at the very infornt of you there is a desk and chair against the wall by the windows. On the desk there is a notebook for use of study. In addition my recreations communications and my interests suvey are all depend on my computer. At the right side of dest my bed stays there and welcom me every night. It is a clean and singular bed which is cover with white sheet just like my personality I wnat it simple. I believe that if we keep our life simple and decpline we may able to gain more power to achieve something impossibile. Besides simple bed room make it to be clean more easier hence having a simple bed room yields more time for us to do someting. At least we could have more time to rest. So it is a smart and benefit decision.
