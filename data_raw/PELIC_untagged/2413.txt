World events such as economic cycles international meetings political conflict or terrorist attacks have notable influence in tourism. For instance during recession in the economic cycle all companies have monetary problems for that reason they have to lay off their employers and with unemployment people cannot travel or take a long term vacation because they don't have enough money. In addition international meetings affect the tourism positively for example the World Tourism Organization WTO meetings have as a consequence important decisions about how to increase the tourism in all regions of the world and how to benefit the tourist. However there is a factor which affects negatively the tourism a political conflict. This is the case of some countries in Africa or South America. They have a lot of interesting and beautiful tourist places but the political conflict and the bad international image don't permit foreign to travel to these place because they thing that isn't a safe place for them. Furthermore terrorist attacks affect negatively the tourism. After 09 11 of 2001 people are afraid about travel by plane and visit important tourist places in US. Finally even though recent world events affect the tourism I think the predictions of the article continue be true China United States and Europe will be the places most visited and with more revenues.
