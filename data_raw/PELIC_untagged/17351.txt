I live in a three story house in Irwin Pennsylvania with three other people five cats three guinea pigs and three hermit crabs. I like it when I get home from school I can sit down on the couch take off my shoes and relax. It makes me happy that the house has lots of windows that let in sunlight and fresh air. Having so many animals and the people in the house can always cheer me up. I like to pick up the cats talk over my day with my housemates and help with household tasks. I throw out the trash straighten up the rooms and do laundry. If I could change something about my house I would tear down the wall of my bathroom to have more space. Overall I feel lucky that I ended up with a beautiful house and kind housemates.
