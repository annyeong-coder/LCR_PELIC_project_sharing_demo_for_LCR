I think smell plays a part in how people choose their mates is reasonable. According to the text it says that every person is born with a certain odor type which is dependent on his or her immuno type. If people have different odor type their children born as a result of their union will inherit two different immmuno types thus bolstering their natural defense systems against disease. If people have the similar genetic make up the chances of miscarriage will increase. For these reasons I think it is reasonable that smell plays a part in how people choose their mates.
