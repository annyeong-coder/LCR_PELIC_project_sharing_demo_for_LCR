I have a favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. It is a Korean restaurant which is called Oishi. There are several reasons why Oishi is my favorite restarant. First It has lots of Korean dishes and some of Japanese dishes. I love Korean food but also I like Japanese food too. Second Oishi's host is Korean another staffs are also Korean. When I miss Korean I am used to going Oishi. Most importantly All Oishi's menu are popular to everyone. I've never seen the restaurant is empty. Although this is a Korean restaurant many American enjoy it. One of my friends who is from Russia likes Bulgogi which is on the menu in Oishi. For these reasons Oishi is my favorite restaurant.
