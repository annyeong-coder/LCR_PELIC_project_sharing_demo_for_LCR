Water is one of the most critical problem for humans. Human's body is composed of water thus we need to drink water everyday for supporting existence. If we couldn't ensure the clean drinking water our existence will be endangered. People feel clean water is an important resource for humans was from drank polluted water then got sick. First reason water was polluted is industry development. Accompany the industrialization people started to use chemical frequently such as agricultural chemicals plastic products chemical stain etc. Also in order to manufacture industrial products a lot of factories were built. Factories exhausted smoke caused air pollution then caused rain be polluted the polluted rain permeated then polluted ground water. Second using agricultural chemicals caused extensive damage to the ground water too. Chemicals permeated into soil then flow into ground water and polluted the water which we drink everyday thus we drink ground water was contained a lot of chemical things and some people got sick from drink water. In according to scientists' research found if pregnant woman drinks polluted water will increase to deliver unhealthy. Also people who live in poverty countries or areas tend to drink polluted water and get sick. I think that using chemicals less and educating people how clean water is important for humans will help to ensure clean water.
