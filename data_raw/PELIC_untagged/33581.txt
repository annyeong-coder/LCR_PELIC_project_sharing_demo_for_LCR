Terrible Weekend Last weekend was a terrible weekend . I got three apoientments in the same day. All of these were birthdays of my classmates. I spent alot of time to think where will I go should I go to the first invitation or shouid I go to the biggest party after that Idecided to go outside and never represent any of them . After I went outside I met an old friend since the primary school and I stayed with him up to night . The day after everyone of my classmates asked me why you didn't come then I said 'I can't please everyone'. One of my classmate got the same condition with me but he could represent in all of these invitations. When I asked him how could you do that he told me I spent half an hour in each party . Then I said It was hard and tidous why you did that . Then he said 'You Can't please everyone' but I just tried to do.
