I have many funny stories but I am wondering if they will be funny for other people. I am telling you one of them. When I was in the elementary school we had a week at the end of each year we called it the educational week. I believe that this story happened in the last they of this week. I was coming out in the front of the school where all students sat waiting for the manger. I did not know that the manger was walking behind me. I was waving to the student and trying to show off then suddenly the manger pushed me and I fell down in embarrassing way. The fact that this story was embarrassing impressed me negatively in that time. Then I got over it and I found that it was funny story. This is my story and before narrating it I was wondering what I should tell for you.
