Text 3 The Only Way Out On Saturday April 26 2003 Aron Ralston ride his bike and climb the rocks just outside the Canyonlands National Park in southeastern Utah. Unluckily one of 800 pound rock trapped his right arm. Four day later he cut his arm off in order to survive. Lastly he got a help from a Dutch family who were hiking out of canyon and he's live.
