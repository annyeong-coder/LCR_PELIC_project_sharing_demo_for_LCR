Ten years ago all my brothers an I lived in the Ivory Coast with my parents. Since then my brothers moved with my father to the neighbor country. I chose to stay with my mother and we met the rest of the family once a month. Unexpectedly my mother felt pregnant again and approximately 9 months later my little sister was born. Now we still a separated family but we continue to talk to each other every days via Skype.
