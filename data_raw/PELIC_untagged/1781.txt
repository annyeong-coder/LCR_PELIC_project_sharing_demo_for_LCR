In the University of Pittsburgh at the Cathedral of Learning there are many rooms which have the qualities of specific countries. These rooms reflect the culture and custom of there country. Among the rooms we visited two interesting rooms the early American room and the Syria Lebanon room. They have a lot of differences and some similarities. The most obvious differences in these rooms are the decoration. The ceiling floor and chairs of these rooms have a lot of dissimilarities. To begin our comparison we can see that in the early American room the ceiling of the kitchen living room is of heavy pine beams handout . It is very simple and it is not high. The bed room usually is on top of it. On the other hand we have a much decorated ceiling in the Syria Lebanon room. It is high and it is full of colors and carving that reflects the time of that room and how much Arabs love decorating their rooms. The second point that is interesting in these rooms is the floor in the Syria Lebanon room it is white marble and it has fascinating small pieces of red marble that are shaped in an Islamic design. Unlike that room the early American room has a wood floor which is not available in all houses. The wood was expensive that is why it was found in the rich peoples' houses. The third different in the rooms were chairs the chairs in the early American room were a long table and two benches whereas in the Syria Lebanon room was very nice sofas that are built in and that surround the room. These striped red and white satin sofas are attractive. They look very elegant. Finally we notice that there are a large number of differences between the early American room and the Syria Lebanon room which represent wealthy families' houses. We made a brief comparison of the ceiling floor and chairs in these specific rooms. These are just two rooms among many rooms which are small symbols of their countries in the Cathedral of Learning in The University of Pittsburgh.
