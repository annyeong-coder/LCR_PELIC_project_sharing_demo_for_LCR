I HAD GOTTEN my master degree a long time ago. I HAD BEEN DOING research work for many years. I HAD SUBMITTED 2 papers for a professional international conference in 1997 and both of them were accepted by the conference committee. One is for the oral report and the other is for poster. I HAD NOT Gone abroad in that year.
