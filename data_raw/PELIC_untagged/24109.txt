I'm looking for my ideal home with a quite neighborhood . I like to have a big yard and contains of fragrant roses . Also be a large bedrooms with impressive colors and integrated kitchen . I would like to be there a place to relax fully after working day . I love to be there an enjoyable living room with a large TV to watch the most beautiful movies . Also I like to be there a high balcony but it is important to be a cheap cost . In my opinion the most important thing for the beauty of the ideal home contains a family dominated by intimacy and love.
