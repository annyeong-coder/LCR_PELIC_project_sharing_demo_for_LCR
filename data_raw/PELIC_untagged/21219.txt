I have a goal to achieve before I go back to my country South Korea. This goal is to gain a good TOEFL score. Studying English in the US I have only goal to speak fluently. In these days however my husband has suggested to me that I take a TOEFL test. If we go back to my country next year I will be reinstated again in elementary school. My husband's thought is that if I had a good TOEFL score I could have taught not only my students but also teachers in English. Even though I do not have a good TOEFL score I can teach my students in English. TOEFL is a very popular way to prove someone's English ability. After I finish this semester in the ELI I would like to focus on TOEFL study. It is of course not easy for me to study TOEFL while I act my roles as a mother a wife and a Sunday school teacher. I am so happy to have a goal which I would like to accomplish. I will do my best studying hard.
