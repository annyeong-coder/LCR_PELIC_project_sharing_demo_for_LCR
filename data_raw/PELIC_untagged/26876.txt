I saw a movie which is called 300 . 300 Is directed by Zack snyder who also directed Dawn of the dead. It was a movie which I loved when I was in army service. The movie is about war between spartan most of whom are raised for soilders and persian. It is very cruel but exciting. After watching the movie which impressed me I could feel braveness.
