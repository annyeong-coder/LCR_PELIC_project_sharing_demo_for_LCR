In conclusion the numerical models are not the exact reality but they could give us a good representation of our reality. The numerical models are tools that we must manage. If we neither control nor understand these tools the results will be wrong. Models were the conceptual tools of scientists in the past now we can continue using the same tools jointed with computational tools. This group of tools gives us goods and development to our society. I conclude that numerical methods are the representation of our conceptual reality.
