In my opinion friendship with different personalities can change from one person to other. I think friends should have similar personalities but not necessary to have exactly the same personalities. Firstly I have a friend whom has the different personality than I have but we are still the best friends. Another reason for friendship with a different personality is to have diversity of opinions and exercising different perspective which are not similar to mine.
