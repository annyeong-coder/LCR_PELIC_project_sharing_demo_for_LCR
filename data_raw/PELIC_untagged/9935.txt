My Website Hello everybody I am Mali I am 29 years old and this is my web page I have been writing this page for present myself. For a long time I have been vegetarian because I love animals and I couldn't deal with the fact that an animal was killed. Also I am a nature lover I have 4 dogs in my home town and when I was there I participated in many campaigns Pro Animals like campaigns from Green Peace. I worked for 3 years in a retail company in Chile. But now I am interesting in study English so I moved to Pittsburgh and I have been living here since January 1 st 2008. I am enjoying my time in here Pittsburgh is a peaceful city and It looks very beautiful when It is snowing. I hope that you can enjoy my page I added a few photos of me my family friends and of course my dogs.
