Fridays and Sundays Each day of the week has its own attribute. Monday is the first day of the five business days and it is the day when most people feel uncomfortable returning back to work or school. Saturday and Sunday are the days of weekend for students and most workers. For me it seems that Friday and Saturday are the days of weekend. In Friday morning my weekend starts. On that day I feel exciting early because I know that I have some interesting activities. Usually with a couple of friends I organize my activities on Friday. After classes I go with friends to restaurants and hang out with them until evening. After that I go home and access the Internet to chat with friends in Saudi Arabia or watch movies online. These interesting activities continue on Saturday. On the other hand Sunday is the least exciting day. On that I just stay home and start doing homework and study for the next week. As you can see for me there are a lot of differences between Fridays and Sundays. Also I think they do not have something similar except the number of hours which is 24 hours that existed on every day.
