I read a book named 'Halo The Cole Protocol'. The book is based on the XBOX game Halo it's written by Tobias S. Buckell. The book talks about a war between human and aliens it's called human covenant war and it's also known as the Great War. The war takes place at Halo Universe. The leader of the United Nations Space Command UNSC is Captain Jacob Keyes. He leads human to fight against aliens. During the war they enacted a command to prevent the covenant from finding the location of earth or any other core world location.
