Last weekend I went to Washington DC with my girl friend. We don't have vacation so we can't spend much time there. We stay in Washington DC for 4 days. We took bus because we don't have a lot of money so we spent 13hours in the bus. Our bus delaid 2 hours on Friday. We arrived a hotel at 3 A. M. We were very tired but we never regret our traveling. Washington DC is very fantastic city. Washington DC looks like peaceful and comfortable. Washington DC has a lot of attractions that are I ever seen attraction on TV. I met Korean friend. He act as a guide for us. We took a lot of pictures. We think Washington DC traveling was a good memory. If there have been a few more time I would have seen a lot more beautiful scene. Finally I wish I could visit Washington DC again.
