Miss Hannah was living in a little house alone for more than 20 years. She liked planting asters in her garden. Although she was a poor and living away from other neighbors she believed that her brother would come back soon and brought her money and built her a mansion. One of her friends Jacob did not believe her and hint her that her brother might not come back with money. Even he thought he would not live anymore. No matter what others said to Hannah she always believed her mind. In the beginning of November Hannah's brother finically came back. However he was poor and unhealthy. Hannah was still quite happy because she thought she could look after her brother and was not going to be alone anymore. That made Jacob curious because he thought Hannah would feel disappointed.
