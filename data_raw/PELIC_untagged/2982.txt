Pilgrims in Saudi Arabia have many jobs. They usually wash cars at gas stations. For example when people stop to fill their cars pilgrims come to wash the cars and people give them money. Also some of them work on farms. Most pilgrims' income comes from sales. For instance most pilgrims are street vendors so they sell clothing houseware notions and cheap scraps in public places. Most pilgrims don't have houses to live in so they sleep on the street. Some of them especially women live in hovels or small rooms. Hajj is one of the five pillars or central duties of Islam. It is a set of acts of worship to be performed in and around Mecca at least once in a lifetime by every Muslim satisfying certain conditions. In these specific days pilgrims come to Saudi Arabia from many different countries to do the Hajj in Mecca. So when they have finished the Hajj they don't go back home. They stay in Mecca or go to another city in Saudi Arabia. After three months since they came their visas have expired. In this case they are illegal foreigners. And if so they stay live in different cities in Saudi Arabia and they can't get to social services.
