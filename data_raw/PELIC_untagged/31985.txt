Hi. I'm Gabriela Donaduzzi and I am from Brazil. While I was in my home country I used to dance ballet. I have been practicing since I was 6 years old. By the time I had 10 I had already done 7 ballet presentations. Before I finished High School I had been teaching children for a year. Last year I did my final presentation in my city. Ballet is my hobby. I have already tried another kind of hobbies but none got me like the ballet.
