The best description of my personality is that I am someone whose traits are combination of many of those. Sometimes I find myself someone who likes to be with others and other time I find myself someone who wants to be alone. I think I am intiutive more than sensor as intuitive people are those whose feeling is the gauge for judging things. My best friend who lives in Saudi Arabia and whose life is quite busy likes is a thinker. He tends to make decisions based on objectives. Those people who are categorized as thinkers are really hard to be persuaded.
