The text is talking about the widespread of English and its influence on other languages. The author mentioned in this segment the ties between individual freedom and political power which means that every person should have the right to communicate with the people in the way he she like. It shouldn't be required from anyone even the law to speak a specific language. Then he talked about another important aspect which is the relation between linguistic and social and economics mechanisms by mentioning this point he wanted to say that language play a major role in communication between people and that is what he mined by social side of language. Therefore we notice that every society has its own language like in India or Canada they speak in the same country different languages. Also economic mechanism plays a role in your language choice because it could force you to learn languages in order to do business or to understand the way things change especially stoke market international business. Finally he mentioned the rules that every culture choose as a way of communication and it could be different from group to another even if you live in the same country or the same communities for example in Lebanon even though Arabic's is the official language many people speak French in order to feature that they are well educated and it's also an indication of high social level. I think language is a way of communication and the goal is to use this language in ways that help us understand each other.
