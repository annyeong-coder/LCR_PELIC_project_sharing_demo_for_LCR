Ad for HONDA CARS In general I think this ad for HONDA CARS is an effective ad. Characteristic 1 Product illustration The illustration is typically a picture of the product. However it shows extent of interior space in two ways. One is just the picture of car interior and another is the picture of leading many people with some baggage and pet to the car. The ad tried to emphasize car extent. Characteristic 2 Simple language The copy uses shot simple sentence and exclamation point ! . Examples are HOP! STEP WGN HOP! STEP UKIUKI . There appeal to us because crooning and understanding are easy for us. And there are seemed to get the car easily for us. Characteristic 3 Call to action They give us clearly how to get in touch with them. Examples are phone number Web site and price. If we want to get more information we could get it easily. And we could drop by there when we went to near the store. Characteristic 4 Tell the truth They give us information about size color and type. The copy also gives us information that is authorized the Ministry of Land as economic cars. My country has big problem of environment pollution because of car exhaust. It would be one of the good points to choose a car. Characteristic 5 Offer something for Nothing The ad offers some free products such as spare tire machine tool and jack. It's more effective because it's important or useful to custom even though it doesn't have a lot of value. These fee products are useful for us to drive a car so a car and free products are in harmony. As stated above I think that this ad has power to gather many people in there.
