One year ago on of my friends told me the problem between her and her boyfriend. I remembered I didn't like her boyfriend because I think my friend can find a better boyfriend than that guy. I think I should have told her about my opinion about her boyfriend but at that time I just heard about what she said I didn't give her my opinion about that guy. I should have told her that her boyfriend didn't work hard in his work and I even could have told her that her boyfriend seems not a honest person. But when my friend and I face to face talked about the problems between her and her boyfriend she cried so serious thus I didn't tell her my opinion. After that date my friend and her boyfriend magically overcame those problems which she told me but unfortunately they still broke up six months ago and my friend was hurt a lot. I think I ought to have discussed about the behavior of her boyfriend sincerely. I shouldn't have listened what my friend words but not given the some opinions. But how can I give her a cruel judgment since she was so upset I think I still ought to have told her what I thought after she calm down that might be the best way for her.
