The last movie that I had watched was HANGOVER . It is so funny and the story of this movie is talking about four guys went to Las Vegas where they face a lot of problems. These four guys consider the main characters. One of them is a school teacher and the second one is a dentist while the other two people do not have jobs. When they get there at the hotel which they have already reserved before they started drinking much wine during the night. Because they drink much they became alcoholics and they did many trouble things without consciousness. In the morning one of the two guys who they do not work disappeared while the other three could not find their friend. In addition the man who works as a dentist found out one of his teeth was pushed out. Actually they could not remember what was happened last night. They found that they stole a police car and the dentist got married. Finally the found there friend after facing much difficulties and they came back to their city.
