SUMMARY Leone's restaurant was opened by Rose Leone in 1996. She was cooking and cleaning but before 2 years ago she was in coma. While she was in coma his son Micheal was substituting her. However he could not handle this restaurant and he did not care of it so all the employees did not work well. When Rose came back she shocked so she decided to call chef ANON_NAME_0 to fix what his son did. Chef ANON_NAME_0 decided to meet all the employees and he asked them about the problem. Trudy said there is no management. After that he asked them to cock all the meals in the menu. Next he asked chefs to taste what they cooked because these meals were terrible. When customers knew that chef ANON_NAME_0 was in the restaurant they came to eat at the restaurant. However chef ANON_NAME_0 knew that some ingredients have been since last Thanksgiving so he decided to shut down the restaurant. After that he took some pictures of dishes for restaurants that are close to their restaurants and asked them to compare between them. In the kitchen Chef ANON_NAME_0 surprised that Michael has not cooked. Then he reduced the dishes in menu and added new ones. Also he changed the decoration in the restaurant. Finally he launched the restaurant and all of them did well. Vocabulary words Overdue not done or paid. We owe 2000 for the meat overdue last month. Last month 2000 is overdue for the meat.
