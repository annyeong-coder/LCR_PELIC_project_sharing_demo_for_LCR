Writing is a process that involves three steps. First of all the first important is prewriting. Prewriting is the thinking talking reading and writing you do about your topic before you write a first. There are two ways to warm up before you write. In the first reason is brainstorming. Brainstorming is a quick way to generate a lot of ideas on a subject. Your list can include words phrases sentences or even questions. In the second reason is clustering. Clustering is another prewriting technique. It is a visual way of showing how your ideas are connected using circles and lines. Second the second step is writing your paragraph. When you write the first draft of your paragraph use the ideas you generated from prewriting as a guide. Finally it is almost impossible to write a perfect paragraph on the first draft. This step is called revising. There are several ways to revise your paragraph. First Add new ideas to support the topic. Second Cross out sentences that do not support the topic. Third change the order of the sentences.
