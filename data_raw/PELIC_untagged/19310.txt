When I was a high school student I had a bad experience of drinking. One day I was so drunk. It was my friend's birthday so we had a party together. Every friend was already drunk but we had wanted to drink alcohols much more. We ordered two pitchers of draft beer it was approximately 3 000ml of beer at that time. Nobody controlled to drink them. Time was gone fast I must go home it almost was over 1am. I was trying to call a taxi but I could not take a taxi easily. I just took the last subway in order to go back home. While I was sitting on a seat in the subway I suddenly fell asleep. After getting off the subway I went back home safely. The next day I realized that I had missed my purse last night. I was so embarrassed because there were a lot of cash in my purse. I called the lost and found office in the subway station. They seemed like to be unconcerned about my purse. I shouldn't have drunk a lot but it had already happened. I could not tell my parents anything it made them really frustrated. I never find my purse so I just recognized I lost much money. During three months I had been saved my pocket money to hide my lost money for my parents. It was hard to hang out with friends without enough money I assured that I would never be drunk again for myself. I think it was a helpful experience for me.
