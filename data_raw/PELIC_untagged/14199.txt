I have a good friend whose name is You Jin. We have known from a study group that was for preparing a job interview. Although I have many friends whom I met in school most of them are totally different from me. However You jin shares similar characteristics with me. For example we have a same goal which become a flight attendant and both of us like to sing a song. So after finishing study we usually go to Karaoke which is located in downtown. We get rid of a stress that has been gotten from study. Now I am going through many difficulties so I really miss her.
