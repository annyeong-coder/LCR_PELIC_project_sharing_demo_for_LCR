I think my son and me are much better than me. A few days ago I went to Pitt Zoo with my son after lunch. I had a receipt for me and my son from Rob. I showed her who check ticket. Surprisingly she was upset when I showed my receipt. She told me what is this This is not the ticket which available for Zoo At that time I just knew what am I wrong because my receipt was not ticket to enter the Zoo So I just remind I did not get the ticket from Rob before a day. So I just explained her something about situation happened to permit for Zoo beside my son. After a few second she thought little bit and saw my son. She said Ok go ahead If my son were not be there I was afraid of telling our situation and decided to coming back without any looking in Zoo. Also I could not enter there. Sometime I got a motivation and no fear to demand something to do for my son.
