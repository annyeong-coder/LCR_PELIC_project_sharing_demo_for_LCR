Men can Have More Authority than Women in Taiwan Thesis statement Women should be highly respected in this society. 1. Some people think women should not be a boss or a president however I think women can consider other's situation or to bend the rules to accommodate. 2. Some women who live in Taiwan must yield obedience to her boyfriend or husband even male colleagues but I think everyone is equal and we accept the same education so women can express their thoughts and ideas as well as men. 3. Most men think that women should take care of children and do all family matters. In fact I think they should share responsibility for chores because both of them need to work.
