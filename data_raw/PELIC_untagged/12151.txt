I worked for Telecommunication Company for three years it was from 2000 to 2003. By 2003 I had had another chance to work for Waha Oil Campany which I am working for. Before I made a decision I had made a comparison and contrast between these companies. The comparison and the contrast were on two aspects. They are the average of income and people who I should I work with. The most important aspect which many people looking for is the average of income. Actually I am getting a monthly salary from Waha Oil Company as the same as I go from the previous company but in Waha Oil Company I am getting other features such as a car free gasoline and a mobile phone. In result I can say that the average of income which I am earning from Waha Oil Company is higher than the one I earned from Telecommunication Company. The second aspect is the coworkers who I should work with and see everyday. Since the coworkers can affect on your success in the job I decided to work for a month in Waha Oil Company before leaving Telecommunication Company. I found that coworkers who I worked with in Telecommunication Company are very friendly and helpful but on the other hand they are careless about their mission in the company. However coworkers in Waha Oil Company are very serious about finding good results behind their job which I always look for. In addition they are friendly. TO sum up I am sure I made the right decision about changing my job to Waha Oil Company because I have found most of aspects which I like to find in my job such as satisfactory income and friendly serious coworkers.
