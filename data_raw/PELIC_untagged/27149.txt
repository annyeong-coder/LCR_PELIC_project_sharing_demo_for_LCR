Drugs Drugs are the most common disease that destroys the person's life. The drug's affects the person life and change it upside down. The cause that leads to this problem is family person and community. The family is the most important step that the child takes everything from it. The bad methods that the parents use it is usually leads to very bad results. So the bad raising and the lack of monitoring of the children lead them to go the wrong way and it's mostly results to drugs. The second important thing is the person personality and how he chooses his friends. As everybody knows that the friend is the major of every person that people see you from it. Therefore every person should choose the right friend. If the person chose the right friend he will be so far for these bad things. Finally the community has also a major role by providing more ideal model school classes. Therefore the student will know the effects of it to avoid it and to give more attention to the media. To put short clips of previous adductors to give advice not to try or to be close to drugs. I think that the drugs are common dieses that effect many people and lead them to the wrong way. I hope that every family takes care of their children and every person must choose his friends wisely because they will help him during his journey in life.
