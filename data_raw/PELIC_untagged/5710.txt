This article is about poor children who have to work. In the world today more that 2 3 of all children have to work to help them self and their families. Their lives are difficult for following reasons they work hard they work long hours they do not work in safe places and also the work that children do is not safe. Sometimes the children are sold to someone else to work. Often the pay is very low and that is less than one dollar a day. Although this is a big problem some people try to help these children. One boy form Canada has a dream to help these children by writing some letters to the government. A government official looked at this problem. Then the government official advises education as the solution. For example one boy form India rescued form his work he lives in a shelter and learning to write. Child labor is a big problem but there is a young boy and government are working to help solve this problem. In my opinion children should be studying and be having easy life. However I think that children could have a smell and easy job or volunteer because they can learn about life and they also learn about spending and saving money. Do you think so
