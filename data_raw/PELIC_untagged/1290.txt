Across Embroidery From 3 years ago when I was a teenager I started to embroider . First time I just tried to do it result was my works a little ugly since then I tried it many times it became better and better . How I did it First I saw a picture that designer already draw it I saw the picture and embroiderd on a specific fabric on the fabric have many same distances small holes . Second I just needed to use different kind of lines crossed the holes . Third you do many times the same action it can become a beautiful picture . Maybe you will think it's very easy but you need know the holes are very small and you do all day but you just can see a little different than before and you may feel backache and feel you eyes very tired because you need pay attention on small things and continue it long time . If you is a girl and you like quite and you can sit in one place long time and you like beautiful embroidery you need try it .
