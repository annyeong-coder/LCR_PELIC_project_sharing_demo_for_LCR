I would say that I strongly believe that being creative in school is necessary for many reasons. First of all being creative means that the child will come with new thoughts and idea instead of memorizing. As a result of this he will explore his way of thinking which will help him in the future. Another reason is if the child is creative in particular discipline this might be his career in the future such as being an artist musician or athlete and so forth. In addition being creative could be a sign of being interesting so that the child will like his school enjoy going to it and wake up on the morning with enthusiasm.
