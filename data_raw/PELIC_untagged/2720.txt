The Challenge There was a friend of mine who got a chance to go to the United States to get a college degree. He was living with his family but he had to leave his family and go to the U. S. He was working for a company and registered for a government scholarship but he wasn't serious about this challenge. However he got a confirmation about his scholarship. Meanwhile he was hesitant about taking this chance there were people encouraging him while there were others that didn't encourage him. For example one of his friends told him to take this chance. This friend told him that after he graduated he would get a better job. On the other hand there were others who told him if he took this chance he would regret it. They added that if he left his job he probably wouldn't find another one that easily. He was really confused about leaving his job and his family and going to the U. S but he knew that it was a great opportunity for him. Finally he decided to leave his country and go to the U. S for a couple of reasons. First he would learn English. Then he would get a Master's degree which would help him to get a better job. When he arrived there he experienced a lot of difficulties because it was the first time that he traveled by himself and the first time he was responsible for a whole apartment. At first he didn't know how to cook so he had to get used to the fact that he needed to cook. Next he wasn't used to leaving his family for a long time so he had to put that fact behind him if he wanted to get his college degree. From the beginning of the semester with all these difficulties he always wanted to quit college and go back home. The one thing that kept him from doing that was that he thought about his future and how he'd be a success after he graduated. In the end through good and bad times he graduated with a Master's degree and went back to his family. They were very proud of him. He got a better job and became a success.
