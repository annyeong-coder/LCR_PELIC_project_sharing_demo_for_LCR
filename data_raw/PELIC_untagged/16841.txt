I think that this is a good idea because I come up with 3 reasons right now. First internet dating helps a person to know oneself. Because when he or she introduces oneself he or she has to organize what is one's individuality what is one's desire and what can give up about other person. Second this is a chance to meet with another communities. Especially if he or she has never loved a person around him or her the value of chance is big. Last this way is easy come easy go . Because parting is easy he or she can meet with a lot of people easily. Therefore internet dating helps a person to find oneself new worlds and a lot of meetings.
