When I was 8 I was fat. Since then I have lost weight. When I was a child I lived in a village. Since I became adult I have lived in a city. When I was 7 I had eyeglasses. Since then I haven't had eyeglasses. When I was a child I was shy. Since then I haven't continued to be shy. When I was 14 I had long hair. Since I graduated I have lost my hair.
