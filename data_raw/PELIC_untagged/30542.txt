Every body in this life have a way to live in this life and which determines that is the person and his environment. So I will talk about myself in fact I like to live CAREFREE life which is all of it happy life absolutely like any human. About the question what I understood from it if I like to do some thing new or I like routine. So yes I would like to live a nontraditional lifestyle in my opinion the nontraditional life is more happy and you could do everyday something new. I think when you live traditional life you will not do something new in your life you will stay in same place ! In addition people who like to live nontraditional life always like PARTICIPATE and don't like ISOLATION . Also people who like live traditional life they always reject in the community because they are limited thinking they always do the same thing so they don't have experience.
