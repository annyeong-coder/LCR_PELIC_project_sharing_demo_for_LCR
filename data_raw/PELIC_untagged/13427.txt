Generally if I want a really good meal I cook it myself because I can have it exactly as I like it. Something about the sweet sour or miso favor is a cup of my tea. In addition I love cooking new dishes according to the online recipes because every new dish seems like an adventurous experiment for me. Thus I know I've had many best meals in my life. Several months ago my best meal I've had started with a table of family style Taiwanese dishes and an interesting novel with pieces of classical music at home. I had a wonderful miso soup sweet sour pork chop over rice and some shrimp Lo Mein and a cup of Green Tea with milk while reading that intriguing novel. I gorged myself on all that good stuff which could not only satisfy my body but also my mind. The drink the food the place and the music were all perfect. Everything tasted like foods made in heaven even that hardcover novel! Sadly I cannot afford this kind of luxury dinner at home recently because I get too many hours worth of homework that I have to do every day.
