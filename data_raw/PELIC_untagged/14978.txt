About a month ago we all went to Pymatuning State Park with my friends. We had unforgettable times. Actually the weather was frigid but it is worth to be there with my friends. There are a lot of cabins and we rented one of them in which we spent a good time. As I said we came across with the frigid weather and at several nights we made a camp fire and surrounded it to make a friendly conversation. Some of them offered to go to the lake that is locate in the camping area. It was exiting amazing. O my god. . . Entire of the lake was frozen it was marvelous scene. We felt as a challenger and tried to walk on the lake. It was cool but also dangerous. We had been there for 6 days. We prepared different kinds of delicious food and enjoyed. At the camp nights we watched movies that we retrieved priorly. Along with that in my opinion the air in our lungs replace with Pymatuning's air which is clean and unique. All of us were glad to be there. It was another good time of my life.
