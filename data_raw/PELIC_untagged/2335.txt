I will talk about home alone movie I love this one. The boy in this movie hoped to be alone without his family . By the time they had been preparing to travel to Paris to celebrate the christmas there they had forgotten about him . When he wokeup at the next morning and discovered he was alone he was so happy and he had enjoyed his time . By the time he had been preparing the christmas tree he had heard two people spoke about stoling his house so he prepared every thing for them. As soon as they arrived he had been waiting for them and he had a lot of fun and protected his house.
