One of my favorite dishes is Russian okroshka . From the first sight Russian okroshka looks like soup. However it's not boiled and is served cold. This dish includes many different components. Among them smoked meat boiled eggs boiled potato fresh cucumber etc. All thees components are cut. After that the Russian beverage cold Kvas should be to pour into this mix. Kvas has bitter and sour taste and is similar ti alcohol free beer. Okroshka has smokey and fresh smell. It has light brown color due to kvas. I like to eat okroshka in summer because it's light and refreshing.
