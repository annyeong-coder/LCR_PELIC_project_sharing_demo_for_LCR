There are many important things I learn in this semester. First of all I improved my English for speaking writing grammar and listening class. For example in the writing class I knew how to write essay very well and how to organize the essay. In the grammar class I understood many instructions. For example verb tense phrasal verb and gerund and infinitives Second I met many different students from all over the world. I met with people from China Korea and Japan.
