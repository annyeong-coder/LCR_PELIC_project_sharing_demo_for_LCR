From my point of view if tourism were to double in the next 20 years this will be so beneficial to my country. It will generate a lot of job opportunities in the sector of transportation restaurants lodgings tourist guides and the like. This will also eliminate the ambiguous image of my country toward the other world and will in turn enhance the relations between our own culture and other different cultures. Tourism will help stabalize the economy as well. To sum up tourism is becoming one of the most crucial elements of modern industry.
