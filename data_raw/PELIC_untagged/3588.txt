Everyone has a favorite weather. It could be sunny cloudy windy or rainy day. In my case I love rainy day. I especially like to hear the sound of raindrops. Whenever it rains I want to hear that sound which could be made when raindrops fall on the window or the grounds. As Euihyun said it's really good time when I'm sitting in a chair and watching the people out. So I could leave out my stresses or worries and could just think of nothing. Thus I could feel relaxed. I agreed with that ANON_NAME_0 said the rain makes the sky so beautiful. The sky with fast moving clouds looks like soaking up my mind so that I feel swirled into it. That is why I enjoy the rainy day. However someone doesn't like it because we could get wet and feel cold as ANON_NAME_1 said. They are right but if they forget about the physical response to the rain they might feel good as I did. If I say that the rainy day is beautiful it might be inconsistent. However the more we feel the real rain the more we could enjoy the rainy day.
