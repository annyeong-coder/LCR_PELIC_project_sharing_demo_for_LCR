I'm a perfect client for Itunes store because I listen to different kinds of music!. First when I want to be relaxed at night I listen to classical tunes because it has a calming effect. Also I listen to bossa nova music in the morning because it is essential to start the day with inspirational music. Finally I prefer to listen to pop music when I do excersice. Although most people find it annoying and boring for me pop music is lively.
