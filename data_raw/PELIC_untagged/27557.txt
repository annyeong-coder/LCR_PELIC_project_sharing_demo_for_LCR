I want to study grammar to figure out English sentences. And I want to talk over grammar rules with my classmates so I hope to find out rules of grammar. Actually I didn't figure out all phrasal verbs so I would like to go over that. Grammar is one of the most difficult part of English for me but I don't want to give up. I think my grammar ability counts on me so I'll study hard.
