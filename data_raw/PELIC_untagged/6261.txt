Mr. ANON_NAME_0 Please look at the classroom it's so terrible I want to give some advices to you to improve the situation. First and importantly you had better not let students dirty the classroom you should ask them to keep the classroom cleanly. Second you should repair the copy machine. Third you ought to empty the trash. Fourth you should add more computers that every students can use if not you shouldn't let students to employ the computer so long. There are many things still need to change I hope you can improve them as soon as possible.
