I believe that women are better parents than men and I will give my words to advocate my opinion. Women spend lots of time to take care for their children. For example I remember when I was 5 years old my mom was always fed me and and washed me. Another reason that deserve some words is women have high feelings than men. For instance if I cried or when I fell from my bike immediately Mom who hold me and hug me. It is true that men can take care for their children and and feed their children. However men do not have the high experience like women and they do not have the high sensation like women. At the end women are butter parents than men.
