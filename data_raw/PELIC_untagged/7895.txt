As I rushed down the stairs to eat a quick breakfast I tripped over my cat and I fell down. After I stood up and went to kitchen room I took a cup of coffee a glass of milk and serval chips of bread. When I put the bread in the toast oven it didn't work because it just got broken. I had to eat the cold bread. I na hurry I finished my breakfast quickly so that I could catch up with the time I was not too late to work. On my way to work I decided to take a shortcut through an old part of town. Ususally it can save about 10 minutes so that I could be on time to work. Unfortunatelly there are traffic jams in the old part of town. What happened My god maybe other peoples met the same problem of being late so that many cars were crowded on the road. Time past quickly when could I got to work I worried. When I arrived at work I found a note on my desk from my boss. She wanted to see me right away. I took a deep breath and walked into her office. As I stepped inside I noticed a scowl on her face. Why are you so late today my boss shouted at me. Don't you remmember what date is it today Oh I am so sorry for being late because She couldnot help listening to me. It's the last day to hand in your technical report. There are many data should be updated. Our expert David wanted to talk with you on these data this morning but you were late. So you had to finish it yourself. Remmember all should done before 4 clock. Back to my desk I didn't eat lunch to catch up with time and finally I finished at 3 59 and handed in.
