Dear the U. S. President Hello. I am writing a letter as one of your precious citizens in the U. S. What I want to tell you is obvious discouraging tobacco industry in the U. S. And outside America. After reading the article I was disappointed with the work of The United States Trade Representative USTR . Even though I already knew that their supporting to smoking I didn't take the problem seriously. However it is time to cut off helping the tobacco companies promoting cigarette abroad. Retaining profit from cigarette is important as a part of major industry but imposing strong trade restriction on other countries especially Asia countries is not a good idea. You need to tell people all around the world that smoking is bad for health and if it is worse you would die because of various kinds of diseases caused by both smoking and secondhand smoke In addition to that you should control the sneaky way of tobacco advertising overseas. They do lure young people to smoke using fancy advertising or brand stretching. People don't know the underlying meaning of the logo in any product such as sports and clothes. I hope that you can deal with the problem in a right way. You are the only one who The U. S. Citizen depend on. To save the world and make the place better we need your strong action.
