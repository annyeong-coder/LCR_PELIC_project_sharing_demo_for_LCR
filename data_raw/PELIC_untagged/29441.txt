South Korea officially the Republic of Korea is located in East Asia neighbored by China to the west and Japan to the east. Actually Korea is a peninsula but due to the war outbroken in the 1950s by ideological differences between the people it was divided into two Koreas one of which is today's South Korea taking only the south portion of the peninsula. Korea is such a small country that it is hard to find on the map. However it is also a beautiful country where traditional and modern cultures coexist. Once visiting Seoul the capital city it is easily noticeable how the traditional features are combined into the one of the most urbanized cities in the world. Living in a mountainous terrain with four distinctive seasons people are inherently docile but passionate about sports and politics and education. Also they are of high reputation for a hard working nature which makes it possible for Korea to rank in twelfth in its GDP. These days it is getting popular in East Asia for Korean pop culture and plastic surgery.
