In Venezuela We have a law against air pollution because several years ago it was the most terrible problem that we had ever had. The Law says that Venezuelan people must throw away the trash every day at specific containers that each neighborhood has. Second if a person has a car she he might mantain the car in excellent condition. For example they have to change oil each 6 months and use purified gas. About factories the factories must build out of town to avoid pollution and also they must follow some rules to keep the enveroinment without contamination.
