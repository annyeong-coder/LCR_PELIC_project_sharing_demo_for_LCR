The picture about a dog kisses a fireman Good pictures always illustrate many fabulous stories and deep meanings. Look at the picture which the dog kisses the fireman. The fireman looks tired and the dog is consoling him. It seems they just finished the rescue. According to the picture I have three reactions which are the fireman's stress sensitivity of the dog and difficulty of the rescue. The first reaction of this picture is that the fireman suffers from a lot of stress. The picture tells me that he might have rescued many victims but he could not save all their lives. I think he feels himself has responsibility for the deaths. However we all knew it's impossible to rescue all of victims in some catastrophic events. In my opinion he should bestir himself before the next accident. The second reaction of this picture is that the dog is very sensitive. I think that it is not only sensitive about victims' locations but also sensitive about perceiving the fireman's sadness. Look at the picture. The dog is cheering him up by kissing. It seems that the dog encourages him in getting rid of negative emotions. I think it must be a good partner. The final reaction of this picture is that rescues are difficult and dangerous. Although the picture does not indicate what disaster they have or how serious the event is we can also image that situation must have been emergent. It leads to the fireman's exhaustion and the dog's reaction. I think rescues are full of difficulty because of uncertainties. Therefore we need responsible rescue workers and dogs to solve these tough situations. This is a good picture which implies me the fireman's stress sensitivity of the dog and difficulty of the rescue. It shows not only what it shows on surface of the picture but also what it has in deep aspects.
