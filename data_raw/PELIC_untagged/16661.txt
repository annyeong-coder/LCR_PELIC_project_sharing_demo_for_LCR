I am a homemaker and I like cooking. I am learning how to cook various foods. I have many cooking books. I especially enjoy cooking many kinds of pasta. I am also interested in cultures and foods of various countries. Now I am enjoying studying English in ELI. That is also very good chance for me to know many foods of other countries through making friends with people who are from different countries. However cooking sometimes bothers me because I cook almost every day. Besides I am busier than before because I am doing both English and house works lately. When I feel tired of cooking I and my husband go to restaurant. Actually that is what I really like to do.
