What shocked me was my friend's digital camera was stolen within a short time at a fancy and expensive restaurant when we traveled to Las Vegas. On the last day of traveling we decided to go to the restaurant which is famous for its roast beef. We were really excited when we made a reservation although the price was a little over our budget and also we didn't know if the taste was actually our liking. Before we went to there we wondered what we should wear to suit the restaurant's atmosphere. We wore dresses and it made us more exciting. That we ate at the restaurant was so delicious and we really enjoyed our meal. We took pictures every time as memory what we ate when the meal was carried. After going out there we stopped in front of the signboard to take a picture and then my friend noticed that she forgot to bring her camera. We returned to the restaurant to pick it up and it passed only three minutes or so. Even though we knew it was not good to leave something in the U. S we were sure to get it back at that time because that restaurant was high class. However when we asked a receptionist nobody knew about her camera. It was obvious that the camera had gone there. In addition to losing it the fact that it was the last day so there were a large number of pictures in that camera was so shocking and sad.
