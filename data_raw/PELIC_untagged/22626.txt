I like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon which was directed by Ang ANON_NAME_0. He directed many movies examples of which are Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon Brokeback Mountain and The Hulk some of which were successes. I like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon more than others. There are many reasons. First the movie is a Chinese movie winning four Oscars. Second I am from Taiwan where Ang ANON_NAME_0 was born. Taiwanese are all proud of him. Third the movie has many important actors including Chow ANON_NAME_1 fa playing Li Mu Bai Michelle Yeoh playing ANON_NAME_2 and ANON_NAME_3 Zi yi playing Jen. They are famous actors in Asia. I like Chow ANON_NAME_1 fa whose movies I watched a lot. The most important thing that I like is the story. Jen the daughter of a powerful family wanted to be a fighter. While she was travelling to Beijing she met her lover. However she left him because she wanted to have more power. Her martial arts teacher who was a bad woman used Jen to hurt Li Mu Bai. When Jen knew that she was just a tool was too late. She had hurt many people then she suicide. Don't always go my own way sometimes I should listen to other peoples' advice that I learned from the movie. Those are the reasons why I like this movie.
