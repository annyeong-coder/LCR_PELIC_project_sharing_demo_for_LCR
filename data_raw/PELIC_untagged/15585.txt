There are many problems have a big effect on our life such as illiteracy and poverty. The illiteracy problem needs a long time to solve. And it has many causes can be divided into the poverty which is the first enemy for humanity the parents' opinion and the health problems. The illiteracy problem is one of the poverty consequents. There are many people from different countries do not have enough money to bay the school costs. I think we can find these situations in the third world countries such as African and Latin American countries. Also some people from these countries do not have money to bay food therefore they do not think about the education. In addition some poor countries do not have money to offer schools in every places that means some people do not have chance to go to schools because there is no schools near them. I believe that if you found poverty problem in any place you will find illiteracy problem in that place. The parents' opinion has a strong effect on their children's education. So in some societies the education is not obligatory. That means many parents deprive their children to go to the schools and ask them to work to get money. Usually in this cases the parents did not go to the schools or got education and they do not believe that the education is necessary. I think to solve this problem should change this parent's opinion. The malady also a big cause for illiteracy problem. Because there are many people have difficult health problems deprive them to get education such as psychological and body problems like speaking or hearing problems. Therefore you can find illiteracy problems between the special needs people more than other. Usually this problem find in third world countries more than other countries. The illiteracy problem needs work hard from all of the world to overcome. And help those countries which have poverty and illiteracy. In addition this problem not easy to solve I think needs more than one generation to overcome.
