Speed limits differ from country to another. For some people speed limits is a big issue. Usually people who often drive in a long road trips really feel uncomfortable of the current speed limits. For example most of the states have speed limits around 65mph. For me I think that a little bit unfair . What I believe is speed limits should be around 80mph. Although a lot of people will disagree with me. Here I would like to explain my point of view. When I say 80mph I mean in big long highways which really safe if you drive a little bit faster in it. Usually in highways there are no people trying to cross the road no schools or children playing! So why they don't rise the speed limit. However I would totally agree not to raise the speed limits in the city or in a place that got people neighbors and schools . Even with the current speed limits inside the cities there is a lot of accidents in the city more than highways. Because highways usually flat and you can focus more on the road. In the end maybe they can at least make special roads for high speed limits or even no speed limits like Germany does.
