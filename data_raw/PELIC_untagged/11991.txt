Topic Over the next 10 years do you think the use of major languages other than English will increase or decrease on the World Wide Web Support your position orally or in writing by presenting reasons and examples. In my opinion English will keep playing its own role as the major language on the World Wide Web WWW even after more than 10 years. Even though there are various people who use different languages in the world it is difficult to provide them with their own language version in every web site. As far as all of us know English has become a universal language in the globalized world. Therefore majority of people who lead trends such as technology fashion and art use English to share their information or present their work with other people who are from different countries. Even though some of them want to show their work in other languages time is limited and the contents of the work are numerous. Because one of the essential merits of the World Wide Web is that people can have tons of information within a very short time people don't have enough time to learn a new language just in order to use WWW. Therefore at least on the WWW English will not decrease for the present.
