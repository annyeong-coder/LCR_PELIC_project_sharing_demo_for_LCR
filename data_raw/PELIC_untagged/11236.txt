I've always been a shy person. When I was a child my father who has a really sociable temper used to introduce me to other kids because I was so shy that I was inclined to play all day by myself if I didn't know anyone. Now my nature is changed a lot. I'm still a pretty shy person but I love meeting people. For a shy person it is difficult to introduce him herself but once passed this phase everything is easy. If I have to define myself I'd say that I am an extrovert person because I adore to talk with people especially with whom I get on well. This is the aspect of my character which I like most. I fondly remember the day when my boyfriend introduced me to his friends. It was the 2004 New Year's Day. I didn't even know Daniele whom is my boyfriend's closest friend and whose house we were supposed to go to celebrate the New Year's Day. Once there I really enjoy myself and I talked a lot with everyone even more than my boyfriend did. I was so much at my ease that it seemed to me that I had known them all my life.
