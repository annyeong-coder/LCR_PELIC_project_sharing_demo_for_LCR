I met my friend Angelica while I was living in U. S she was studying in University of Pittsburgh when she refused my gift. I decided to go away she got marriage in May 10 2007. One day I was shopping in Giant Eagle when I met her. I asked her did you have a child she smiled! . She told me she had divorced while she was studying in last semester.
