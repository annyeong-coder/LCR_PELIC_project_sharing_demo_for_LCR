I had a meal experience that I have remembered clearly. Five years ago a summer vacation my three good friends and I as well as our children traveled to an island named Hannan which is located in south China. We had an unforgettable seafood meal at local restaurant. Our table was settled outside of the restaurant along seashore. The cool and gentle wind blew away day hot the wave washed the seashore and sounded like nature music. At the comfortable environment we made jokes heard children's childish talking and enjoyed lots of fresh seafoods such as echinus sea cucumber crab lobster sea snail squilla and so on. Every seafood was showed to us in living before cooking. The delicious taste has impressed me deeply. Moreover the price of the meal was quite reasonable. The meal has been believed to be my best meal.
