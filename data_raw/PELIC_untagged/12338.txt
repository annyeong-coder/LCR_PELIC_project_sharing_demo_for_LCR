I can recall the moment when I think I was in a total flow in drawing ladies' dresses and accessories. It started when I was 5 year old but I stopped drawing it as soon as I became a middle school student. I had no time to draw so instead I scrapped my favorite styles from the leading Japan fashion magazines. However this habit also had to stop as soon as I entered a high school because of heavy studies and schedules. I still keep some of the pictures I drew and the whole file I scrapped but it still looks fascinating. To my strange I could never be able to draw dresses and accessories like I used to. I believe the creativity was possible because of the free environment I had in my childhood which made it out to be in the total flow.
