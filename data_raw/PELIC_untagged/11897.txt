Air quality is always one of the most important issues that many people concern. Unfortunately the air quality might be diverse in different places. When I was in China I lived in Guangzhou which is considered to have the worst air quality of China. I seldom saw the blue sky at that time. Everyday when I went out I could smell the gas released by cars and saw dust floating in the air. After I came to the United States I found that the air quality was better than China. Though Pittsburgh is regarded as having the second worst air quality of the United States I still cannot feel there is any pollution in the air. In order to ameliorate the poor air quality we should implement several different ways such as planting more trees using cleaning fuel and improving current air emission control regulations. I hope that in the future all people in the world can live in a clean and beautiful environment breathe the fresh air and enjoy the sunshine.
