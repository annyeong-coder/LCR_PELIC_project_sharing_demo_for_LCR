In the weekend I didn't do anything special. I wanted to rest so I slept very late. And I cleaned my apartment. I also watched many movies on television such as The deep end of the ocean Rock campus and Practical magic . On Sunday I went to Lotus to bought some vegetables. This is my weekend. I hope I can do more things next weekend.
