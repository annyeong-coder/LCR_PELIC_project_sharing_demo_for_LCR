By 1995 I had gotten married and by 1996 I had given birth to my first child. In the meantime I had been working in one of the most popular hospitals as a general surgeon. I had accomplished many successful surgeries and saved many lives. I had an awesome house and lived with my family in the same house in Istanbul. By 2005 I had my second child. I had still been working as a surgeon because had never thought about not being a surgeon. Now I am so happy for what I had done in my life so far.
