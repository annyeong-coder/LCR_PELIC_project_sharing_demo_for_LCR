I wish I had passed TOEFL test. If I had passed TOEFL test I would not have prepared for it therefore I do not need to worry about TOEFL and final exams at the same time. Also If only I had studied finance or economy. If I had studied finance or economy I would have my own businese. Furthermore If I had started my businese I could have traveled lots of countries. Anyway I enjoy my life and any mpnent I have.
