There is a German proverb Friendship is a plant which we must often water . It means that if we don't care about friend who I am close to now friendship will go far. When I was 7 years old I had a best friend who had lived next to my house which was very old. We used to hang out every day before my family had to move to other village which is far from former one. But when I met her again 6 years later our relationship couldn't get closer like before because I seldom had got touch with her. Instead I made a new best friend who lives close to my new house. In Korea there are also some proverbs about friendship. One of most famous proverbs is that A new clothe is always better than old one but old friend is always better than new one. However I think that if we didn't care about each other the friendship which is even older will be far away
