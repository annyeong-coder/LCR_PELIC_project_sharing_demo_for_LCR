He is wise who can make friend of a foe Scottish proverb. I think that is true even if I wouldn't waste my energy on trying to make an enemy my friend. Hadeel who I hated first became my best friend. In summer 2007 we met while we were registering to university. We argued about many things including my field whish is very important to me and her opinion bothered me. She acted like a person who knew everything. I saw her every day all the summer which was three months and we never talked. After that I saw her at university I thought that was the girl whose opinion was sting. I never thought we will be friends but when she came to me and started to explain what she meant that changed my feeling because she did not have to say anything. I consider myself lucky to have a friend who is wise beside me all the time.
