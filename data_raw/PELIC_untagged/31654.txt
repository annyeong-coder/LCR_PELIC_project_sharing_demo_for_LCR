In my life I have experienced three types of education. Being 6 years old I moved to Japan from China with my parents. Before leaving for Japan I was studying at Chinese elementary school. In those days after going back to home I studied until the side of my little finger getting black because of writing a lot. On the other hand in Japan I played with my friends after class everyday. Japan pays attention to student's creativities than China does. Now I am in the U. S. And I am going to a graduate school for master's degree. I want to do internship studying my major international marketing. After finishing master's degree I am going to try to find a job in the U. S. The best job for me is being able to visit both Japan and China using my three language skill. Although not being able to speak business English now I will try harder and harder to pursue my goal.
