Technology is like an effective medicine which can not only provide solutions but also make some side effects for us. In order to seek a much better life humans have been developing technology and achieving some results for a long time. The highly developed technology not only brings us the convenient and extended life but also influences our living environment. First our life has changed a lot and become more convenient since the high tech electric products invented. The world is smaller and smaller due to high speed transportations. For example we can receive the latest news by TV or internet communicate with others directly by cell phone and travel around the world rapidly by high speed plane or train. Therefore we have the comfortable and convenient life because the distance between us is much shorter than before. In addition human life has been longer and extended. What caused this result The developed technology make the medicine be progressive and the food plant massively. According to a survey from the U. S. Government the average life span of humans has grown to 78 years in the U. S. In 2011. The United Nations also expects that the population of the world would increase to seven billion by 2012. Nevertheless there are also some environmental problems which accompany highly with developed technology. The most serious is that global warming has made a huge impact and let some species become diminishing even extinct. For example polar bears or penguins are decreasing due to the ice cap are melting. It also caused the unusual climate that brought about some disasters as the flood in Bangkok has claimed inestimable lives recently. Developed technology may not only bring us positive effects but also negative influences. It all depends on our attitudes. Therefore government policies and strategies should be modified according to the high developed technology in order to provide a suitable environment for citizens and protect our own Earth.
