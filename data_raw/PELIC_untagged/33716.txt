There is no doubt that I have found my soul mate. Sara who is an assistant professor at King ANON_NAME_0 University and I have been best friends since I met her in our first year at college. Although we do not share the same interests and hobbies we are encouraging and supporting each other. For example I love oil painting but she is not interested in it. I remember once that she presented a gift to me which was a ticket to visit a gallery for one of the most famous painters in my county whom I admire a lot. Moreover she never say negative comments about my paintings which are horrible from my husband's perspective. Also she is a pianist. As I visit her she plays some pieces of music and I pretend that I am interested and fascinated with her music. Her ideas about music which I really want to understand are strange. She hates jazz music which I enjoy listening to and she consider it as a resource of headache. My daughter who is 9 years old is taking piano classes with her. She regards my daughter as a talent musician who has not been discovered yet. Even my parents who live in another city respect this friendship and whenever they call me they ask about my kids and her. However both of us are registered in the same reading discussion group that is related to reading novels which is our shared hobby.
