One of what my wife and I have done to economize is to take public transportation. After doing statistics we have found taking a bus instead of driving our car to work and school is really able to decrease our daily expense because we refill oil and do car maintainance fewer times than before. In addition nowadays the oil price is dramatically rising. Another significant reason we are concerned is the temperature of the world is getting higher. Therefore since taking public transportation has some advantages we have changed the way of daily transportation.
