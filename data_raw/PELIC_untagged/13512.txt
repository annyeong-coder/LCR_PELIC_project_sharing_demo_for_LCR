People in Taiwan and the U. S. Have many aspects of life in common such as democratic politics capitalism and religious freedom. However because of the histories geographic location and ethnic peoples in them there is some difference between their cultures. The main dissimilar factors are the eating habits educations religions and medical systems. Although some restaurants and drink enterprises such as the McDonald's and Coca Cola have their sites in both Taiwan and the U. S. People in Taiwan don't eat these kinds of food as everyday. Most of us like me take rice as our main food and tea as our main drink. Bread and sandwiches are side food. When we invite some friends or relatives to go to a restaurant it probably would be one offering traditional Taiwan food rice and many dishes. Also some people in Taiwan don't eat beef so that almost all restaurants offer more non beef meals. Because of the geographic location American food includes more Mexican food which is rarely found in Taiwan. Another important thing is that people in Taiwan don't like cold food such as bread and uncooked vegetables. We usually heat everything before we eat it. Thus when I come to the U. S. I don't feel very comfortable about the eating habits here.
