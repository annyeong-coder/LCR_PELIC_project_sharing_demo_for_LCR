Thesis It is not a good idea that students should have a say in the hiring and firing of teachers. One reason it's not a good idea is because students could be too emotional for having a say in the hiring and firing of teachers. Students often have favorite teachers and reluctant teachers. Their standard to judge teachers is very subjective. That is students could dislike some teachers just because they got either a bad grade or a scolding from those teachers. If such an emotional judgment reflects a decision on the hiring and firing of teachers it's certainly unfair. If so moreover teachers will not be able to evaluate students properly and might loose their authority over students.
