Betty is not quit sure she love David or not so she SHOULDN'T HAVE PROMISED David's marriage. She MIGHT HAVE TOLD David her feeling. She CAN CANCEL their wedding until she know who is her mr. Right. Even though cancel the wedding will heart David but marrige isn't a small decision. So she need have a determination.
