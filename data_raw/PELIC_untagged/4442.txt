If you are a Korean you must have heard about the murder incident in Hwasung. If you are not you can get a picture about what it was from this. It has been said to be the first consecutive murder incident in the history of Korea. It occurred more than 10 times including the last one in 1991. Almost all the women were raped and killed at the site. It has been believed that the murderer was the same person. The first murder was done in 1986. The victim was a young woman who was on the way home at night. At that time it was just seen as one of the usual murder cases. But before long another case was reported. As time went by it became a horror! About 1 800 000 policemen were thrown in that case. However it still remains unsolved. In 2004 the arraignment for that case was over. In the same year the movie titled Memory of Murder was released. People might have got any clue to the case through this movie because it was about what had happened in Hwasung.
