From my perspective water pollution is the most serious problem. Because water is the most essential substance for human being. Without water we cannot survive. Also once water got polluted it takes long time to be recovered. Furthermore nowadays there were series of accidents which caused water pollution. For example the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Even though we could prevent the accident causing water pollution it happend. We have to try to protect water by making powerful principal which can prevent a manmade disaster. Not only making principal but also following rules will be needed to protect water.
