If I hadn't come to the United states I would still have worked in Beijing. If I had worked in Beijing I would have gone back to China just after my landing the United States several weeks. If I hadn't quit my job I would have become a full professor. I I hadn't come to Pittsburgh I would have not studied at ELI. I wish I could avoid to be trapped the troubles of transffering.
