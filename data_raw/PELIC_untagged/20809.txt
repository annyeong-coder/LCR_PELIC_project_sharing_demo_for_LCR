In my opinion there are some advantages in this program YES for young entrepreneurs. First of all this program is to teach youths about business practice. The business ideas is as diverse as the participants themselves were. For example some young entrepreneurs came up with an interesting idea through this program for their futures. Another advantage is YES board members who helped the students. However the students on advertising and marketing techniques along with helping them come up with their own unique brands and slogans. Finally there are many advantages more than disadvantages in this program for young entrepreneurs.
