The most important relationship for me is my wife. I met her when I was studying in a medical school in Japan. She was studying in nurse's school also. We met at a Japanese martial art's club of the university. I am tall and she is also tall. So we often practiced the art of throwing and hitting in combination. She was earnest about not only club activity but studying nursing or medical problems. I got along well with her and we became close gradually. Three years after We met I proposed when I was last grade in medical school. We demonstrated Japanese martial arts in our wedding party. When we got married my wife was working in a hospital and I was studying for medical licence examination.
