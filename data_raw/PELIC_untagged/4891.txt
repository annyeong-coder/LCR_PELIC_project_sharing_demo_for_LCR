I think doing business is better than the others because there have some benefits in this case. At first people doing business by themselves can choose the best time to do that. Then nobody say about that is good or bad that just your own opinion. Finally I think doing business is better than the others about earn money but doing business also have trouble. I think doing business is more harder than work in the company because work in the company you don't need to think about the trouble thing but doing business have a lot of thing that you need to think about and make a decision that is the best way to doing in business. I still choose business because sometimes it is a hard career but also it makes much money.
