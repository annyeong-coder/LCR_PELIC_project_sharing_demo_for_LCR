Posted February 16 at15 30 03 Hi everybody. I'm writing this note to introduce my self to you my classmates in English 047. Our teacher wants a profile from each of us. At first I was confused by this assignment because my English dictionary defines profile as a side of someone's head. I thought Why does she want that She sees my head every day! Then I saw the next definition a short description of a person's life and character. OK then. Here is my profile My name is Student's Name . Some of my friends are calling me Pay Ha because that is how my initial sounding in German.
