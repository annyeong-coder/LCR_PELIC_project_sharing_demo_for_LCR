I have studied Visual Design since 2002. I graduated a University in 2007. Since then I entered a fashion company and worked for 3years. I quitted my company since 2011. Since then I decided a study abroad to get Master's degree in USA. I'm going to study for 3years and get a job. These days I have learned English and TOEFL in Pittsburgh for 3months ago.
