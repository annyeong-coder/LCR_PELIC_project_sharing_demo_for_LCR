In class room the teacher tries to control or watching students What do you do and the teacher gives exercises or homework the use step that teacher teaches them for solve problems and the teacher evaluates the students by tests and gives grades to them. If they get A . The teacher will give reword to them but it makes pressure to the students because they want to get A and make they want to win another students in class and then when the students try to solve problems. They like to use step for solve problem that the teacher teach them so they don't have new ideas that they think by themselves. All of which destroy their creativity however I think it is good if the teacher teaches the students just only basis skill and try to help them get their ideas and then when they have their ideas the teacher should try to understand their ideas and don't say yes or on about their ideas and the teacher try to make the students to have one more solutions when they want to solve problems. It can help students have their creativity.
