For me friends are people who know you really well and share secrets with you. My best friend Jack who not only knows me really well and shares secrets with me also has the same personality and interests as me. We were classmates when we studied in high school. At first we were very shy but the funniest thing is that we were only shy at first. After we stared to talk to each other we found out we are not the people who are really shy only at first. Also we both very like to make jokes with our friends. In addition we both are very lazy. We always made our teacher who is our tutor taught us math because we always skipped his class and went back home and took a rest. Also we have a lot of the same interests. First we both love Rock music. We always share our CDs which we really like. In addition we made a band which was pretty popular in our school. Moreover we always practice instrument together that was the happiest time we had. Also we really liked to go shopping. Sometimes we would buy some magazines and studied about fashion a little bit. We not only went shopping together we also used to work in the same fashion clothes shop which is very famous in our city. We both are really proud of that we used to work in the shop. Finally Jack is my best friend who I really proud of the fact that I can meet him. I think our friendship can last to forever.
