The best mirror is an old friend . I agree with George Herbert who is English poet and novelist . People usually like to make friends who are samilar with you . Some person will disagree with my opinion . I have been have a good friend when I was in China . She gave me a lot of help that on my life everywhere . She was who comfort me every time when I felt said and depressed . We both like to play basketball that everyday play together . She was who walked with me at snowing night she was who let me feel happy at my brithday part ! I missing her very much .
