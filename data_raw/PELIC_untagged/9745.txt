Hi I am Horace Last Name . Welcome to my website. I have been working on this for a week. This website should be done in one day or two. I have always been a work hard disciplined guy. I grew up in Taichung Taiwan. I grew up in an environment full of rules and disciplines and that made me become a work hard disciplined guy. But after I graduated from junior high school I have been trying to change my personalities and made myself more open minded. I think I did change a lot of myself but I have not reached my ideal yet. By the way I have been collecting different types of coins from different countries. Though most of the coins were given by my father. But right now I have been in America and I have already been collecting the coins. I have collected more than 20 kinds of quarters if you're interested just click the photos below and check it by yourself.
