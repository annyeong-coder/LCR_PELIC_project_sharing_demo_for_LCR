There are in Pittsburgh a lot of places to eat differents kinds of food that you enjoy. I love italian food this is my favorite kind. Although every places here given suggestion for a lot of food in the same kind of restaurant. My favorite here call Casbah is like a meditterranian food very special and different. But not only food is the place so amazing too. Because is very particular and beautiful. This restaurant location is in Shadyside in Highland avenue. I'm sure that my favorite place to eat here.
