This spring break I am going to go to New York with my uncle. In the first I decided to go to Texas but the ticket was very expensive. I am going to wait for my uncle. He is going to come to Pittsburgh on Friday after that we are going to travel to New York together by car. We are going to visit some place like the Statue of Liberty Times Square Wall Street and the Empire State Building. I hope this trip will be a lot of fun.
