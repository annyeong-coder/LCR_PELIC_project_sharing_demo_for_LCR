I partially agree and partially disagree with this. According to the author when children first come to school they are excited and are eager to learn. But this passion passes by the time they finish fourth or fifth grade due to losing sense of pleasure in their own creativity. Not always this is true because I think that in elementary school a lot depends on teacher. It depends on how teacher presents the subject. This may have impact on student through the end of his student's life.
