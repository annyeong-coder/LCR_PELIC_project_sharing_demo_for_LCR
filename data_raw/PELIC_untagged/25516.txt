Several years ago m good friends and I as well as our children traveled to an island named Hainan located in the South of China. I had my best meal in a local restaurant near to seashore. It was in the evening. Our table was set at outside of the restaurant. A fitfull wind from sea blew away the hot air of daytime. Our table was full of many kinds of seafood and tropical fruits such as conch sea cucumber lobster jellyfish shrimp and so on. Many of them I have not named in English. Every kind of seafood would show to us when they were alive before cooked. I had never eaten varied seafood at the same time. I was deeply impressed. Moreover I had the dinner with my good and congenial friends and our lovely kids.
