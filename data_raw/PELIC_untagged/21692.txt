In Aid Al fitir all the muslims around the world celebrate at the same day. This day is important for us because we breake the fast after Ramadan by eating the breakfast and celebrate all the day and night. Aid Al fitir in my country is the most important holyday all over the year because we prepare a breakfast for the family gathering make the children happy and celebrate the rest of the day by watching the fireworks and join the celebration.
