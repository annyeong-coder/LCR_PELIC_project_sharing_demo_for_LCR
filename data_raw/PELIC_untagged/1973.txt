When I was young I was curious about smoking. That may because my father used to smoke at that time. So I had tried to smoke until this happened. One day when I was 8 years old my family went to my grandmother's house. After we finished lunch my sister my cousin and I went to the second floor to play. While playing we saw a movie which explained how to smoke so I wanted to try it. After few minutes I prepared to smoke and told them to try it together. On the roof I lit on the cigarette and inhaled deeply on it. But I didn't know what to do after that so I just swallowed the smoke. As soon as I swallowed it I got nauseous. Finally I threw up and I got confused because I didn't think smoking would be that bad. After that experience I learned that smoking was really bad.
