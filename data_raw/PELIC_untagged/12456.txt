These days the divorced couples are increasing. Surely there are many reasons of divorce but I think the effects of divorce are more important than reasons. Especially divorce causes some problems for family life. First of all after divorce all family members are damaged. I think it is the most major effect of divorce. Divorced couple would be depressed and sad. They may loose their family spouse and even children. That makes them so stressful and stress causes their mental disease. Children as well as divorced couple are damaged. Children are vulnerable so it is easy to be shocked. That affects their school life or social life. Secondly economic problems take place after divorce. In women's case they would have some problems with money. Especially if the woman is housewife they have to be worried about their life. In Korea it is so common that women should be looking for a job after divorce. But to get a job and to earn money is not easy. Sometimes they cannot stand by themselves so they decide to marry other men as an alternative. Thirdly divorce lowers society's perception of a family. Many people do not think divorced people are good. People are certain that their characteristics have some problems. In company divorced women are interfered with their promotion. Unless they have proficient ability to do something for company not only the company is not interested in their promotion but also it tries to lay off divorced women. To sum up damaged family economic problems and society's perception of family are effects of divorce.
