I moved to a new house in last weekend and my living room is new! When you enter through the main door you can see the new table that I use to put the Mac and books. On right you can see a sofa and a confortable chair. And between them there is a beautiful fire place! I need to buy a rug. When I buy I will put in front of the fire place. The living room has two windows. First window is behind the chair. Second window is beside the table. I putted the chair and the table close the window because I can use the light window. Things new is so good. The new living room is better.
