I think competition hinders creativity because competition makes kids feel heavy pressure which tries so hard to boost their own chances of success in a limited period of time. It involves heavy evaluation pressure frustration and surveillance. When I was a kid I joined lots of music competitions. I was watched by my tutors and parents while I practiced. They over controlled the activities in my childhood and set high standards for me to achieve. Besides I had to give performances in front of my relatives for practicing on stage. At that time I felt really anxious when I played music in public. Then I knew my passion about music turned into aversion.
