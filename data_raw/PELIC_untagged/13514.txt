The education it's the most important thing that should worry about for anyone who needs to achieve to his her goal. So the government should play the biggest role to support it. We can compare between the different and the similar aspects between the education in different culture such as my country Libya and USA because I think they have some different culture. So I'm going to write about the aspects in the education specific in university stages. Costs rules and time schedule are more effective thing that is I think should to write about. First of all the education in Libya it have had most worrying than other things like safety or healthy care you can study in Libya and you haven't to pay any money during your study you have benefit for that because you have to focus just in your study maybe you must pay a little charge for example when you want to get some official documents that belongs to you like graduate certificate and transcript but in general you don't need to pay. Also you can have many activities or events with your classmates which your university will do for free. But here in the USA that is what I noticed you have to pay everything you have to pay for your registration books and activities also. In addition I noticed that a lot of students here they are working during their study to get money to afford these expensive study costs. The second item is the rule that is the student should be applies during his her study in the university every university has a specific system and rules but in general they have the same. However in Libya the rule is stricter than USA. In Libya for example during the class you can't leave the class without permission from your teacher. There is no food drink and cell phone during the class. You have to wear clothes that is must me more convenient and more respectful
