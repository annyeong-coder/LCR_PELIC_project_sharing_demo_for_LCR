Since it is kind of paragraph that you can write about it but I'll try my best to write about my own personality. First of all I'm kind of a person who is independent. I like to take care about myself and I usually don't ask people to give me help. However I'm a person who would like to help people unreluctantly. For example several months ago ANON_NAME_0 who is friend of mine lives in Saudi Arabia called me to buy him a car from here and without any reluctance I just said count on me and don't worry so right now he owns a car from USA that was bought by me. Also I'm a person whose friends like him so much. How's come Today my birth day and they going to do party for me even though I told them isn't a big deal but they insisted strongly to do it for me. I'm really appreciate that. Also I'm a person who likes sport I usually play sport that is categorized a group sport such as soccer and volleyball. Volley ball is the sport which consists from 6 players I like it the most.
