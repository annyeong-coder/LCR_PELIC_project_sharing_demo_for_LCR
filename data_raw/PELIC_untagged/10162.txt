Several hundreds years ago diverse animals such as lions panda bears and golden snub nosed monkeys lived in an undeveloped beautiful nature. At that time people seldom captured these animals. For example 100 years ago a lion might have lived in the grassland of Africa as a king because few hunters would go there. However as the improvement of human technology more and more people have realized the worth of these animals and begun to hunt them for benefit. A lot of animals are killed. Their fur became noblewomen's coats and their heads became decorations on hunters' wall. On the other hand people's activities also make animals disappear from this world. For example Yangtze River dolphins which is called the dead species which is alive by environmentalists has been disappearing because the pollution of their home Yangtze River. In 2002 the only man breeding Yangtze River dolphin died. Then environmentalists began to search Yangtze River dolphin along drainage area of Yangtze River. Unfortunately they did not find anything. Now some environmentalists announce that Yangtze River dolphin is extinct. Are Yangtze River dolphins really extinct We are not sure yet. But there is one thing that we are quietly sure if we don't protect animals most of them will become endangered animals gradually and then disappeared from this world forever. In order to save them we humans should do a lot of things. First we should try our best to protect their wild species and keep them far away from hunters. Second we should protect their habitats and found preserves for them. Finally we should reduce and eliminate the bad effect from people's activities such as enlarging of cities deforestation and pollution in rivers etc.
