My father was a big help to me when I was a teenager. He always helped me learn new things and encourage me to learn more and more. I remember in summer's vacations he took us to tour on many countries and that let me learn a lot about other cultures. Also he encored me to complete my studding in higher degree therefore he made me to pursue a master's degree. Finally I would say that I had influenced from my father and I think this made me see him a great man.
