I grew up in Taiwan. I have been living in Taipei for 24 years. When I was 6 year old my mother had me learn to play the piano. Then I joined a band and participated in a lot of national competitions. Moreover I have traveled many countries. By Traveling I can learn many different cultures and eat different styles of food. Therefore I like traveling.
