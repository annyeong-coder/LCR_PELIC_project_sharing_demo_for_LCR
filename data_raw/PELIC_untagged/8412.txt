The most important thing to economize is buying only what we really need. All I always keep in my mind is I should not buy what will not be necessary in two weeks. As for food I don't care whether it's expensive or not because food is really important in my life. I want to eat delicious and healthy food even though it's expensive. I also spend money on vacations. Because I can't have enough holidays in Japan it is necessary for me to enjoy my limited holidays. I don't want to ruin my vacations because of saving money. On the other hand I rarely use an air conditioning during summer even though I feel a little hot. Instead of turning on the air conditioning I open windows or change clothes to feel cooler. When I go to the supermarket I usually buy food enough only for one day. I go there everyday and choose food I want to use for dinner. Even though they sell something at a special low price I never buy it if it is not necessary for the dinner. I think there should be some reasons when people sell something at a very low price. I suppose we can economize unless we waste money on something unnecessary.
