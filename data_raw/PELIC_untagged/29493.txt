Since Taiwan is a small island it is difficult to find a place to bury the trash from our daily life. Around twenty years ago our government has started to encourage residents to do recycling therefore we can sell paper plastics bottles and metal cans etc. To gain extra money. Due to the extra income form recycling many poor people would like to collect recyclable stuff along streets. However the additional money can not attract people who already have enough money to enjoy their life to do recycling. Since eight years ago stores and markets have been requested to stop providing plastic bags that we used to reuse to pack our garbage for their customers. After that more and more cities in Taiwan were beginning to require the citizens to buy specific garbage bags to put their rubbish. Because the bags are not very cheap people would recycle all kinds of available resources as much as possible and reduce their scraps to save money.
