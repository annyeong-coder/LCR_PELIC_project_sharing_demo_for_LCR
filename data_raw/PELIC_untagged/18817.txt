During my study at ELI I made many achievements. The first and most important one was improving my writing. Before coming to ELI I used to write randomly without any kind of organization. After the course of writing we had by Sally I learned how to write academically organize ideas logically and increase writing speed because of free writing tasks we had every week. The second thing I benefited at ELI is getting acquainted with many different cultures such as Chinese Japanese and Saudi Arabian. Though there are many things in common between the Saudi culture and my Libyan culture I understood lots of new aspects of the Saudi culture and many Saudi students clarified many ambiguities I had about Saudi cultures from different perspectives such as food social life entertainment and customs. I also learned too much from ELI teachers' behaviors and attitudes their friendliness and tolerance. For me it was a great experience that stuck in my memory!
