One of my hobbies is looking for good restaurants. I have been looking for good restaurants in Japan. And I also look for good place to eat in Pittsburgh. There are two restaurants that are my favorite a French restaurant in Japan and an Italian restaurant in Pittsburgh. Although there are several differences between them both of them are fantastic restaurants. First the two restaurants serve different kinds of foods. One is French restaurant and the other is Italian so the ingredients that they use are so different. However the freshness of ingredients and the high quality of taste are the same. For example the taste of salad and other side dishes like soup is also very important aspect to look for good restaurant. Both two restaurant have salad and side dishes in good quality. Second the countries they are in is the second difference between the two restaurants. The French restaurant is in Japan and the Italian restaurant is in America. People who come to the restaurants are different. The culture of them is different but the atmosphere of both restaurants is very comfortable. Although both of them not so big place have nice pictures on the wall and people who works in there have good smile. Therefore I feel very relaxed when I go to them. In addition the two restaurants are located in different places. The French restaurant in Japan is in the countryside. On the other hand the Italian restaurant in Pittsburgh is located in suburbs. Nevertheless restaurants have very long lines. When I went to the Italian restaurant in Pittsburgh last week I waited almost 1 hour to have dinner. And the French restaurant in Japan is also full of people every time I go. Despite of these differences between these two restaurants both of them are very nice so they are my favorite restaurants. I am very glad to have found these restaurants.
