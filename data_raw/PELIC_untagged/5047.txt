1. The recourses from parents. 2. Attend to a university. 3. Have a nice job in the future. There have many kinds of pressures of being a student not only for students who study in hometown but also for students who study aboard. They have pressures from parents attending to undergraduate or graduate school and having a nice job in the future. The pressure from parents is the most common pressure with students who study aboard. Most of the students don't have a job while they're studying so their parents need to afford them money to live buy food and buy things for life and school. Those things cost a lot. Therefore parents would like their children to finish their education as fast as they can. Attending to undergraduate or graduate school also has a lot of pressure. Most of the students would like to study in a better school which means they need to spend lots of time for studying taking quizzes and tests so that they can attend the school they want. Having a nice job in the future has lots of pressure too. Before you have a nice work you need to finish the study and get a good degree. Otherwise you won't be accepted by a good company. It's also important for people who want to get married and have a family. If you don't have a job then you can't have the ability to support your family. It's true that students have many pressures. They need to take care of their grades and make sure they can have a high score of the exam. They also need to clear their mind to decide what they are going to be in the future.
