The word FRIEND has many meanings. Some people define it in an emotional way and others define it in logical way. People who think emotionally say that a friend is a person whom you know well and like a lot but who is usually not a member of your family. Other people who think reasonably say that a friend is a person who support you and help you when you need something so the help that a friend give is without money. For me I define a friend in both ways emotionally and logically.
