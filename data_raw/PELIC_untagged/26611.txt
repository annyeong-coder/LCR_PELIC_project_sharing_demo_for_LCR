I would like to introduce a classmate to you. Her name is Saia. She says that her name means tranquility or peace. She does not use a title or nickname. However her friends used to call her Sajjo which means something like honey or dear. She feels good about her name. In fact she says that she loves her name. She is from Saudi Arabia but now she is living in Pittsburgh. She lives in downtown. She enjoys walking listening music and taking photos as a hobby. I asked her about how did she know about ELI and she said that she knew about it by her friends. The reason that she is studying English is because she is planning to complete her master degree.
