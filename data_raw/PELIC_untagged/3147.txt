As a human society we share one planet with its air water and land. Anything that happens in any part of the planet earth affects all of its inhabitants throughout the glob. Therefore when it comes to the nuclear weapons issue the threat to the existence of the human race and planet earth is universal. The only rational solution to such an existential threat is getting rid of all nuclear weapons on our planet. The use of these and other mass killing weapons can only be described as criminal. Therefore the world should move away from all weapons of mass distractions for the sake of our only planet and future generation. This energy should help people to improve their life by providing them power and other important source. Of course if we use this incredible energy in peaceful way it might be the solution for a lot of our problems. But using it during the war or to kill innocent people even destroys countries or win a conflict is unacceptable. Of course this is the responsibility of our leaders to find a way that help in using this energy in a positive way.
