I have lived in Pittsburgh since August 2010. When I came to Pittsburgh I searched for apartment and I found my apartment after three months so I have lived in Brookline since then. Also I have had car since I moved in my apartment so I visited some interesting places such as Water Front and Robinson but I haven t traveled to other cities. Also I have eaten in japanese resturant. Since September I have been studing English as a second langauge in the ELI so I have had certificate for Fall term from them. Also I have celebrated with pittsburghers New Year. Also I have been searching for conditional admission for master degree and I have been preparing for ILTS test.
