The following story actually happened to a Japanese professional photographer who lives in Canada and works for NHK from time to time. I had met him a few years ago at a Japanese restaurant. On one morning last week when he went to the bus stop in front of his house to go to his office. He had an eye contact with a suspicious looking man at the bus stop. He took a bus but the man remained at the bus stop. Later in the day he got a phone call from the police and discovered What had happened. The suspicious looking man was a thief and broke into the photographer's house. He stole many items including expensive cameras a big tele photo lens and a computer etc. He put them in two bags and tried to hitch a ride on Highway 1 which is only a few blocks away. As in Japan it is not allowed to hitch hike on super highways. He did not know What a role in the highway. Soon a police cruiser stopped to tell him to move out of the highway but the kind police officer offered him a ride. When the man sat in the car the officer could see a Japanese book sticking out of one of the bags and became suspicious. The officer asked to examine the contents of the bags and found more stolen goods there. The thief initially said he was carrying them to a Japanese friend but finally admitted his crime and was arrested on the spot. From the business card placed inside the computer the police officer could find the phone number of the photographer and called him to tell the story.
