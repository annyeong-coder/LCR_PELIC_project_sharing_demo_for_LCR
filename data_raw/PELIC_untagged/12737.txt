My husband and I like to play different types of sports. I prefer swimming rather than Golf but my husband would rather play golf than go swimming. In my idea swimming emphasizes faster movements and more dexterous skills and golf stresses concentration and politeness. However the both of golf and swimming develop how to control emotion. The last advantage from playing two sports make more pleasant for me because I have more friends and more happiness.
