Last month ANON_NAME_0 was playing soccer with my friends and his hand was broken. Then he could not move his hand and we could not treat well. Of course ANON_NAME_0 should not have to play hard because the injury that he had might be strong or dangerous. Anyway we went to a hospital and the doctor said to him you should not had to move your hand more and try to stay at home these days. In addition ANON_NAME_0 needs time to heal his hand.
