1. I learn English quickly because I study in the ELI. 2. I couldn't understand what the clerks said when I came to Pittsburgh. 3. Although my English is poor I need to use it in my normal life. 4. Before I came to Pittsburgh I went to New York City. 5. I didn't go to sleep until I finished my homework last night.
