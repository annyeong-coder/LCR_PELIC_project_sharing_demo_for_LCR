My favorite place in New York is the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In the museum collected many famous masterpieces and works of art from all over the world. As you enter the museum through the main entrance the Egyptian Art gallery is on the first floor on your right. European Sculpture and Decorative Arts are in directly in front of you and the Greek and Roman Art is on your left. Next to that there are Arts of Africa Oceania and Americas galleries. The Modern Art is in the left corner. In back of museum and in the middle there is the ANON_NAME_0 Lehman Collection exhibition. On both sides there are rest rooms and elevator access. European Paintings occupy the center part of the second floor. In front of European Paintings you can find Drawings Prints and Photographs collections and the Chinese Art. On the right side of the Chinese Art and under American Wing there is the Japanese Art. Finally the galleries of Modern Art and European Sculptures of 18th and early 20th Century there are on the left side. The ground floor occupies the Ruth and Harold D. Uris Center for Education on the left and the Cafeteria on the right. If you visited of the Metropolitan Museum of Art once you will never forget this place.
