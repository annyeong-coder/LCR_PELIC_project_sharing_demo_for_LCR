I had read the 4 stories in the chapter 1. I think the Cathy Maready and Aron Ralston did something is bad because they never to told somebody their plan who is very dangerous. So the problem had come nobody can help they. The NSR is good services they did do very well because they cave many people life. So I think this is good. And other good one is Ernest Shackleton. In 1914 he led expedition to the Antarcitc. In the way they have problem he can help his team to pass the problem. So I think he is good. The people to do thing that was very dangerous and he never to told other people his plan. This is bad. Because if you have problem no people can help you. The people have problem and he can strong to get over the problem this is good.
