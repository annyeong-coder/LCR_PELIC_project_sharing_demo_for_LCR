Sausage kite and knitting evoke memories of my childhood when I see or hear them. When I was elementary school our family was poor. Until I was 4th grade in school I had never seen sausage. One day when I visited my friend who was rich I tried to eat sausage first time. I still can't forget the taste. Second I used to fly a kite every thanksgiving day. Finally my mother was used to knitting all of day. Even now whenever I see or hear about them those evokes my memories of childhood.
