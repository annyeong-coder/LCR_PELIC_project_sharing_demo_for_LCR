After the semester I have lots of exciting plans which are trips. In August I won't be Pittsburgh almost entire a month. First I will join the ELI group activities to go to Kenny Wood and Niagara Falls. Some students will go back their countries so this will be the last time to hang out them. After that I will go to the Toronto in which my friend lives. I have known him since 2000. I met him in my country but two years ago he was fired by his company. I haven't met him since then. Therefore I will go to there to see him. Next I will go to New York where I love. According to Madonna's song I love NY she sings no other city ever made me glad except New York . I agree with this lyric. New York City is the most exciting place in the world. I must enjoy there. After NYC I will go to Los Angels in which I visit first time. I haven't made a plan what to do at there but I love the sea so I want to go to the sea and hopefully I try to surf. It's obvious after the semester I will be busy. I will visit Toronto NYC and LA. I haven't taken a vacation since I came the US. Therefore this is the time to chill out.
