Types of students Students have many duties to do. The most important duty is study. But there are many types of students for example students who are diligent and always concentrate on the lesson students who do not care about their lesson but just want to improve their skill and students who do not interested in anything. Who are diligent and always concentrate on the lesson the best student somebody do everything follow by their teachers even if they are wrong. Teacher love this type who do not care about their lesson but just want to improve their skill they usually got troubles with their teacher they seem like not to concentrate on the lesson they have a lot of ego teachers have to try to understand this type of student who do not interested in anything they usually play with their friends. In my stereotype this type of student often be a rich man it may happens because of their family have no time to take care their children
