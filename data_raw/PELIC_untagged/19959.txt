I think is appropriate that parents pass on cooking skills to their children because if you are not capable to cook basics things you sure will eat fast food. Learning the cooking skills is a process that begin when you see your mother or someone in your family cooking so then these will be normal for you. I think is not a requirement for cook but it is necessary if you must cook everyday. I think it is a significant acquirement. Perhaps these cooking skills changes your life!
