My Friend's Room When I was kid I used to go to my friend's house to play games. My friend's room was like my dream room. It had a lot of games and sketchbook stories and video game. First on the left there was an orange door behind the door there was a big TV we were playing video games on it. Then on the right of the TV there was a big table for books stories and sketchbook we used to read some books together when he bought a new one. In front of the table his bed we used to sit on his bed when we played video games. After that in the front of the room there was a magic corner a lot of games in this corner and we used to waste 3 to 5 hours in this lovely corner. In conclusion. I was feel crazy when my mother tell that we would go to visit this friend.
