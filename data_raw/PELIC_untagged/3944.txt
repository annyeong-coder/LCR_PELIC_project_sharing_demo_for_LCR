In Korea our wedding is very similar to the U. S wedding. Bride usually wears white dress and veil whereas broom wears tuxedo. We have a special wedding house so most people have their wedding there. Because of wedding house's popularity someone who wants to make wedding there needs to reserve that place first. In the wedding process broom goes to the center of wedding house and waits for the bride. And then bride goes to the place which broom is waiting for with her father. At this time everyone claps their hands and classical music will be played. After all wedding the couple and all the other people eat some food together.
