Homework. A few days ago I took a trip to Washington D. C. So I had to be absent two days from ELI class. However I wished I would not be behind my study when I come back so I brought my textbooks with me. At first day of my trip my husband and I arrived there almost 10 pm he and I was so tired due to long time drive. Even though my inner voice told me I had to do my homework I ignored it. Next day also I couldn't see my textbook even one page. Instead of studying I watched Korean drama. If I had studied at that time I would not have been lost in my class . Also if I had finished my homework on time I couldn't have slept last night because of doing homework. If I had kept mind this saying Never put off till tomorrow what can be done today I would not have made all mistake.
