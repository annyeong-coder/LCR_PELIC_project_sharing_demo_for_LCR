This article states that scientists are using new techniques to manipulate the genetic material in all of humans feeding resources to improve our lives by changing the food we eat the animals we raise and perhaps our own bodies. But critics fight against scientists because they believe that scientists may cause new dangers for future generations. This is not new but the new is the way that scientists started to use in order to improve us. They can directly manipulate particular strands of DNA deoxyribonucleic acid a basic genetic unit of all life to get faster and certain outcomes. Even though there are debate over whether genetically modified food may cause harm to humans or not some experts argue that kind of food had already introduced and that helped poorest countries. However skeptics believe that scientists are needed to do more research to ensure that genetically modified foods safe for humans and animals to eat. There are more than one kind of genetic engineering. One called Cloning which is another way to normal sexual reproduction. In cloning an animal or plant is produced from the genes of only individual rather than from the genes of two or parents. And the pappy's genes are exact copy of its parent. One of the courses that Genetic engineering of humans has taken is gene therapy a type of medical treatment where healthy genetic material is introduced into people who suffer from inheritable conditions. Critics oppose changing human beings and warn that we may create a genetic aristocracy which result in producing a new human species who will be much smarter than Natural humans and as a consequent these new human will control the sciences and businesses and will exclude the Natural humans from the major positions.
