This semester I have achieved enhancing my reading skill by learning many vocabularies. Many vocabularies of level five including core vocabularies were quite new vocabularies that I had never heard. Furthermore I could learn how to use the words correctly this semester. In retrospect even if I knew the meaning of the word I did not know how to use them correctly and their collocations. Of course I struggled to remember many new vocabularies. However many assignments of the ELI programs helped me with increasing my vocabularies spontaneously. Especially activities of core vocabularies integrated into every class were very helpful to foster my vocabularies. In the middle of this semester I found that I could read English sentences more smoothly than before because I could see many words that I learned in English articles. Now I am not reluctant to read something in English as before. Reinforcing my English skills is crucial for me to adapt to the life in the US so I have had an inclination to study English hard. Before all I think I have enjoyed studying English this semester and improvement of my reading skill have attributed to that.
