My name is ANON_NAME_0. I am from Saudi Arabia. I am 25 years old. I am studying English in ELI because I want to get a master degree from University of Pittsburgh. About my hobbies I am interested in watching American movies. Usually when I have time I go with my friends to a theater to watch a movie. When the weather is bad I invite them to come to my apartment and watch a movie together. I think watching movies is a good way to learn English. I hope we will have an interesting time together while we are studying in the ELI.
