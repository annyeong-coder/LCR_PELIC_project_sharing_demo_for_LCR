I have been traveled several places. Especially I remember three trips. First of all when I was in high school I have been to Austrailia for a week. I went to the Gold Coast in Australia's west. There is fantastic scene and hotel. Behind the hotel is beautiful woods and river and in front of it is wide coast. I have stayed top of floor. When I got up in the morning I saw the coast. I never forget that sun and sea. That scene still remains my brain. I thought when I will be older I will live there. Second I traveled to Chicago. There was very impressed. I went to Johnhancock bar. Their night scene was fantastic. In their can see most of downtown and the Michigan lake. And there are many shopping mall like the Macy. I bought my friend's Christmas gift in there. Finally I traveled in Germany. There was impressed too. Roads and buildings was very cleaned so wherever I went anywhere I felt very convenient. People have hospitality too. When I forgot the way people would guide me kindly. And there is beer country. People drink a beer from afternoon. When I see their expression for drinking one I knew that they feel happy. I liked their beer culture really.
