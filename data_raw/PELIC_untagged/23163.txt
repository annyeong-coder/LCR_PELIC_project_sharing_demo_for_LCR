Harry Potter used to be a famous novel in Taiwan in the same way its movie adaptation was also popular. During those days people loved to discuss the novel and the movie about Harry Potter but don't enjoy discuss the movie anymore because the movie adaptation of Harry Potter is a little different from the novel's version. There are two main differences between books and movies. First of all the content in book has more information than that in movie adaptation. It's obvious that you can have more information and imagination when you read the books. The movie adaptation might match the majority of book but some main and important details miss somehow and the missing details are crucial clues for people to engage in the story. In the other words if you watch the movie without reading the book you might not understand some special words or situations in the movie. Another difference between movie and book is that the leading actors in the movie are all adult now but those in book are still children. Produce a movie take a lot of time and energy and the actors in real life keep growing up everyday. When the Harry Potter's latest episode is published the leading actors in book are still children but the leading actors in the movies are not the little children anymore. Information and the age of actors are the main differences between book and movie and that is why people don't like to watch the latest movie. If the movie director wants Harry Potter's fans to enjoy watching movie he should pay attention to those problems.
