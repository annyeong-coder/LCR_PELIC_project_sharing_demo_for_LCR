When we were children everything was looked bigger and more precious. Being in six I had good experience about money and it keeps me thinking about the relative value of money. My five dollars was stolen by a boy. Here is the story. When I was in six I was on my way to the market with five dollars that were given by my mother. First I had the money in my fist not to lose it. Then I put the money in my pocket because I thought that it was safer. At that moment a boy approached me and whispered in my ear. Hey can you see that man He is a very bad person and he will get all of your money! He told me that he could hide my money and then he put his hand in my side pocket and grabbed something there and put his hand in my pocket on back of my pants. I thought that he moved my money from my side pocket to the back pocket. After that he ran away and joined with the bad man and they ran together. I stood there silently for minutes because it had happened too quickly for a little boy and it had been related to the bad man which had been a fearful subject for me. After a few minutes I checked my back pocket but money was not there. I came back home crying and I cannot forget that moment. This experience always reminds me 'the relative value of money'. To me in the present five dollars is just some money that can be used for lunch or coffee. However to the young boy in the past five dollars was such a huge amount of money. Surely the worth of money is being changed but that is not all. I was just a little kid and the economical situation of my family was not good at that time. For these reasons the value of five dollars to the kid was same as that of a hundred dollars to me now. Whenever I remember the memory I always talk to my mother how worth the money was to me. There is nothing better than memories. In my case I have precious memory about money and it makes me remember the little kid in the past and feel growing.
