My name is ANON_NAME_0 Last Name ANON_NAME_0 sounds like lily or ANON_NAME_1 ANON_NAME_1 so maybe some people who is first to meet me thinks that this is my English name. No this is my true first name. I love this name bucause it's really easy to be remebered. Also I like some sports such as skiing swim walking so Pittsburgh is a very good place to enjoy in the whole year. In addition I often read books listen music or watch TV at home if I have free time because these things let me feel relaxed. Finally I want to say that I am enjoying studing English at ELI and so happy to make many foreign friends I hope to spend a wonderful time with everbody.
