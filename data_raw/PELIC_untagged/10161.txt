In 2003 when I went to Rome I had some trouble when my visa card didn't work at most of the places there. I had little cash money because I spend a lot of it to buy many souvenirs. I knew my credit didn't work in last night before I left. That happened when I tried to by some of the traditional crafts from a store. I really surprised when the casher told me that it didn't work. I looked for any ATM there but unfortunately it didn't work too. Then I asked my friend to land me a little money to pay my bills. After that time I use 2 credit cards and carry much cash money with a lot of travel checks.
