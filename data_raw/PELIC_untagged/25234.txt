If the kids hadn't locked Margot in the closet she would have seen the sun the sun that she had been waiting and longing for. All the kids were excited for the sun to come out but not as excited as Margot was. Margot had seen the sun before. She knew what the sun looked like she knew how warm it was. But it was a long time ago. It was seven years ago. Since then Margot has been waiting for it to come out again. If Margot had seen the sun I think it would have made her so happy. She would have felt the warmness of it's rays once again it's lemon like shape that lit the whole world just for an instant.
