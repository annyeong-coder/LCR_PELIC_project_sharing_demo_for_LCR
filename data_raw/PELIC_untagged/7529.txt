The number of fast food restaurants has increased quickly. For example we can see Mc Donald almost all over the world. Even though there are many kinds of restaurants where we can eat original foods they serve fast food restaurants never disappear. There are three main reasons for the success of fast food restaurants price quality and convenience. First reason is the price of fast food restaurants. Although there are small differences of the prices the prices are not so expensive. For example if I don't have enough money and try to find a restaurant where I can eat within my money I tend to choose fast food restaurants because the restaurants show their prices in front of the restaurant and I can know the prices before I enter the restaurant. Second reason is their quality of foods. We can eat same foods in fast food restaurants all over the world. Even though their foods are not so delicious we can guess the quality of foods. For example I have never been disappointed at the quality of foods when I travel abroad and go to Mc Donald. Whenever I go I can eat almost same taste of foods in the restaurant. Third reason is convenience of the restaurants. We don't have to wait for a long time before we start eating. Moreover we can buy foods and eat outside the restaurants. For example when I don't have enough time for lunch I often choose a fast food restaurant. If I choose another restaurant I can't guess how long I should spend in the restaurant. When I travel by car I sometimes use fast food restaurants because I can eat foods in the car and save my time. In conclusion there are three main reasons why fast food restaurants can succeed. We can eat same foods at almost the same prices wherever we go. I suppose the number of fast food restaurants will not decrease because any other restaurants can't replace them.
