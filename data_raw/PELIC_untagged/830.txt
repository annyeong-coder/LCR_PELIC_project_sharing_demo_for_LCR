My best friend in ELI is Julien who is from France. He is a 25 year years old guy who has a blond hair and blue eyes. He studied cinema in France where he has a family. He came to ELI to improve his English which he will do his PhD about. He lives with a roommate who went to France once to learn French. His roommate is American who is doing his major in University of Pittsburgh. Julien and him get along well together. They always speak French when they are together which I love to listen a lot. I like listening Julien speaking English as well which he still have the French accent. Julien who is going back to France on January told me that he want to visit Istanbul where I live when he returns to France. He is a really good friend who I enjoy being together. I think I will miss his friendship when I return to Turkey which is on 22nd of October.
