Yes!absolutely I have a unforgetable experience abot achievement. To be honst I am the person who want ahieve the goal. In my memory when I was a teenager I learned piano. Every sumer we have a test about what the lever we are. Because of the study in school. I have a few time to learned piano. To improve the skill about the piano. But the time was upon. I was so anxious about that. My teacher who taught me piano found this. She encourage me to practise. She made a schudrual for me. To be honst I want give up. I think don't have hope to pass the exam. But I insit on . Everyday I played the piano six hours. Lastly I successed !i as so happy. I think what difficult you meet . You must insit your goal. Then you will win. . !come on!
