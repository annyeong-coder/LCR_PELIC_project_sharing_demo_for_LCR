22. March. 2007 ANON_NAME_0 Final assignment Ch. 3 2Nd version 5030 Centre avenue 363 Pittsburgh PA 15213 20. March. 2007 Dear Jaegeun I have a plan to buy a new digital camera because my former digital camera is broken why I dropped it into water . I know that it was a too silly mistake so I regretted my mistake too much. But you know that I will really need a digital camera to take a picture when I travel to any other cities or countries after this semester. So I decide that I will buy a new camera. I went to shopping mall to look for a camera what is adequate for me and I selected two products. I consider buying either Sony DSC W55 or HP R927. So I compared their differences. First DSC W55 its cost is 200 is chipper than the cost of HP R927 what is 300. Actually I have enough money to buy anyone. But I think that buying the first one is more economical than buying second one. Second I compared design of both DSC W55 and R927. In fact when I saw their designs I couldn't find large differences between DSC W55 and R927. They have the colors of silver and similar weights so they almost look like same model. They only have small difference about LCD screen size because DSC W55 has a 2. 5 LCD screen but R927 has a 3 screen. But I think that this difference is not an important problem to take pictures. Third they have just little differences about their feature. DSC W55 has 3x optical zoom 7. 5 Mega pixels for picture quality and a 56 mega bites of internal memory. In contrast R927 has 3x optical zoom 8. 2 Mega pixels for picture quality and a 35 mega bites of internal memory. So they have same optical zoom ability and little differences about picture quality and internal memory. But anyhow I need an extra memory chip because both of internal memories are too small to keep many pictures so capacity of ineternal memory is not important to choose a digital camera. And both of picture qualities also don't have large difference. As a result I decide to buy a DSC W55 when I compared both of them. If you have other opinions about buying digital camera or you know other digital camera which has better condition than DSC W55 please tell me about the digital camera. Sincerely
