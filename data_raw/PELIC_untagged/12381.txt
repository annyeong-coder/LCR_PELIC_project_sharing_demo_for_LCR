On April 15 Tom Higgins opened a new restaurant at Benson University. He excited to open his own restaurant and he prepared so many things. After he set up everything for his restaurant he expected many people would come to his restaurant. Unfortunately after few months his restaurant became poorly. There are two main reasons that Tom's restaurant was doing poorly. First before he opened the restaurant he did not consider money therefore his restaurant failed. Although he rented suitable space on Restaurant Row he wasted time renovating and painting before he opened the restaurant. He did not consider future he ended up overpaying. As a result of overpaying he did not have enough money to do much advertising. Second because he did not plan well before opening his restaurant his restaurant was doing poorly. Due to the bad planning he did not have enough money to hire professional cooks. He just hire few students make them cook. Also as a consequence of many stringent qualifications like no bare feet no children under age 5 many costumers hard to enter his restaurant. He wanted to make the great restaurant. Unfortunately he did not plan well before opening restaurant therefore he failed.
