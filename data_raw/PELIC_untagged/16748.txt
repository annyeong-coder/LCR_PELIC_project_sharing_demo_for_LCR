I met my best friend Rana at the ELI last semester while I was waiting for my turn to have the Michigan Test of English Language Proficiency. She is the sister of a friend of my sister in law. Unfortunately we weren't at the same level. So we had different classes but we were meeting every lunch break and between classes sometimes. So we often saw each other outside classes. We usually spent our time enjoying delicious food in different types of restaurants and going shopping together. I had a scary episode with her one night when we went to a movie theater. After the movie was finished we went to a really far bus stop and we didn't know that there was one just next to the movie theater which made us miss the bus while we were walking between the two bus stops. It was around 11 P. M. And the next bus will come after 45 minutes because it was a Saturday night and there weren't a lot of buses. We were waiting at a bus stop which is in front of closed stores and there were two guys who were moving around us in their car. It was really scary. I had to call my brother to pick us up. After 10 minutes he came and we delivered my friend to her home and then we went back home. It was totally unforgettable episode.
