Hawaii it is the paradise. There is the beach the white sand and the sunlight. A bounch of people they are lying to get taan and beside them pineapple juice and the other swimming and you hear the maxican music and some people dance on the rhythms. The kids they are trying to build A palace by the sand. There is a little wend touch your skin.
