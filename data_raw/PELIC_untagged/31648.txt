Cell Phones in the Classroom Over the past few years technology has started to change many aspects of our live. A cell phone is one of the most important inventions that people use everyday. In addition to communication businessmen use it to manage their businesses and students use the cell phone to access to the Internet and to search information. Despite the fact that the cell phone is the best companion of students in schools I believe that using cell phones should not be allowed in classes. Some people claim that students should be allowed to use their cell phones to look for information or to keep in touch with their families. To a certain extent they are right however many students use the cell phones in classes for things that are not beneficial for them. Instead of focusing on the teacher's explanation they text their friends check facebook and email. In addition if they want to use the cell phone urgently they can wait until the class is finished. In conclusion students in high schools and even in colleges should not be allowed to use cell phones in classes even for important things. Finally I suggested that schools should impose punishments on the students who use cell phones in classes.
