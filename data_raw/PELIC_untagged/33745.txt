There are no soul mates out there. Most people keep saying that words. But not for me anymore when I found her. The soul mate is a person with whom we have a feeling of comfort affinity and compatibility. Somi who is my wife now is the love of my life. The person who I trust. She has a lot of characteristics which forced me to fall in love with her. She is quite smart kind and well educated. We always planned for our life together and share a lot of memories. Today I think a lot of things that we planned have been achieved when we arrived to Pittsburgh.
