When I was younger I used to eat too much but now I pay attention for my weight. Before marriage I ate meal that my mother cooked now I have to make for myself every day. After marriage I lived with my husband and did any things with him. Before that I used to walk with my family. But now I live in Pittsburgh for studying English. In Taiwan I used to shop in department every month but now I go to shop in big mall by bus when I have free time.
