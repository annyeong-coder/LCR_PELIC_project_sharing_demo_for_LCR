My Dream Vacation My dream vacation is traveling all over the world by a luxury liner. The liner is supposed to have everything passengers need such as nice compartments restaurants a pool a library an exercise room a hairdresser and various kinds of activities and entertainments. We won't be bored while we are on board. It's like a moving town. What I really want to do is just to read books over drinking cocktails and nap by the pool in a lot of sunshine when I'm tired of reading. There is nothing else I want more than those. Maybe some people might say they can do the same thing at home. However it's important for me that the liner is moving toward somewhere and that I'm far from my place. The cruise will make me feel great because I will be experiencing my dream vacation on this trip. Unfortunately I think this vacation won't have happened by the end of my life. A cruise like this costs a lot so I definitely can't afford to do that. It'll never happen to me. Although I know it's really difficult to make this trip come true it's still my dream vacation.
