I am going to talk about how I met my husband. I knew him when we were studying medicine in Mexico. When I saw him for the first time he was talking with a friend. We took the same classes in our first semester. While he was on vacation he decided to change to another group. After that we did not share any classes. I met him when I was 17 years old. After six months of knowing each other he asked me to be his girlfriend. He asked me that while we were celebrating my sister's birthday. We were together for a long time in Mexico. Unfortunately he had to go back to the United States to start a residency. While he was starting his Internal Medicine residency I was studying in Mexico for my boards. I was accepted into an anesthesiology residency when he was finishing his second year. When he was finishing his training he asked me to marry him. I got married while I was finishing my anesthesiology residency.
