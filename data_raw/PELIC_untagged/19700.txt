I think internet it is not good place to meet a romantic partner. First I think internet outbreak to all kinds of people some ok and other not so. Second often you can't understand what really because you can't see the partner. Third in internet you can't know some guy honest with you because he she can disclose only good qualities of personality. Sometimes my friends have told me how angry they were about all fibs from their online partner. In short I have clear opinion about online dating it's not good place and some times can be dangerous if I listening to the press news.
