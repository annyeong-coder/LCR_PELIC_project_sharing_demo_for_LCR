My new study habit MOst people have their own rootines when they study. For example I must lock my door before I start to write. If I don t lock my door I can't study do homework or Write. This is a new study habit I do in pittsburgh. Also I need a cup of milk as well. I also like when my surroundings are messy. For instance having all of my books with me help me to focus. My study routine is very important to me.
