Topic 1 Books Movies There are many similarities between reading a book and watching a movie in that both of them try to tell a story and give some information but also both of them have many differences. So many directors have taken books and made many movies such as 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'Harry Potter'. When the directors try to change from a book to a movie they have to know what is an important factor and how to enhance a story. Most of all the most advantage in a book is that the book can maximize person's imagination by revealing first a little of information about a story and finally solving all the questions about the story. In contrast a director in a movie can use a lot of skills such as sounds gestures of actors and high technology which make the movie look like a reality. For example in The Lord of the Rings as a movie we can watch the scene in which numberless people elves and skeletons fight each other which make people feel in the movie the reality. In the book we cannot accept the scene well and even we feel ambiguous.
