When I came to Pittsburgh I wanted to eat Korean food so I was looking for the best Korean restaurants. But I was disappointed that I couldn't found the best Korean restaurants in Pittsburgh. At that time my friend ANON_NAME_0 a student in ELI invited me to his home for dinner. In fact I didn't believe that he had good cooking skills. However I changed my mind when I ate the best Korean meal. I've ever had at his house. And we drank some Soju which is a kind of general alchohol drink in Korea. After that we went to the Peterson Event Center to play a game of racquetball. That day I had a good time with my friend Changyoung and I thought that he made the best meal for me. He is my one of the best friends in Pittsburgh.
