Although it is difficult to decide the best meal I have ever had I remember the meal which I ate at home after traveling Europe for 20 days was delicious. My friend and I took a trip to celebrate our university's graduation when we were 22 years old. During that travel we ate a lot of traditional cuisines such as Germany sausages pizzas and a cheese fondue. They were really tasty and also I got good experiences which I could touch another cultures. However at the end of traveling we missed Japanese meals because they were usually fatty for us. So when I came back to home I asked my mother to cook a Japanese pot cooking meal which is called nabe . Nabe is a dish cooked in an earthen pot at the table it's very good because we put a lot of ingredients into that pot. We use some kinds of fishes such as sermons shrimps and cods chicken tofu napa I don't know how to say in English Chinese cabbage and some other vegetables. By mixing ingredients' flavors that meal becomes really tasty. Although this is not a special and an expensive meal at that time I felt happiness.
