From my perspective the most effective ways are Facebook and commercials. One method that has grown among teens these days is the obsessive use of Facebook so I believe that advertising any product on Facebook will lead to enormous success and will spread as lightening between teens. If we use the Facebook we will raise the brand awareness especially that number of adults who use the Facebook is increasing. Likewise commercials have strong impact on family members without exception for example McDonalds is well known all over the world due to the huge number of commercials and honestly everybody loves McDonalds.
