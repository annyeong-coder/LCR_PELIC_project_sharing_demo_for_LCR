When I was child I was cooperating with my brothers to help our mother because we didn't have sisters. We were contesting to do our chore especially who can wake up earlier than the others and can prepare the breakfast before going school. You can not imagine how mush my mother loves us. One day I woke up very early about 4 o'clock and I had prepared the breakfast then I had changed my clothes to go to school before all my brothers. The thing that had gotten me nervous and angry that when my mother woke up and asked me why did you wake up early to day is a holiday . I didn't know I should lough or not. I requested her that do not tell my brothers. What surprised me that my brother knew what happened.
