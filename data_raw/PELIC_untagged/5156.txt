I have two hobbies listening music and reading books. Since I was 10 years old I have joined a brass band as a saxophone player for 6 years. I wasn't interested in playing music at the beginning but I have enjoyed all activities with the members of the band. After I quitted the band I have been enjoying listening music instead of playing instruments. And I have loved books before I learn reading. My mother has read me some picture books everyday while I couldn't read by myself yet. Soon after I came to read the picture books by myself and I have read them again and again every day. So far I have been reading many books and those have give me a lot of fun. But after I started to work I have been too busy to read books instead of textbooks and papers. Now I have a lot of time and I am studying reading skills in English so I have been reading some newspapers since I came to Pittsburgh 2 month ago.
