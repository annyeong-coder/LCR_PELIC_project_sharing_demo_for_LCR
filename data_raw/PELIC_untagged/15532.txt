I think the meaning of lose an accent on this question may be some kind of absorbing in new thing or assimilating at new thing. If someone is placed to a new situation he or she wants to adapt himself to new thing like that. After that they lose their own original characters. For Yolanda lose an accent is also the same meaning. It means Yolanda couldn't show her original character because of her mother's excessive anticipation.
