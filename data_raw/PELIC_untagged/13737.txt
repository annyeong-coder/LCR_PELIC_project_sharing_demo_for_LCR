When I came from Saudi Arabia my hometown to study English in America here in Pittsburgh I was really shocked I don't know why but maybe from the new society that I had to live with. However there are many differences between my country and U. S. A such as the culture like the eating habits clothing and there are few similatites such as the cost of living. Saudi Arabia has unique and different clture from the US almost in every thing. However many Americans when they study or hear about the Saudi culture it will sound strange to them especially when they hear about the eating habits in Saudi Arabia because when we invites someone to eat dinner in our home we usually put the food on the floor and we use the right hand to eat but the people in the US they usually put the food on the table and start eating by using knifes and forks. Also the Saudies usually wear what we call it ''THOPE'' it's made from fabric and it can be any color and we must wear it in specific places and in certain times for e. G. If I'm going to visit my friend in his house in the mosque school so I can't wear any thing else that I want. However in US they usually wear suits for spacial event and jeens when they go to work. Saudi Arabia and U. S. A are really rich countries because they have lot of oil. Also Saudi Arabia is the highest number of selling oil to the world and the U. S. A have very huge oil that they can use it for the next 100 years. Also the Ameican Doller and the Suadi Rial always related together if the Doller goes up the Rial goes up also which made it conected together. Finally it was really difficult at the begining to live in a different society and I had to deal with new people that they have their own culture but by the time I got use to it . On another hand the cost of living almost the same in both country which made it more easier for me to be familer with this new life.
