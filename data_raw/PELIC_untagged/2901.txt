My ideal life needs only three things. First of all financially independent life is most important to get other things. Of course money is not my final purpose. But financial support is big part of happy life. Even thought I have lots of money if I don't know about current issues like economics I'll lose all my money in a second. So I want to have huge library. I want to learn until to death. Without any knowledge human beings are nothing. Finally I want to have family who have forever happiness. With these three things can make my life perfect.
