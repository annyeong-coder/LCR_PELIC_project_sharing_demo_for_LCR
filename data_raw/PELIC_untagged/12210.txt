Once my friend went to our neighbouring state in search of a job. He went alone and it was already late when he reached Chennai. One of his friends offered to come and pick him up. But he couldn't contact and tell him that he would arrive late. So when he reached there he couldn't find his friend. He didn't know whether he should wait his friend to come because he couldn't contact him still then. Finally he decided to go. He was sure that he could find his friend's residence in some way. When he had come out of the station a taxi driver offered to help him. He asked the driver whether he knew the green strret. The driver told him that he knew every nick and corner. My friend was so happy. But the driver failed to find the place. It was too late and my friend decided to return home. So the driver took him back to the station. When they returned the station my friend looked for his wallet in his pocket to pay for the taxi. He was surprised to know thathe lost his wallet. The driver asked him how much money he had in his wallet. He replied that there was almost 1000 rupees. My friend was so shocked. He didn't know what to do next. But he felt sure that the driver may help him because he was such a nice guy. The driver again offered his help. What my friend admired about him was that he not only gave him a free lift but also paid for his ticket and gave him some money for the trip. My friend was so greatful. Before leaving Chennai he gave the driver his ph. And address. He also asked the driver what his name was. He disagreed to tell his name. Then my friend asked whether he would mind giving him his address. The driver responded that he won't mind helping others and he didn't want any reward in return. The next day when my returned home he told the whole story. We also admired the stranger. But the next day my friend got a message from the stranger Sir there wasn't 1000 rupees in your wallet it was only 600. I thout that you were honest. I'm sorry.
