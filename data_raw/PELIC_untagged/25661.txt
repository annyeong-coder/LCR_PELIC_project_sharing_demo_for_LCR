My house is very quiet and beautiful so I feel relaxed and calm when I am in it. We have a basement that is so dark and scary but it is so interesting and incredible for me. Our house has 4 rooms 1 kitchen and 2 bathrooms. It has so many windows in all 4 sides. There are one room in the left corner and 2 rooms in the right corner. At the end of the room there is a bathroom and in the front of that there is a kitchen. I feel relaxed because when I see my house I remember my childhood and I feel nostalgic. I was born and I was grow up there. It is a very wonderful house. Also it is far from street so there isn't any noise in it that is because I feel calm when I am in it. You can sleep for a long time without any worries. Also my sister's anniversary held in this house so my house is the most brilliant and terrific place that I have ever been. I really miss it now. I hope to go back soon to see my house again.
