In the 1920s America observed a life style unlike the present one. For example drinking was prohibited yet everyone who wanted to buy a drink knew where to get one. Another difference is that there was organized crime that tremendously prevailed in the cities and the police were not able to control such crime. Moreover musicians like Louis Armstrong became young people's favorites as many of them quit classical music and turned to Jazz music. In the twenties women flappers tended to cut off their hair and shorten their skirts. America's break with the past. From Kathleen Yancey English 102 Supplemental Guide 1989 25
