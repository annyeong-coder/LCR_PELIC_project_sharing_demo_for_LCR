My lifestyle changed when I came to the U. S. I used to drive a car in my country but now I use buses. I used to go to the gym but now I do not have any free time. I never used to have american friends but now I have five american friends. I did not use to be interested in american football but now I watch the game every week. I used go to the barber shop when I wanted to shave but now I shave myself at home.
