I have one experience about a wrong phone call from stranger. The phone rank when I was sleeping last weekend. I pick up the phone and said Hello but responded. As a result of being sleepy I said If you do not say something I can not figure out who you are. Then that guy hang up the phone and call me back a few minutes later. She said Please hold on I'm so sorry to woke you up and can I sign up for the English class Her words made me so angry and I said sorry today is Sunday I cannot do anything because it my weekend do you mind call me back on weekday
