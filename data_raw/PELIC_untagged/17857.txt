Variety is the spice of life means that trying something new revitalize a life. Three years ago. I worked for more than 12hours in a day. I was always busy. I was a workaholic. So I was exhausted by hard work. I found that the national classical korean music institute was near my office. There They had an evening class for adults. I took the class for leaning a korean musical instrument Haegum. I attended twice a week for a year. I tried not to miss th class. At end of the class my classmates and I held a small concert. It was difficult to attend the class after work but my stress from work was released. Learning a musical instrument was very interesting and was like a vitamin for me.
