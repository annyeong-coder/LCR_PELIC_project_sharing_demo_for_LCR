When I was 11 I got to know an entertainer's phone number by chance who was my favorie star. My friend talked me into to try out whether the number was correct. After thinking over I decided to call him. The dial tone went on for 1 minute and I almost gave the call up. As soon as I took a motion to hang up the phone very low voice came up from the phone. I was too nervous to keep on saying what I prepared in advance. I was just going over this words Hi are you XXX in a very strange way of talking. He didn't figure out what I said finally the short call ended up with failure.
