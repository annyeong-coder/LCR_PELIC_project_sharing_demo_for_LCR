Coming to the U. S has a major effect on routine. While in my country Friday was the last day in the weekend in U. S it is the first day in the week. Friday is now considered the best day in the whole week. It gives me an access to my personal non academic life where I can finally relax. On the other hand Sunday gives me the exit of this life and prepares me to the 'hard work'. On Friday I start my day with a sleepy happy thought that the week is finally over. I go back home after a long day at school and begin to reshape my philosophy about coming to the U. S for the purpose of studying. I give my self all sorts of justifications to do stupid things and waste my time in the next 2 days. Sunday however is a day full of revelations of how stupid I was by wasting my time instead of working on the pile of assignments I have. This day I made a very strict schedule for the rest of the week which I never applied. I talk myself for an hour or two into quit punishing myself and get to work immediately. By the end of the day I feel exhausted so I sleep like a baby. Friday and Sunday may seem similar to a lot of people but to me they are completely different. Whereas one gives me a door to escape my serious life the second drag me into it again.
