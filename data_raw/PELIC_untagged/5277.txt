Studying in USA is very interesting here is some of my advice that may help you in your studying life in USA. First you need to make a schedule for your day because the schedule is going to help you to choose a good time for studying. Second you should always do your homework then try to practice what you learned in the class with your friend or with on American. In addition you need also to find Native English speakers because they can help you in speaking. The most important thing is to practice because with no practice you will forget quickly. Finally I think these are the most important advice to help new students.
