I like my home very much because I always feel very comfortable while I am in the house. When I come back home usually the first time I do is light my home up and turn my radio up. In my home my room is sharing with my other sisters but I still have my own desk in my room. That is mean I still have my own area therefore I can do everything I want in my area. For example I can put up the posters on the wall in front of my desk. And every year my family will try to touch up our house. Usually we will tear down the old poster and then put up the new poster. Besides we also straighten up our home while my throw out all the garbage in our home. Even if our home is not big we always can cheer up each other when we talking playing and sharing in our home. I always think my home is the most warn place in the world.
