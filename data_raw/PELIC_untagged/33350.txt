The most significant event in my life is exchanging violin to viola. I had learned violin for 7 years. I always had been trying to practice hard but I couldn't because the sound is too high and it bothered me. When I played the violin my ears were sore. I loved music but hate violin sound. At the jury I had made big mistake. It had become my last jury with violin. After this happened I had wanted quit the violin. But my parents wanted me to study music. When they exchanged my violin to viola I thought I might hate the viola also because it looks similar. But the sound is totally different. When I played the viola I had already fallen in love with viola. I really liked the sound and the resonance. This is the reason why I choose viola as my major. I think this event is the most significant event in my life.
