The best meal experience that I've ever had happened in 2008. I had a job in Taiwan before and every year we always had a budget for a feast in the end of a year during those days my colleagues and I were excited about choosing which one was our ideal restaurant. After a long discussion we decided to go to a famous restaurant whose name is YuanShao which is a renowned restaurant in Taiwan and customers can roast various meats vegetables or seafood. On the day we walked in YuanShao restaurant the store was so neat and tidy and then a waitress guided us to our own booth. Because I never went to the restaurant before the waitress recommended me a meal set which has a plate of salad a bowl of soup a dessert and some ingredients consist of pork beef seafood and vegetable and that is the one which I ordered later. First of all the waitress placed a plate of salad in front of me after I ate it up the waitress swiftly gave me a bowl of cream soup that I chose before the soup was a little sweet and had several piece of dicing tomato inside it tasted really delicious. After I finished off the cream soup I started to roast meat and vegetables and then the waitress also taught us how to roast the ingredients and what the best way is to cook those different ingredients. The waitress is so professional in roasting various meat and seafood because the food that I roasted through her help was really yummy and juicy. After we consumed all the food on our table we felt so satisfied and full. On the way to home we just couldn't help ourselves to discuss the ways that the waitress taught us and asked one another which dish were the most delicious. In my opinion the fresh ingredients and professional service are the crucial reasons that why the restaurant is so popular in Taiwan. If I had chance I would like to have meal in YuanShao restaurant again!
