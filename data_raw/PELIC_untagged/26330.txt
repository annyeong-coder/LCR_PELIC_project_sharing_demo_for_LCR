One of the beautiful day is the day of the wedding in Saudi Arabia. In this special day the bride and the groom become together officially. It is the moment where the couple move to a new life. In that day the couple's families friends and relatives join them at a hall party including food and drink. In my town preparation and planning may take for six to twelve months before the wedding celebration.
