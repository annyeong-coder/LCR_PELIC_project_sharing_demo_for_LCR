Every religion has concepts and rules that people who convert this religion have to follow these instructions. One of the Islamic instructions for women is to wear hijab. Hijab is Arabic word which means to cover or to hide by wearing head scarf . The underlying reason for wearing hijab is to protect women from some men who just think about her as a cheap meat. Muslim women are just allowed to reveal their hair for others women or for closest relatives such as a father a brother a husband or a son. So hijab is required for any Muslim woman at any place any city or any country. At the beginning of twentieth century many Muslim families had to emigrate from home countries to another foreign country. They were looking for jobs and better life. But recently there is a trend in some countries for banning Muslim women wearing hijab which makes this issue controversial. Despite the fact that many countries think hijab should be banned I believe that there are not valid reasons for banning hijab.
