Friends are at least two people who have common interests depending on the location. We can make friends in schools in neighborhoods or in work. The first friends we sometimes make are the friends we make in school. As we leave the house for school we search for someone relaxed to talk to. Hobbies and interests usually drive us toward people with whom we want to make friendship. In the neighborhoods we usually contact or socialize with neighbors and share celebrations festivals and support each other as our relations get stronger. Our friendship with the neighbors let's us keep in touch and drive us to support each other in hardships. In work and job meetings we share opinions with colleagues and when we find common interests with a person we like to see him her a lot. We like to make a friendship with him or her. We may invite each other for lunch or dinner or going to picnics together. However common interests and common hobbies are how we make friends in schools in neighborhoods or in work.
