One of my friend's had a problem three years ago because of his weight. However he couldn't play with us in our soccer team beacuse he gets tired very fast. Also he couldn't even run for long distances. But now he is really skinny so he's able to play anything that he wants to play. However I met him yesterday and he told me that ''being able with you guys is really something great.
