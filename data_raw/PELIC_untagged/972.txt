One of the key persons in my life was my Chinese language teacher in the junior high school. Without his encouragement I would not have had a chance to improve my studying and my life. In Chinese society it is important for parents and teachers to consider you as a good kid and student by higher grades. So with average grades I was not a good student and it made me unhappy. It was crucial that he teach me for a semester. He was not only teaching me the knowledge but also teaching me how to face myself and find my strongest potential. Were he not my teacher I would not care as much about learning today. After his teaching my grades were in the top ten of the school until I finished my college. Besides the grades I was always feeling happy even though sometimes I failed in my studying because I had learned something that was more important than the grade. Had I not met him I would not know life is wonderful even without good grades. I was lucky if not I hadn't have met him and I would not be as happy today.
