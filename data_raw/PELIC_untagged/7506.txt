When I was a high school student I didn't know about my major. I just liked animals so I chose biology for my major. Then I realized that it was not like what I had thought before. But I couldn't change my major because there was nothing I wanted to take as a major. Actually there is no zoology in my country. I should have considered studying abroad. However in those days I was afraid of going far from my home so I stayed at my university.
