Mother Tongue engrosses my attention because Amy Tan's English speaking experience with her mother. It also triggers me the memory about my mother. Amy and I have a parallel language path. She could adapt the way of her mother's English while her friends could understand her mother's English fluctuated from none to 90 percent. Similarly I can understand every mandarin Chinese my mom speaks while my friends give me an implicit answer about my mother's 'bad' accented mandarin Chinese. The article also exhibits Amy's mother had a proclivity for speaking English. Likewise my mother's persistence of speaking mandarin Chinese makes many people feel easy to communicate with her.
