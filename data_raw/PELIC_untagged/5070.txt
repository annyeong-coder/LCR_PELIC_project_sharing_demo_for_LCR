My kitchen is small but it is very useful. As you enter the kitchen through the gate the table is directly front of you. The stove is located in the left corner. Next to the stove is the refrigerator. The faucet is in the middle of the kitchen. There is a cupboard all around the kitchen. As I described you can see my kitchen is very useful.
