When I was twelve years old I was traveling with my family to another country and while we were touring their we saw this Iranian restaurant which looked magnificent from outside. So my family decided that they want to eat in this restaurant. When the waitress gave us the menu I did not like the meals because I thought it was very strange. So I ordered only fries. When the food arrived my family did not like it. However they had ordered a lot of food. All of them start to eat fries with me instead of eating their meals.
