Learning new language is the most interesting thing in my opinion. So there are a few steps you can learn English. First you should read a lot of books in English. Second watching movies in English. Third listening to English news such as CNN. Fourth talking with people in English. Next try do not translate in your native language. Than you should join a conversation group with students who speaking English as a first language. Finally when just start learning a new language you will find that is a wonderful experience when you begin speaking two languages.
