If I become school president I will build a lot of apartments for dorm. Because there are a lot of students who come from different places there all need to find a place for living. Some students complain that it's crowded on the shuttle especially the rainy or snowy days. Therefore I will also set more shuttles if I am the school president. Besides that if I am the school president I will give more funds to every club. Every club needs money to held activities. If they can hold some successful activities there will be much more people know our school. If I become school president I will hold parties each semester. This can improve the communication between students who come from different college departments. Finally if I become school president I will give more practical classes than now. It will be helpful for all of our students after they graduate.
