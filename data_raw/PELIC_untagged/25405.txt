It is common in Saudi's culture that the old son becomes responsible for family and has to face and solve all problems. Unlike the woman who should take care of the children while their parents not in house. But there is a violation against woman because their parents take much care of man! Some people think that old person get responsible. However the others counter this statement. From my experience I'm the second oldest individual in my family and I have a sister who is older than me. Nevertheless I'm responsible for them.
