My friend studies in a grad school in my country. During doing researches she is aware of the importance about Math and English. As results of papers are written by English and her professor have her to use more statistics approach. Therefore she told me that she ought not to have fooled around when she studied in the university. She should have studied hard about Math and English because she is not good at two subjects. She should have memorized large number vocabularies. Also she could have listeneded her teachers advice and not give up.
