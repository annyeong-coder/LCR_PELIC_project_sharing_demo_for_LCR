I live in a big house in Tripoli city so the houses are beautiful and close together. On the afternoon you will see children playing In our street most of the children are friends and will go from house to house playing in the yard. We live in a nice guiet neighborhood and have been blessed to know our neighbors. Most my neighborhoods are very helpful for example if your son is sick and you need to drive him to hospital but you do not have car one of them immediately gives you his car and if you are annoyed from something about one of your neighbors you quickly will find another neighbor solving the problem friendly. In fact we have two houses one in the country and another in Tripoli city. There are advantages from living in the country . The country is more peaceful than the city a little pollution is less crowded than city and the landscapes are very fascinating. For all these resones I would like to live all my life in the countryside because I would like to get back to natural life that we missed it in the cities.
