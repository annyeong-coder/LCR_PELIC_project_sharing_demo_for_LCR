I am now in level 4 . I have got four classes speaking listening writing and grammar . I have studied all of these classes in level 3. I have read a lot of passage to improve my reading skills. Not only that I also have tested my reading speed in a website . I have worked on my vocabulary by memorizing new words. I have not passed the TOEFL yet and this has achieved me to study more. I still have not worked a lot in my writing but this is my next plan. I have listened to many academic lectures hoping that will help me in my next TOEFL.
