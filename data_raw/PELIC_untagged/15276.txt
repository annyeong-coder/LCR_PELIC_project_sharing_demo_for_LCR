The people in Pittsburgh are helpful. Before two months ago I and my friend were shopping and we were carrying heave things. We were moving difficult and slowly. Suddenly a stranger man came toward me and asked me do you need help. After that he put our things in his car and drove to our home. When we asked him why did you do this contribute. He answered before two years at the similar time and location a stranger man helped me while I was like your situation.
