Nuclear weapons have been issued for a long time all over the world. Especially North Korea has threatened many countries with the Nuclear weapons. I think there are several reasons and problems for developing the Nuclear weapons in North Korea. First these days economical situation in North Korea is getting more and more deteriorated. With the threat North Korea is trying to get support from other countries. Second actually South Korea has supported North Koreans in many different ways since Korea divided into two divisions such as giving food money even technology. This is because South Korea wants that North Koreans do not have problems in basic living expenses at least. However North Korea government has not used the support for their citizens. Instead of that the support has been used to develop the Nuclear weapons. It is true that Nuclear weapons cause to serious diseases. In addition it might cause to the destruction of the earth. Therefore we should make an effort North Korea not to develop Nuclear weapons anymore. Also we should try to unify divided territory of Korea.
