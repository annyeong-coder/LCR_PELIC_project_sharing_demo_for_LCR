I met my husband while I was studying master's course. He was one year junior than me and he wanted to come to my lab while students were registering new semester. But my lab was already full of other students when he registered. So he could not help choosing other lab. But strangely enough he came to my lab's reception party for the new students. I thought that he was so far eager to come to my lab even if he didn't register. At the reception party he and I talked about many things such as our major a dream and so on. At that time I felt he was a very clever and nice man. After three weeks from the reception party I started to go out with him. And then I knew the fact that in fact he didn't want to come to my lab. He planned to register my lab only to ask out with me. Although there were some crises while I was going out with him for six years I got married with him. And now I have a cute baby boy.
