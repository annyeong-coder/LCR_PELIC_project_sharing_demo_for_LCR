We enjoy music with various musical instruments. First we have rhythm instruments like drum and bongo. These are called primary instruments and have primitive shape and performance. The sound of these is similar to heart beating. We can find these instruments even in the primitive tribe. If you had a chance to listen to the African traditional music you could find the rhythm instrument plays an important role. Second we have key instruments like piano and organ. These are much more developed form of instruments because we can express the broad octave and chord with this. Third there are string and wind instruments. They are kinds of key instruments but are divided by the way of making sound. Violin viola cello and base are string instruments. They make sound by vibration of strings with a bow and have their own octave so we can choose the proper string instrument by the score. Wind instruments make sound by blowing breath through the instruments and are divided into wooden and metal according to what they are made from. There are flute and oboe in wooden wind instruments. Trumpet horn and clarinet are metal wind instruments.
