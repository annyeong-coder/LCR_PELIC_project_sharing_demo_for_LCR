Topic The view out your window the view out window of my house is very beautiful. When you look through the window the first thing you notice is large trees. Behind the trees there is Aiken Ave. A red house is located Behind the Aiken Ave. You can also look a tall church on the right but the church is far away. On your left you can see Ellsworth Ave and UPMC shady side. You can also see many trees and really beautiful woman who are jogging.
