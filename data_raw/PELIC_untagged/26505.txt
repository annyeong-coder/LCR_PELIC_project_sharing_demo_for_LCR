THE CREATIVE SPIRIT According to author children are eager to learn and develop skills about subjects. I believe the same things because as we age we become to not like schools. We think that they over control us and put restrictions. For example like in the passage schools put rules for us and sometimes make us do impossible things. It should be so much better if schools try to make education fun instead of sicken us from education. Dr Amabile's research has identified some creative killers such as surveillance evaluation competition and pressure. I think children are more natural than adults. When a child is under observation creativity goes underground and hides making kids worry about how others judge what they're doing. I clearly remember when I was in elementary school I felt same things. When I went to kindergarten I draw picture without copy. That was really nice. But in the school we got some copy of famous painter. Finally I agree with this author. Family and schools shouldn't be restrictive on the children. Children should be allowed to progress at their own rate
