When I was a child I had a neighbor who was very rich. He had a big house five cars and very big factory which produced chain. Although they were very rich they were treating people very kindly they never looked down on people. One day a person who was the worker his factory tried to rob his factory. While he was robbing my neighbor caught him and took him to police. After he was arrested my neighbor found out something about the man who tried to rob his factory. He tried to rob his factor because his daughter was sick. As soon as he found out this he gave up his case. After the man was released my neighbor had his daughter treated.
