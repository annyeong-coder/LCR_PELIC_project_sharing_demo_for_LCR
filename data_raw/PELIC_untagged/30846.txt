Fridays and Sundays in the United States are two interesting days. They have a lot of differences and similarities. Friday is usually the last day of school and the beginning of a lovely weekend. Sunday is usually the last day of the weekend and the day that comes before a new school week. On Friday from every week I go to buy food at the strip district unlike Sunday were I mostly stay at home and give time for myself to relax. It is also common that I spend Sunday cleaning my room and arranging the apartment. On contrast every Friday I spend most of the time hanging out with my friends. Having a nice weekend attributed to spending good time with friends. On the other hand sometimes Fridays and Sunday looks the same to me. In both days I have the freedom to plan them as I like. I choose to do my homework on Fridays as I do it on Sundays too. On Fridays I cook food at home the same as Sundays where I cook at home too. I am biased against going to cinema in these days. My philosophy is to have rest and enjoy Fridays and Sundays in relaxing.
