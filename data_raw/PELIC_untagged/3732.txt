More classmates don't like raining day. They often think it is rain to make blue cold wet and humidity. Conversely It's a really good time when I'm sitting in a chair and watching the people outside or hearing the sound of rain Eui Hyun who is also my classmate said. I agreed because an imaging picture was emerging from my mind when I read the sentence. In fact I enjoy raining day too much. In a raining day I like to take a relaxing. Sometimes using a same way of Eui Hyun I'm setting in a coach drinking a cap of hot tea viewing more people behaviors and guessing their feeling such as blue happy. In addition during the spring season all plants grow up after rain. I remember my country has a proverb spring's rain values more than Olive oil. Personally raining day is relaxing day raining day is making new life' day I like it.
