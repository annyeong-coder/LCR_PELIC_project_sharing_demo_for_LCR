In 2004 I took the university entry exam which was taken by 1 5 million students. I was successful and I deserved to apply to the university. My university was in Istanbul where is the most crowded city in Turkey. When I was at the university I was staying in a dormitory. There was a quite bit distance between my school and the dormitory. So I used to sleep in the bus. One day I got on the bus after the lesson as usual. There was one empty seat I saw there and sat down. There was a girl next to me. While I was going to the dormitory I fell asleep but my head was on her shoulder. When we were approaching the dormitory she woke me up. I realized where my head was. I excused her and we started to talk each other. She was staying the same dormitory as I stayed. I asked her to have a dinner together after we got off the bus. She accepted it. Two months later we started to date.
