Does your best friend have to be someone who is the same way that you are I don't think so I think the best friendships are the ones in which the friends have a different personality but are interested or likes the same things. Actually my best friend is my cousin who is one year older than me her name is Arizbeth. I can say that she's my best friend because I really enjoy the time we're together she inspires confidence in me and she is a really good listener. We have been doing things together since we used to be babies first we went to the same kinder garden which was near from my grandparent's house and we used to have lunch together and then we went to the same elementary school secondary school and high school. Also we went to the same academy jazz which is one of the most important academies in my state for 10 years. We both love to dance and we use to have the same friends. I use to call her Ari and she is a person who I love and I really appreciate her mother whom is my aunt always says to us that we are cousins because she never couldn't handle with us as sisters. Our favorite place is a beach which is called camahuiroa and we love to go there because is a place that we can be quiet and hear the ocean or we can be with music and dancing in the beach. So in conclusion my best friend for me is a person who inspire confidence in me is a great listener and I can have fun with and just be myself.
