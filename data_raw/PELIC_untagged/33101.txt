When I was a university student I signed up the club that I did volunteer in the orphanage. I met my husband there. I was teaching orphans and talking a lot with them to be a friend. I was dating him for two years. We have been living together since 2009. I have been going through conflict after living with him in the same house. Sometimes it bothers me because I'm getting stressed on account of arguments wiht him. However he is one of the most importatnt person in my life because we are peers to solve difficulties we have experienced and to overcome roadblocks in the USA.
