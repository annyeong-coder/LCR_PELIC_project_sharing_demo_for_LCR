It is very hard to decide which type of personality you are. I consider myself kind of sensor person who uses previous experience to make conclusions. I remember when I went to one of the training center to arrange schedule of the classes that day the secretary who is responsible for making schedule let me wait for about an hour meanwhile I was in the lobby where I have to wait for my turn. After that she told me she had to leave. That time I was about to cry because I considered that as a personal insult. Also in some cases I tend to be extrovert and others introvert it depends on the situation that associates the event. For example if I have a personal problem which make me tend to be alone and have no desire for sharing people their talks even who want to. Other times I feel extrovert . In general it is hard to determine a template whose sides are ridge and decide accurately which kind of personality you resemble the most. Every template has a room for difference.
