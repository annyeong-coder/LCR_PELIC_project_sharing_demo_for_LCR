By 1996 I had been doing a diving course. Before I took the course I had been swimming a lot. For getting the driver's license I had to studied a little bit of medicine because diving is not as easy as seem to be. Before I finished the course I had never considered giving up because while I was doing it I was enjoying it. After I had got my diving's license I went to dive with all my classmates. It was a funny trip. If I had time I would like to dive again.
