1 When I finish my ELI study I have to apply a master degree. 2 I'm going to stay at Pittsburgh if I can be admitted by University of Pittsburgh. 3 Unless I can be admitted by Carnegie Mellon University I'm going to pursue a master degree in University of Pittsburgh. 4 I'm going to apply other five universities in case I can not be admitted by University of Pittsburgh. 5 Because my parents asked me to get a master degree I came to the US. 6 After this term I'm going to travel to Puerto Rico. 7 I start applying universities as soon as I finish the GRE exam. 8 Once I get a master degree I'm going back to China. 9 I need to practice a lot before I take the GRE exam. 10 I have to stay here for a long time although I miss my family.
