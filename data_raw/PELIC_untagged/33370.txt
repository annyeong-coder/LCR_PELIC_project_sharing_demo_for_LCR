To live in leisureville! No. Even though it is very comfortable responsibility in our life is more important than having carefree. I agree that people need to have some leisure however that does not mean to spend the entire life in a facility separate from our society. If you ponder for a moment our life deserve to live in it. Even if there are some negative sides the positive sides can take all the negatives away. Spending time with our families and friends or enjoying your time with your children can be a real leisureville. In my opinion the person who understand his life very well can make a permanent leisureville whenever and wherever he or she wants.
