In my opinion increasing tourism in my country to double next 20 years is very useful. First of all I acknowledge my country was isolated from the world for 10 years ago so a lot of tourists don't know my country. If that happened it will unveil my country's fact about wonderful and spotless places for tourism. Second this growth reforms the relationship between my country and other countries. Finally the crucial event will pounce money and improve my country's financial position.
