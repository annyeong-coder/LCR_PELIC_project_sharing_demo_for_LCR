In 2000 we had found a killed man in our neighborhood. He wasn't known by anyone of our residents. After 2 minutes the police showed up! I surprised since no one called them. I thought they must have been called by someone of our neighbors. Then I asked a police officer how did you know about the crime He said we were called by the criminal himself. At that time the area was covered by the police officers. They were seeking for any evidences. One evidence was found by a young man. He saw a knife had been covered by plenty of blood. The police said this knife was used by the criminal and it was holding by him. After awhile they figured out that the blood which was on the knife was not for the victim. They were manipulated by the criminal. Until this time this case has not been discovered. Everything in this story is unreal
