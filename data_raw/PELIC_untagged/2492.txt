I slept well and didn't feel that I needed to sleep more. But recently I think I lack sleeping time. First of all I'm a wife and a mother of a son. I should take care of him do house chores and make some food for every meal. I had done all these things by myself before I studied in ELI. After being a ELI student I have to do one more thing studying. I realized this is very stressful to me. My son I went to bed together around 9 30pm. After 2 3 hours sleeping I just wake up. I feel tired but my mind makes me wake to do my homework. My son never lets me do homework with him. So I start to clean the room and study. After finishing all these things I go back to sleep again. But yesterday I couldn't get up I dreamed nightmare to do my homework. Everything goes like this. I want to sleep more comfortably and without stress.
