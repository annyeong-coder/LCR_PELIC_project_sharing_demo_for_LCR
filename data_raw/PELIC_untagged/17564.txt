What I like about the US is that most people are helpful. What I like about the US is the fact that people respect the time. One thing I liked most about the US is that the teaching system is practicle. What I like about americans is how they do thier work effeciently. One thing I donot like about the USA is that the weather is crazy. What I do not like about the US is how isolated every one is what I do not like about the US is that the food is turrible.
