I think that friend is someone who is closed to me for a long time. In my case my best friend Jong kook is someone who is a fellow student from elementary school to high school. So he always was with me every time when I was in sorrow and in joy. When I was graduated from university I had difficulty in finding a job for a while. So I was in the blue. At that time I met my best friend who was comforted to me. I gathered myself up together.
