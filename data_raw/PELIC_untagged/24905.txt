My aunt is the favorite painter for me . She made a lot of art . All of them in her home . She stared paint when she was young . My grandmother told me she was tired with her because she usually painted in walls of their home . Now she studying doctoral about the art in Britain . One work of art I like is encaustic in my home my aunt gave to me when I graduated from the University . She painted landscaped of the area I love it . She painted the seam houses tress lakes and summer sun in the area . The drawing tools she used in my favorite art are plat pencil color wax and some engineering tools . I like this art because it is about the favorite area for me and it is gift from my aunt .
