Dear Confused I understand your problem. It usually happens when two persons from different countries want to get marry together because they have different cultures especially Asia and America. First your parents may think that your boyfriend is not sincere so you should bring your boyfriend to meet your parents and let them to create their relationship. Moreover you should teach your boyfriend to know about your customs and language before meeting with your parents. It will show that your boyfriend has intent and it will impress your parents. Your parents may change their mind after they know more about your boyfriend. I trust your parents will understand your love if they sure that your boyfriend is sincere because parents always appreciate to see their children have a good family. Consultant
