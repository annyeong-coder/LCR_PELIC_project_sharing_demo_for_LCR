There are many important things in our lives. However I want to write the three most important things in my life. One thing is a family. For example we have to meet good spouse and bring their children up. So I can rely on my family and I could share our time to make my life better. The second is friends. Except for my family I can help each other. In addition I can share my time to play with. This could take off my everyday stresses. The third is money. Sometimes this could look lest important. But without this we can't live happy life. We are not supposed to live with anything we want to have. I will though struggle to live happily with my family friends and money.
