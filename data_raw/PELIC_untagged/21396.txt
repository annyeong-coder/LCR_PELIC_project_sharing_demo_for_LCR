The first time when I went to the U. S. A my English skill especially conversation skill was awful. I have tried to talk with people in English I think I achieved my goal my skill is reinforced a little bit. Other skills like listening grammer are also improved. The second target was improving my fitness by doing exercise. I have done exercise every third or fourth times a week and now I have good condition. Even I can study for whole day despite the fact that I slept for just 3 hours. The last thing I did is to read books which are written in English. I read Hary porter series and Dan Brown's novel like Angel Demon. These books a little bit hard to understand but it was very interesting.
