I think it is normal to throw away something that is still useablecondition. It is true that one person's trash is another person's treasure. For example I bought one sofa two years ago and I liked it very much. However when I found new cute sofa in a furniture shop I had to throw away the old one even though it was still useable. I tried to find someone who needed it but I couldn't find someone. Although I know it is wasteful to discard useable things we don't have such a custom as Curbside treasure hunters in Japan and we have to discard them unless I can find someone who wants to use them.
