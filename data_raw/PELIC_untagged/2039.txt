Before I came here I thought that learning English would be easier than my country. I tried many times to learn English but every time I haven't taken enough productivity. Even though I spent money and time end of the course I know that I would forget everything fast. There were no enough environments to make practice. The teaching system based on memorizes everything. So that If you don't have enough practice opportunity you forget everything inevitably. Finally I decided that I have to go abroad for English. I thought that it would be better than former experiments. When I came here I saw that there was no big mistake in my thoughts. Even though I had many problems with speaking teachers and Native Americans or understanding the native people at first times I didnt have any intention as give up immediatly. I had to show more performance than in my country because I have been consciousness that this is my last chance. There is no other option or opportunity. Now I believe that I have improved much. I don't have any problems with the other people here. I can understand them more clearly than before. And I hope that everything will be perfect end of the course.
