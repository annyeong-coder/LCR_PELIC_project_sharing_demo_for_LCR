My partner told me there are many different animals in his country. He has ridden horse and camel for sever times. He really likes to ride horse and camel. Also he has fed a camel and a dog for two years. He has taught his dog several skills like sit stop shake hand etc and it has learned the skills very well. He has a lot of happy time with his pets. But now he has to study here. He hasn't seen his pets for a long time he misses them very much. He hopes he can go back to his country next mouth. And he has bought a lot of gifts for his parents and pets.
