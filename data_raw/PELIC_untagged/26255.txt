What made me mad in the last weeks was that Washington State University told me that they did not receive the financial letter although I sent to them a copy of it but they did not accept it because what their policy needs was the original one. Therefore I called my advisor in Saudi cultural mission to emit the letter into the university. After two weeks of waiting I contact the office of admission and they told me that the letter has not arrived yet. At that time I got conditional acceptance upon the completion of the advance level in the ELI from University of New Haven. What I realized that I had many absences which would deprive me from taking the certificate if I started thinking about going to Washington DC in order to take the letter personally. What I did was I called me mother to take a consult. What she advised me was I should request sending the letter into my address and then I could send it into the university by the express mail. Anyway I requested that from the advisor. At the same day one of my friends wanted to go SACM in order to arrange and complete his file. What I happened was that I opposed my mother advise and went with my friend to Washington after finishing my classes in the last Tuesday. Eventually I arrived to SACM and got my letter from them. Before leaving Washington I sent the paper to the university. What surprise me when I came back to my house the next day was that the letter arrived to my mail box. What funny about that was that I should have listened to my mother's consult!
