I bought a car one week ago. The car is great and in a good shape. When I wanted to buy it I took 2 of my friends with me. I wish I hadn't taken them. When they first saw the car they said it is a bad car before even doing a drive test. When I tested the car the car was great and I noticed that it has very low miles. My intuition said take the car and I did. If I hadn't listened to my inner voice I would have lost a great deal. Then I decided to check the car history on CARFAX. I wouldn't have chosen to buy it very quickly if I hadn't checked its history on CARFAX. It was a good deal and I love my car.
