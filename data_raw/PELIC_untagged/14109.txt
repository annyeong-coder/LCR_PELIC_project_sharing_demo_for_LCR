solution dear confused The Love is different from a marriage in many ways. Even it seems like true that one decide to get marry with the partner who love you forever he who want to get marry with someone should take enough time to consider about his partner with his family members. In case of you your parent want you to get marry with Japanesse. Even though you do not understand your parent's the opinion right now I think you must be understand that Love could be changed somtime. Moreover failure of marriage might destroy one's life. Of course you may think that kinds of problems never happen to you. However you have met Jim only for 9 month. I think that 9 month is not enough to know well about a partner. In addition Jim is forigner. I recommend to you that anyway your first goal in U. S. A was study Western Literature not a marriage. So you should tell to your parents that you would give up marriage with Jim. Then you just start your study again. I am not talking about that you should give up Jim for your study. Just say to your parents like this. And you can get a time to know about Jim more. Until you finish study in U. S. A if you would not change your mind I am sure that the time never would not be late to get marry with Jim. I hope that now your lover would be your husband sometime.
