Living in a in the US makes you try a lot of new things. When I first arrived the states I had had a bubbles coffee for the first time in my life. It was delicious. Moreover by the time I registered in the University of Pittsburgh I had experienced finding a place to stay in and I have never tried that before. Also before I learned how to cook for myself I had tried a lot of kinds of food in the restaurants such as the Mexican and the Thia food.
