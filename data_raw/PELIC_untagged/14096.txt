In the last decades hospitals have required good surgeons to provide good surgical operation to the patient. Therefore the situation has changed since medical companies start to make various kinds of surgical tool. Even immature surgeons can perform average operations to patients using these tools. For example we usually use a thread to close the wound by making a knot. Nowadays a medical company invented a special glue to close a wound. Since then we start to use the glue because any surgeons can close the wound easily and fast without practice. On the other hand that means a surgeon can have less chance to use thread. In the future there will be a surgeon who cannot close a wound with a thread. In addition this special glue is extremely expensive. High cost of surgical tools also can cause high cost of medical insurance. I think we should fairly accept the development of surgical tools as that of medicine though surgical operations recently require not a good surgeon with god hands but average surgeons good surgical tools and money.
