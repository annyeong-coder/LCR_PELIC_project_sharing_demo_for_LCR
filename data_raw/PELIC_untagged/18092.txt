My favorite and most important memory I had and never forgot was when I had my seven years old. At this time I didn't know the person who I grew with was not my mother. I was laugh because I though that a joke but after she finished her story I believed that. In addition after one year when I got the living room I saw a lady sitting there I went automatically outside and got my aunt you have someone sitting in the living room she said the person who sitting there is your mother. I ran far away because I didn't know here and my friends who lived across the street told me Did you meet your mother because she was here ten minutes ago. The second time I met her was exciting for me she brough a lot gifts that I never had. At this day she brough me back in my country when I was born. The most important was I met my family bothers and sisters. Living with them helped to learn a new dialect different with I grew up. I hope to do not have the same story with my kids in the future.
