p. 132 Dear Confused It will take long time for you to get acceptance of your marriage on your parents. Your parents are worried about you and want to be close to you. Your parents think interracial marriage is associated with lots of risks. First of all you and Jim should visit to Japan and persuade your parents. You tell them honestly how you love Jim and why you love him. You also look for opportunities for your parents and Jim to get to know each other well. At meeting with your parents and him you discuss your dreams and goal etc. Secondly you teach Japanese to Jim. Learning Japanese is a appreciate way to do to get acceptance. If Jim can have a conversation in Japanese your parents will consider him to be considerate. Finally if your parents disapprove your marriage despite your efforts you have to think about the worst case. You have to ask yourself whether your love for Jim is strong enough to maintain in spite of being off your parent. You have to be sure that you love Jim Jim is the man that you want to spend the rest of your life with. On the other hand if your feel doubt you should postpone your marriage I wish you good luck! P. 133 Dear Advisor I have been in Pittsburgh for about six months and it has been really rough. When I first arrived everything was new and exciting. I really liked the differences between here and home. I was happy to be in a new country. I'm 22 and I wanted to start doing things on my own but it's been much harder than I expected. Now I want to leave my poor apartment and go back to my house with my parents and the place that are familiar and comforting. I struggle to get up in the morning to go to classes. And sometimes I don't want to see or talk to anyone but I don't have a choice because I have to learn English. Sometimes I'm confused about what to do. There are still lots of things I like but now there are more things I dislike. I feel really homesick! What should I do to cope with homesickness Homesick
