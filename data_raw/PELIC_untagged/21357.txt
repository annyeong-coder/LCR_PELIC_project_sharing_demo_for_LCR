My best friend I have many good friends. My best friend who called youngjin likes to play soccer with me. Moreover my best friend has a younger brother whose hobby is to play soccer too. We had gone a high school which we graduated together. He always helps the poor on the street even though he knows that they aren't actually such poor people. His favorite musician is Buzz who was once famous for his voice in my country. We also enjoy traveling some places where we could see the beach and we could talk at night. It was great experience that know more each other.
