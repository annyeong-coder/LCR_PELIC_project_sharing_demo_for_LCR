I was born and raised in Seoul which is the capital of Korea. Seoul is famous for Olympic which we held in 1988. At that time I was 8 years old and I remembered a little that people were eager to hold the Olympic successfully. Seoul also has many historic monuments. About 600 years ago Taejo who is one of the Korean kings had Seoul surrounded by walls in order to defend against an attack and made four gates to enter Seoul which is the South Gate the East Gate the West Gate and the North Gate. In among them the South Gate was designated as the first national treasure. Although walls don't remain till now we can imagine how big the walls are through the four gates remained. I like especially the South Gate whose sculptures and pictures on the ceiling are very beautiful. Sadly the South Gate was burned by an arsonist last year. All people cried and so did I. I cannot forget the shocking accident which a psycho committed until now. Now the South Gate is being restored but I don't think that the value of the South Gate as the first national treasure will be restored.
