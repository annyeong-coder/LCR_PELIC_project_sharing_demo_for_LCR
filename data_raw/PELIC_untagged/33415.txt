I had an interesting experience traveled different country in Asia before I moved to U. S. A. When I finished the first semester and I had traveled to different cities in U. S. A. I had always gone me friends by the time I transfered to another city. It was 2001 My father got high status position in K. S. U I had finished primary school. After My brother had been acting on theater school he was first a good student and got a prize.
