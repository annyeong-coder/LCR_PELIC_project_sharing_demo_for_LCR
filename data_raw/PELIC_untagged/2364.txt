My boy friend's wedding Julian and Michael had been friends each other more than 9 years. Julian got a call from Michael that he would get married 4 days later and he told her that he needed her help for his wedding. When she met Michael and his fiance she had some strange feeling of him. Julian realized that she had been having the feeling of him for a long time ago and she was being jealous at that moment. She tried to mess his weeding up having a piece of advise from her boy friend who had been knowing for a few years. But it didn't work as she wanted. When the wedding day came Julian told Michael that she loved him and then kissed him while his fiance was walking from their side. It seemed to be over completely between Michael and his fiance. However Julian told both of them about the truths and she made them sure that they still love each other. After all they got married and before Michael left their honeymoon he gave her a big hug. She went back to the party place. When she was sitting on the chair she got a call from her boy friend. Julian found that he was in the same place with here. They met and danced together. And then the flim is over
