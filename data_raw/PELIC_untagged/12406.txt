I went to Los Angeles when I was an University student. I went to Los Angeles with my cousins. And I stayed in Los Angeles about 30 days. Frist we visited my aunt and her friends. We stayed in my aunt's home about two weeks. Her home is located in Long Beach. There is a beautiful place. Then we went to Grand Canyon Disneyland Universal Studio and Las Vegas. After that we went to Hong ANON_NAME_0 a few days for shopping. Finally we went home.
