Life at villages have several perspectives but I will talk about two method of thinking . First people who lives in a large city reject to live in a village because they used to do a lot of things in their leisure . Also they will be uneasy about how to keep time in a village because there is not anything to do for entertainment . By the way I am one of them who do not want to live in a village . Second there are a lot of people who want to live in a village after retirement . However people who want to live in a village do not a disturb because they work a lot and they want to complete their life happy . In addition a lot of people like to live carefree from anything so they go to live in a village . Finally life at village could be uneasy to some people and could be comfortable to others people .
