I think it is strange to throw away something that is still in usable condition. If the thing still can use why not continue using it It is a waste to throw away and buy a new one. Some people threw things on curbside and the curbside hunters picked them up. They knew some of those things still can be used why couldn't those people who threw them away didn't know that It's really a waste to throw something still useful.
