I met my best friend while I was transferring from my first high school to the second one. Her seat was ahead of mine and we always told and had fun after the class. She helped me be familiar with the new environment and also made friends with other classmates. She was a studying hard student and she often taught me the exercise I didn't understand. After class we were going to see the movies and going shopping. Half of my high school time was getting along with her. We separated while we were getting into different colleges but we still called to each other frequently. Last summer we were going to Japan together and had a lot of fun.
