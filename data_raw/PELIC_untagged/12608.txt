My room in which I live here has 2 tables. The one is a big round shape with 4 chairs at which I used to eat meals but now I put on lots of paper that is letters newspaper and etc the table. The other table is a small square shape in front of TV at which I've eaten meals as sitting on the carpet. There are 2 calendars which I bought at an outlet mall on a wall. The one that is named fast food has pictures of vehicle which made from vegetable. Those pictures are cute. The other calendar is drawn Stewie who is a character of the Family Guy for which I was looking. Each month he is saying the best phrase which he said in the program and he gives to me one question that something relates to him.
