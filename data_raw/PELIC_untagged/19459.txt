I met my best friend Hui Ni in the high school. One day in the afternoon I walk alone in the school while I was thinking about what I can eat for lunch I saw my classmate Hui Ni. I called her and she was surpreised because we didn't know each other very well. I asked her where she was going She said I want to eat for lunch by the way today is my birthday. I was pleasantly surprised and I said Why don't we have lunch together I want to celebrate for you. She agreed with me and she was very happy. While we were looking for a restaurant on the way I recollected a nice Si Chuan restaurant in the near from school Si Chuan is a province in China the typical food there is very hot then I asked her if she want to go there She said you can read my mind I was thinking about the hot and peppery food then you recommended this Si Chuan restaurant I'd like to go there with you. In the restaurant we talked a lot of things for example we talked about the family from each other and the previou experiences. We felt that we knew each other for a long time already. While we were talking about the intense high school studying we found that it was almost the time for class. We run to the school as fast as we could. That was really a great time!
