I don't think these personality categories perfectly fit me. But I respect the author who classified personality by 4 kinds of types. I suppose that a category which most closely fit my personality is introvert . One of the reasons why I think I am introvert is introvert people prefer to spend time alone rather than hang out friends. For instance when I was young approximately 5 years old I liked to assemble a castle by Lego which was one of the most popular toy products in 1990's. By growing up to be an adult my hobby had changed assembling Lego to reading a book or watching a movie. Also I began to enjoy chatting with my friends. Any way all in all I think I most closely am introvert person.
