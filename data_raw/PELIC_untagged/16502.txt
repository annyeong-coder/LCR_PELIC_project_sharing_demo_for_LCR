I moved from Virginia to Pittsburgh in 18th of December. During the first week I did most important three things first of all. First I bought many things living alone. When I lived in Virginia I didn't have to buy anything living because I have lived with my sister. However after moving I needed many things for the kitchen the bathroom and the bedroom. So I went some shopping malls and bought dishes two pots a mattress a vacuum cleaner and etc. I enjoyed shopping even though not to buy clothes and shoes. Second I cleaned my apartment. After somebody had left the apartment wasn't cleaned. I removed dust on the floor wiped mirror in the bathroom and brushed the sink in the kitchen. Those were not hard and boring work for me. While I lived in my country I would clean my apartment by myself. Third I ordered utilities. I could use water and electricity as soon as moving. But I had to register at each utility's company paying for rate. That was hard work for me because my English was not enough to talk to somebody. When I called an electric company Duquesne to ask what kind of documents I had to send I didn't understand answers and questions obviously. Therefore I visited at the electric company twice to register. Fortunately the leasing office registered for water rate instead of me. In case of internet I ordered by internet in the leasing office. Actually if here had been my county I should have done so easily because I knew the procedure and the documents. Especially language was big problem I have never worried about language while I lived in my country. Those were my first step living in Pittsburgh I have been still walking.
