I had been absent Tuesday so I was totally lost my grammar today. I shoud not have taken a break and should have attended a class. Also I could have asked my class mate what we study today before the class and sould have prepared for the class. I just started to do homework now I kow that I forgot to bring my grammar book. I'm not good at Advisability. I could have brought my book and should have gone over. I don't know that I'm doing well my homework.
