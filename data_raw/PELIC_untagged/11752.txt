I will introduced my favorite Japanese singer. Her name is ANON_NAME_0. She has sung since she was a high school student. She also has made her song since she was a student. I have liked her song since I listened to her voice and music first time. I have listened to her music for 14 years. She was a member of JUDY AND MARY. They organaized one female and three male. She was a singer in the group. They were the most popular band in school girls. And she was always wearing fashionable clothes. She was a fashion leader of girls. Also I used to copy her fashion. However the group disbanded in 2000. I was shocked. I couldn't go to their last concert because I couldn't get the ticket. After that she took a rest for 1 year. And she has sung as solo since 2001. Her voice is very cute and powerful. I always get energy from her voice. She has held a concert every year since 2002. Her concert is very popular so I couldn't get a ticket. But I could go to her concert with my friend one time. I was happy. She also got happy as woman. She has been married since 2002. And she has a boy. She is a mother. I want to become like her. She has gotten prizes every year since 2005. Her video is very interesting. I have already gotton her video. But I forgot in my house in Japan. I sometimes watch it at You tube. I will support her forever.
