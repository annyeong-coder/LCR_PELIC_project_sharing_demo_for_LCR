In some countries teenagers have jobs while they are still students. They usually work to earn money because their adult householder usually can't earn the money as much as their family needs to live. This is not limited to their family's own problems but is related to national economic aspects. Though they should go to school there are the countries whose teenagers have fulltime or part time jobs. For example there are many soccer balls that are made by young children in many developing countries. When soccer ball is made adults can't sew leathers because their hands are too big. So it needs small hands such as children's ones. If you are parents and you have enough income do you want that your child or children have jobs Teenagers or young children should go to school so they learn much more things. After they learn enough they work for their family and country. When they are young and don't learn enough they just work simple jobs so their income may've been low. There are many evidences that income is in proportion with their education.
