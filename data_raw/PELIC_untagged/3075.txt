Maria Candida who was my child mate and who I do not see I long time is living in Palma de Mallorca Spain. We are in touch by the messenger and email which is great because I can have notice of her anytime since she lives so far in another continent. Maria Candida who is from Rivera Uruguay which is my hometown also is a good friend. We both left Rivera that is small town. Her parents that were and still my parents' friends use to live close to each other when we were child. Her parents still living in the same house which still look as the same as a child I remember. When we were child we used to go every Sunday to Lagos del Norte which is a club there has a lake swimming pool etc. Actually there was where my father taught Mirian how to drive. She is Maria Candida's sister who lives in Santana do Livramento Brazil. It is always good to be in touch with who is a real friend.
