One of the most important decisions I have made in my life is coming to the United States to study English. If I hadn't made this decision I would have been working in my country. If I were working in Taiwan I wouldn't have the chance to study at the ELI. If I didn't study at the ELI I wouldn't meet these good teachers and good friends from all over the world. If I didn't meet these good teachers and good friends I wouldn't have leaned so many things. If I hadn't learned so many things I wouldn't have become an independent thinker. If I hadn't become an independent thinker I wouldn't know how to make decisions by myself. Anyway I'm really glad I made this decision to study in the United States. It's the turning point of my life.
