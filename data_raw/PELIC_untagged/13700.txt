The Dark Knight is one of my favorite box office movies played world wide these years. Though most of the people attracted by its astonishing trailers and superhero's icon bought the tickets for an exciting world saving brain needless action movie but this movie spent uncountable painstaking efforts is much more than that. The strong cast included a great amount of famous actors and actress such as Christian Bale Heath Ledger Aaron Eckhart Maggie Gyllenhaal Michael Caine Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman anyone of them can be the leading actor or actress in a big budget Hollywood movie. To talk about the performances these actors paid million dollars did good jobs showing viewers what are good performances but the legendary Joker played by Heath Ledger was performed outstandingly and took away everybody's attraction. Not like the old gentle Joker played by Jack Nicholson this new one was filled with unbelievable madness and unfathomable slyness. To talk about the story it was totally different from the superhero style batman movies. The scenario was based on a logical way in order to show the viewers this story is so true and so is the batman. On the other hand the story contained so much secrecy amazement and sadness everyone who had seen this movie would remain an unforgettable aftertaste of the story and the dark knight.
