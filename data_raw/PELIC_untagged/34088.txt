When I was young I lived in the countryside where there were a number of animals and plants. My father had raised many cows from which we could get milk. I really liked to drink raw milk at that time when I was interested in my height. I remembered the day when I milked cows with my father. It is the most impressive memory in my childhood. Also we usually had a vacation in the mountain where I could breathe in fresh air and go hiking. I enjoyed the moment when I caught fish or swam in the lake with my brothers. My father usually chosen the place for our vacation where there were lots of fish and we could be safe.
