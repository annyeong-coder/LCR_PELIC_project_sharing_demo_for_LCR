My best teacher in Japan is a teacher who is a soccer coach when I was a high school student. He is a very severe teacher. He didn't let student be untidy and didn't get student to be late. Sometimes he hit students who did wrong thing. Actually he became angry and made me run all day long when I skipped a practice of soccer club. But every students liked him and he also liked students. Usually He is stern. But when we had a trouble He was very kind to us. He always helped us to go right way. When he transfer to other school many students and OB gather school and play soccer together.
