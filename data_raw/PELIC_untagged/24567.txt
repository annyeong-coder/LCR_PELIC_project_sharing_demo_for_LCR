In Bryan Walsh's article Eat Less Live Longer Restricting calories extends animal life so doctors want to know if going hungry would help us too he report that researches are trying to determinate if the restriction of calories intake can be reflected on the aging process and even prolong ours lives. He shows that some experiments in animals with diet restrictions result in an extended life and reduce of problems such as cancer diabetes and heart disease. He argues that investigators did not know the biological mechanisms correlated with eat less and live longer and they need to know if the same event occurs in human beings. He assumes that there is a theory about it. The state of slight hunger acts as a mild stressor that makes the organism stronger and more resistant to the ills of aging . He said that another data indicate that humans with low metabolism live longer than humans with fast metabolism. He discusses the results of this discover and the possibility of make new medications which can imitate the calorie restrictions and their benefits. Finally he argue that even tough the volunteers in this research could not live longer they will benefit about losing weight anyway.
