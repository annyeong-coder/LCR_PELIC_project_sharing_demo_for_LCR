Adri is my best friend from Paraguay we shared a lot of activities together. When I met Adri we were studying in college. I remenber that while we were studying nutrition in 2003 we were taking classes to be pilates' instructor. After we finished college we started to work in the same company as pilates instructors. When I decided to come to the USA we were working together for 3 years. I can't forget this day when I told her about my travel she felt very happy but at the same time she was a little sad. Before I came to the USA she planned a surprise party for me while a was working all my friends started to appear. I really miss Adri last time when I called her she was driving to work so I thought that I was living in Paraguay again!
