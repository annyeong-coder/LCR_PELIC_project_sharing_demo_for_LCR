Teachers are very crucial to students because they can enhance students' knowledge and skills. Teachers can also divided into many different kinds according to many aspects. Their styles can have totally different effects. During the time I have spent in schools I have met many teachers some of who are friendly and nice and some of who are strict. If students dislike the teachers' styles they will have bias about the teachers. Li is my math teacher and Wang is my English teacher in my high school. Both of them are responsible teacher hard working and nice. I will compare the two teachers I about their personalities and their ways of teaching. First I want to compare about their personalities. Li is a very strict and well organized teacher while Wang is a funny and emotional teacher. In class Li rarely smile and never talk about something out of math. Sometimes we felt boring at his class. Wang often made jokes while Li often have a strict face. Li is so rigid that he would prepare everything before he do it but Wang likes do everything without schdule and preparation. Second I want to compare about their ways of teaching. Li rarely smile and never talk about something beside math while Wang often made jokes and talk about something besides English. Li liked to give us many homework to practice while Wang liked to give some flexible homework that were very interesting. Li often gave us quizzes to force us keep study while Wang just gave us a few quizzes. At first we all liked Wang but now we know that Li also is a good teacher and we all respect him. So teachers can have many different styles but whatever style the teacher is he should be responsible to students. This is the crucial aspect.
