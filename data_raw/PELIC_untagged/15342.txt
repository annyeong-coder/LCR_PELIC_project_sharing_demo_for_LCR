All the personality type given didn't match me perfectly. I'm a person who have mixed personality sometimes I love to go to parties but sometimes I want to be alone. My best friend who knows me for 13 years said that I'm a person who is very active and love to meet new people. However sometimes she feels that I can stop doing things in the middle of any situation easily because I feel like I want to be alone. I think what she thought is really funny because I never notice myself. I know one thing that I like is people who are friendly sincere and like me the way I am.
