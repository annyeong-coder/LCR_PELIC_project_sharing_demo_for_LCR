Inception one of which I like is a successful movie. I watched it at Waterfront where I go usually to watch movies. I went with two friend who are ELI students. I watched in August when the movie was number one in the box office. Inception starring Leonardo DiCaprio is probably one of the best his movies. It directed by Christopher Nolan. The story is about a skilled thief whose name is Dom Cobb. Dom Cobb the best in the dangerous art of extraction is stealing valuable secrets within the subconscious during the dream state when the mind is at its most vulnerable. I recommend this movie for people who haven't watched yet.
