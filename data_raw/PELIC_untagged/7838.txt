Hi I am ANON_NAME_0 Last Name . People used to call me Naty. I have written this page to introduce myself. I am 21 years old and I am not married. I grew up in Cadca Slovakia and my family is not big. I have one sister. I have just finished my high school in Slovakia. It was bilingual school where I studied everything in English. Now I am in the United States. I have been studying English for seven years. Since I have moved here I have learned how to take care about myself. Of course I have a social life too. In fact last year I have met a fantastic boy in Slovakia. What about my hobbies and interests I used to play tennis but now I do not have much time to play. I like reading books shopping cooking and I love dogs.
