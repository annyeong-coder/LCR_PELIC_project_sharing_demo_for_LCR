I feel happy when I spend time with my two friends ANON_NAME_0 and Kohji because they make me relaxed and I feel fun. ANON_NAME_0 is my boyfriend. We met in Paraguay when I was nine year old. Now I live with ANON_NAME_0 and another friend. ANON_NAME_0 is studying Film at Point Park University now and he will graduate this summer. ANON_NAME_0 has a good film partner Kohji. He is studying Film with ANON_NAME_0. ANON_NAME_0 is a good cameraman and Kohji is a good director. I usually meet Kohji every weekend because Kohji always come to my apartment to meet ANON_NAME_0 and to eat dinner. Last weekend Kohji came to my apartment to shoot his assignment. So while I was cooking dinner for them they were talking about shooting how to shoot the shot which light is better for each scene the image of Kohji etc. After eating dinner we prepared some stuff for shooting and started making film. I like to eat dinner with them because they always tell me an interesting story. When I am hearing their story I feel happy and relaxed. They are really kind to me. So when I am depressed they always cheer me up. Kohji and ANON_NAME_0 are my awesome friends and I want to be good friend with them for now on.
