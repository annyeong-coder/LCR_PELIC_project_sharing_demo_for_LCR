Since my city is the second religious city in Islam it receives millions of tourists every year. Religious tourism is a stable source for our economic. The Mosque of the prophet ANON_NAME_0 is located in my city which is considered to be a crucial location for Muslims. The government of Saudi Arabia has made many reforms in the mosque and the area around it to adapt the huge numbers of tourists which are increasing regularly every year. Some local people have an aversion to these reforms. Because they said there are many invaluable sites have been removed in order to built new hotels for tourists. In conclusion although the tourist has many benefits for my city it also has disadvantages.
