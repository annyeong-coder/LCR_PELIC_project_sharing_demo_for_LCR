Ten years ago I was driving to my university when a young girl that was talking on her cell phone walked in front of my car and despite that I was not driving fast I couldn't avoid hit her by my car. I called the ambulance immediately and waited for the police. They were very fast but I felt that the seconds move very slowly and my heart was running very fast. After that we went to the hospital and I had to wait for 2 hours while she receive medical attention. Fortunately she didn't have any serious injury and she left the hospital the same day. At this moment I was with my mother she hugged me very strongly and I started to cry for many hours and felt very bad about what would have happened with that girl.
