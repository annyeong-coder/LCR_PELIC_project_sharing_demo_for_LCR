The worst meal experience I have ever had happened about 6 months ago. I had just came to the United States. I was scared and excited of everything new. I wanted to see a lot of things in the first day. My uncle invited his friends from Slovakia living here and his colleques from hotel where he works to have a dinner. It was beautiful warm day. We went to restaurant. I was trying to speak English but sometimes it was funny that everybody was laughing. The trouble started right after we were waiting for food. They asked me if I like sea food. I said I have never eaten better food than sea food. I thought it will be good but actually I had never eaten sea food until that time. The waiter brought a lot of food and of course everything was from the sea crab soup octopuses shrimps and other. When I saw it on the table I started to be sick. There was anything to do I started to eat. After eating first piece of food I didn't know how to look at people. Everybody started to laugh again. I felt so silly but after while I was laughing too. This is my worst meal experience because I was trying to pretent something. It is unbelievable for many people but I hate sea food more from that time
