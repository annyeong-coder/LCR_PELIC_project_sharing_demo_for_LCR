Summary In the lecture the lecturer refers to three major terms of social psychology. There are Conformity Compliance and Obedience. In conformity he introduces a experiment about some people in a line everybody is told this is a experiment and need to say the wrong answer. Just only one person doesn't know that. The result is 37 of the people will follow the wrong answer under pressure even his answer is right. And 10 of people when them hear somebody say the correct answer like theirs they still go along with wrong answer. Compliance is a higher level to change others behavior with a direct request. There is a technique called door technique when you want to request somebody agree your request you should ask the small tiny request first and your second larger request will be accepted after. For example Majority of students agree to take kids to the zoo four hours a week rather to work six to eight hours per week in next fifteen weeks. But the premise that working six to eight hours need to be asked first. In obedience people will follow the request just because the authority offers the request. For example the order request the tester push the button to chock another tester in heavy volts of electricity when the tester answer wrong.
