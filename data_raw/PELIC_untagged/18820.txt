The most important thing I learned this semester is how to handle the disadvantages of living in a foreign country alone for a long time. I have been abroad many times before however these trips were for 2 3 weeks that means for vocation. The mental of going abroad as a trip is distinct than going for a long term education. Only the people who have an experience about it know this feeling its benefit and detriments. I have lived alone for 4 years in Istanbul thus living alone is not a new thing for me. However this is different because Turkey is my homeland and everybody speaks the same language Turkish. And my family relatives and friends live there. Here in America I use my second language English which is my target of being here to communicate people. I take full day classes I attend the beautiful activities which ELI offers I met nice friends here. Even if I learned how to handle loneliness in a foreign country I know that the isoation will be never end.
