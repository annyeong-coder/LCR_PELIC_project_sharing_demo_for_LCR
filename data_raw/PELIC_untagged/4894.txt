The Historical event in my country was when the president Hugo Chavez won the elections. Chavez tried a lot of stuff that have changed our politics economy and social behavior. Although Chavez has increased the poverty and it seems is getting worse. Even though for family that already was poor now they gone poorer. For example Some families that were middle class became in poor class. Furthermore with Chavez the politics problems are worse each day because Chavez and his politics person are corrupt and they only want to be rich and powerful. Nowadays social behavior is a huge problem in Venezuela because population have a sheer frustration about how they can resolve their problems about health education nutrition security social life etc. In other hand Chavez does not do anything for improve security in Venezuela the people do not have security and when they go out to their jobs or they go out for some fun they are afraid about their lives due to many thieves and killers are on the street. Finally there is not justice and for Chavez this seemed not to have much importance. The Venezuelan people hope that this situation is be getting better in the future and many of us just want that Chavez leaves the government and the country. He changed the history of our country but he made that our country is worse even our economy politic and social life.
