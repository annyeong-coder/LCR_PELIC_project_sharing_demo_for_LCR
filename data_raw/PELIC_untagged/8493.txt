I love my apartment and it is a good place for me to have good rest. So I put a lot of effort to decorate my apartment. My apartment is very huge so I hang up a lot of pictures on the wall and also put up beautiful curtans in front of the window. Becasue I want to make my apartment look more vivid. Living in huge apartment is also necessary to straighten it up everyday. For example I need to throw the trash out wash dishes and light candles up. The most importamt thing is the winter coming I need to turn on the heater or I will catch a cold due to the extreme coldness. Even though I have to do so many things for my apartment I still enjoy living here especially on the weekend because I have enough space to set up all tables for party.
