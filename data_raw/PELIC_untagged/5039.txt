Smells play a part in how people choose their mates. The smells play a very important role at how the people find their soul mate because each person looks the different kind of smells and ovoid the same odors and this is the way how persons find the perfect made. It has a lot of influences in their immuno types and their inheritance. Do you find this idea to be reasonable I think this is very difficult to answer because each person has special characteristics one of them can be the odor. It's obviously everyone has a different kind of smell that you can't describe but you can't say this is how the people find their soul made. I think when you look your soul made you need more than the smell you try to find someone who enjoy with your company who wants to share the life with you and this imply more things than the smell.
