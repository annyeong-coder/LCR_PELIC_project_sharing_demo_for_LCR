Movies have been contributed to transfer many cultural from nation to other nation. However it is obvious nowadays how the moves illustrate the other culture. For instance before I came here to United States I had that chance to draw a good image about the American people and their culture via watching moves. If the movie doesn t point out this picture that would be inconvenience to me. So we can see clearly that movies help people civilizations to move from country to other country and to be more acceptable.
