Intendation Once 2 years ago I had a horrendous accident when I was driving a car that a friend had rented on that day. I woke up that morning with heart in mouth after a frightening nightmare in which I was a pilot of a ship that was sinking. I dragged myself out of bed after some time and gulped up my breakfast feeling the early morning getting ready for the day. After breakfast I was waiting my friend to go shopping as we planned before. When he picked me up he looked awful the early morning stupefaction. He wanted me to drive the car because he felt he couldn't focus on the road. When I drove the highway I am speeding crazily at first then I realize that so I slow down. The road is crowded and I am going 120 Km h which is the speed limit in there suddenly the hood of the car flies up into the windshield making my heart jump out of my mouth. In that moment I can't see anything and small fragments of the windshield everywhere. It is like it hits my head. I magically controlled it. I tried to pull out on the side without hitting anything. I stopped and checked the car it was damaged badly. However the weather was sweltering so I preferred to continue my way than waiting hours for help. The car was like diving and I could hardly over the windshield. It was an accident that is imprinted on my memory.
