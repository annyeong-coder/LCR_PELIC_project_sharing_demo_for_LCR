This reading is evidently about the ghosts in the American folklore. A prospector and his dogs lost and affected in the muskeg country of Yukon for more than 24 hours find a solid ground where they rest a few hours and some mysterious events start. The first event was a dream in which prospector fights against a warrior because the prospector had invaded his sacred territory. The second was a feminine apparition who shows him the way to home.
