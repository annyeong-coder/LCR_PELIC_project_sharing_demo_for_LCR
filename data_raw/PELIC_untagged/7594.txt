Dramatic Life Change If what you are speaking cannot be understood at all by people around you if you cannot know at all what people are saying and if you cannot find those familiar TV programs at all that you get used to watching in your life after dinner for more than a couple of decades on the TV channels How do you get through this situation and survive it Several months ago I started to experience this situation because I just moved here United States from China. Obviously moving to US has changed my life fundamentally. Nearly all daily encountering are new to me but the most remarkable are diet change cooking at home every day instead of at least having one meal at a decent restaurant language change learning to speak English instead of speaking Chinese and media diversity change watching CNN ABC instead of those channels that are forced to broadcast the same program. Before I arrived here I was extremely occupied by my daily workings. Sometimes I need to stay in the office for fifteen continuous hours. Frequently I ordered take out. Or if I can squeeze out one or two hours I prefer to have my dinner at my favorite restaurant which would provide dishes with my hometown style. At that time I never considered food from other countries because I deeply loved my hometown's food and hardly diverted my attention to other styles. Now I have tried several Chinese restaurants here none of which can satisfy me at all. Since it's impossible to get the satisfied authentic Chinese cuisine I decided to make them by myself. Actually this is a big challenge for me because I seldom did that in China. But I'm between jobs so I can spend a lot of time on researching cooking. Until now I have found that I have the potentials to become a great chef great interest in cooking and excellent common sense about cooking. Also the feedback from my Chinese friends who ever tried my dishes is that if I open a traditional Chinese restaurant here I will make a killing over it. More important cooking is so fascinating to me. By take different approaches to the same raw materials and different combination of them I can make completely different flavor dishes. Moreover I gradually realize that cooking by myself will definitely make me stay much healthier than before because I learn much knowledge on how to take advantage of the principles of traditional Chinese medicine to make daily diet function as a cure for those diseases in an early time that could not be detected by western medicine. Another big change for me is to learn to speak English. In those days in China I was not required very often to keep in contact with foreigners. So speaking English was not what I should focus on. Chinese seemed enough for me to earn a living. When I came here I suddenly found that my English was a big problem that could not be cracked easily and much more serious than what I imaged if I wanted to get into a top business school to finish MBA program. I was shocked by my idea that if I was exposed to foreign language environment enough I could speak English fluently. That's too na nmarning English. Now I want to say there is no such kind of point it is a lifetime study. In this change process my big harvest is that I figure out my common problems when speaking English and Chinese. These problems are not exclusively related to speaking English but also shared by speaking Chinese. And so I can take the right approach to get over them and save a lot of time. Finally the available media resources here are much more diverse than in China. TV programs I can watch in US are completely different from what I did before. In the golden time period from 7 pm to 8 pm each day in China nearly all TV channels are required to broadcast the same news program that is China Central TV news. This requirement has been effective for half one century. But there is no such kind of requirement for a TV program across the US. What I have seen here is that every cable TV channel has the right to decide what news will be on the air or not. In this way I here more possibly have the opportunity to access different reports on the same news from different aspects and they will have a better position to see what's truly happening. Actually TV programs in some extent I think have reflected the difference between uniformness in Chinese culture and diversity in American culture. What makes me surprised is that I can find the influence of 'uniformness' in most of daily behavior and thoughts. In a word as for me life in China and life in US vary mostly in terms of the way to get meals the language in communication and the number of available media sources. These changes are going to definitely have a great influence on my future life helping me stay healthy making me communicate with others effectively in the global and recognizing the importance of diversity. On one hand I will never forget my rootedness in China. On the other hand I feel very happy to experience these change in my life.
