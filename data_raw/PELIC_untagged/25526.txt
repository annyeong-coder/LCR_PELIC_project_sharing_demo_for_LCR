I like to eat Naengmyeon that is kind of cold nodles. I think that need an egg and piece of meats which usually is beef noodles piece of ices and piece of cucumbers. Specially I used to eat Naengmyon in the summer or after drink too much. Also special beef soup stock make it more delicous. Also piece of pear is in this noodles so it is more refreshing. Sometimes people vinegar into it because vinegar make it taste more than more.
