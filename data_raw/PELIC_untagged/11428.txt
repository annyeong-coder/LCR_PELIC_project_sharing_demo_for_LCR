Chon Yei elementary school where I studied for six year was an important place for me. I have a lot of memory at this school and I met several great teachers there. I remember the first day when I went to the school I was nervous. Mrs. Lou whom I liked very much encouraged me to be brave. She was also my first homeroom teacher and she taught me a lot of basic knowledge in my first two years at the school. Mrs. ANON_NAME_0 whose son was my classmate in junior high school was my art teacher. She taught me many skills of painting. She was very kind to every student and every student loved her class. But I need to say sorry for her because I still can't make a good picture now. Mr. Wang who many students liked his humor was my math teacher. He made mathematic become interesting in class. It is very important for students learning. In addition there were some teacher that I have forgot their name were also pretty good. Because of them I felt my life of elementary school was full of variety. I really appreciated their offer for student at Chon Yei elementary school. I was very glad that I could go to this school.
