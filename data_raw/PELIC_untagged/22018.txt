New Years in Valparaiso is the most beautiful show on the sea in South America. Every New Years all the Porte om prepares dessert every year but we never have time and always forget to eat. I can't forget to mention our traditional liquor for the holiday. Its name is Cola de mono. It's delicious and sweet. Its ingredients are milk coffee cinnamon cloves and agua ardiente A south American liquor that's like white brandy but stronger . After deciding which will be your dinner every family starts to organize the house for the party. Everybody puts ornaments about the New Year and summer on their walls. I think that the most important part of New Year's Eve is the music you choose for that moment. The idea is to mix a new song with old traditional music. Every Chilean knows which songs everybody wants to listen to that night for example Tommy Rey and their band. Hampagne and everybody toasts for the next year.
