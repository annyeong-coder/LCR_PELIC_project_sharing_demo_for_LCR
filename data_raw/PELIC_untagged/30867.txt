This a short story by Mark Twain is about the bad little boy named Jim who never get caught in trouble or have his bad actions come back to him in the end . He also gets the fairytale ending for his life. He tells the story of a young boy who acts like the bad boys who are in the Sunday school books. All the sins he committed are never found out. Everything about this boy turned out differently from the way it does to the bad Jamcses in the book. First once jim stole the key of the pantry and slipped in there helped himself to some jam. He ate that jam and said it was bully in his sinful vulgar way and he put it in the tar when the old woman found it out he denied knowing anything not as the story in the Sunday school book. Although once he went in farmer acorn's property to steal apples. He didn't fall down his limb and his arm didn't break or get torn by the farmer's great dog like bad boys in the Sunday school books. Another example of the bad little boy's evil action came and slipped it onto other boy when he stole the teacher's penknife and slipped it onto good boy in village George Wilson to get him in trouble. The bad little boy didn't fess up to being punished by the teacher who brought the switch down upon his trembling shoulders. Moreover unlike other bad little boys drown or get struck by lightning when he went fishing and boating. Also the elephant did not knock the top of his head off with his trunk when he gave the elephant in the menagerie a plug of the tobacco. Not surprisingly that the bad little boy did not follow the rules of the Sabbath by which he was supposed to abide. Consistently throughout the story the bad little boy is described as being unique from other bad little boys he bore
