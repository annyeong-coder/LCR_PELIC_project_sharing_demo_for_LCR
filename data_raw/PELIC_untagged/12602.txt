Today I would like to share with you my experience that I had during my vacation. On July 1 2006 I traveled to Spain for vacation with my girlfriend for the first time in my live. I spent there one week. First of all I was not able to speak Spanish so I tried to speak in French. The Spanish people were friendly with tourist. One of the amazing activities that I liked was the beach it was a lot of fun. Then I visited different museum and monuments of several civilizations. The weather was so nice during the hall trip. It was sunny warm and little bit humid. There are too many restaurant of different kind of food the food was so delicious and my favorite dish was Paella. My favorite part of the trip is the shopping I think every one likes shopping I found many good dills.
