The winter is coming so it is a good time to wear worm clothes. This season will be my first time living on a place with could winter. I was interested in learning how to make a scarf appropriate to wear during a cooler time. If you are interested in making a knitted scarf you should follow the basics steps Begin by making some decisions. First of all you need to choose what kind of yard you will prefer to use in your creation. For example wool cotton or polyester are some options. I prefer cotton yards because I am allergic to wool. Sometimes I knit clothes with mixed compositions like 50 cotton and 50 polyester. Usually this kind of yard is wormer. After that you can choose the needles. When you have chosen your style you are now ready to begin making your first knitted scarf. Get two yards bowl with 20 meters each and start doing small knots around the needles. You will need to do almost 25 knots for a good size scarf. Try to seat in a confortable position. Remember than you are using just your hands to make it so relax and enjoy the hand made work line by line. At this point you are almost done. You stil need to continue doing the same process to make new lines. Usually I spend one week to have my scarf done working 1 hour each day to finish this process. I love knitting because makes me feeling relax . As you can see it is really not difficult to make a knitted scarf. It is a wonderful opportunity to explore your creativity relax your mind and to increase your closet with new clothes.
