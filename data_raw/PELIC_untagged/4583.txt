Most important quality for a Judge A judge must study hard about law and precedents. The most important quality for a judge is the right philosophy. Because there is no jury system in Korea the power of a judge is stronger than that of the US. For a judge following laws and leading cases is easy and it is very passive and conservative attitude. A good judge should advocate protecting victims from criminals through judgments. For example only a couple of decades ago in Korea hitting a wife wasn't considered a crime and people thought that the wife might have deserved to be hit. And the judge ruled that the husband was not guilty because there could have been appropriate reason for violence and recommended the family quarrel should have been solved in house by themselves. But if the judge had the right philosophy that the violence everywhere should be prohibited and judged that the husband was guilty violence in a house should have been decreased more rapidly. The judge should struggle to carry on developed judgments.
