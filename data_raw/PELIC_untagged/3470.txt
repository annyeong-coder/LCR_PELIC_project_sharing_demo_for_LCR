These technologies can help students to choice their best option. Learning with computers and TV might help many students. For example some students who don't want to a fixed time table may want to their classes late night or early in the morning. Specifically they can record all the classes and can watch whenever they want. Also they can repeat their classes that they couldn't understand first time as much as they want to and they also get more time to develop their extra activities such as exercising their body learning new language or traveling to other country. Because their classes are so flexible they might have more time than now. Besides these technologies are very helpful to handicapped students. These students had to go the real school to study. But in the future with all these technologies they can study in their room. However there is something students should remember. These technologies are based on self control. If they can't control their technologies they will lose their most important time in their life. It is totally up to you. You ought to control your study schedule. Most students in teen ages don't have self control. They are not mature enough to control themselves. So the parents and students should help each other to get more effects from these technologies.
