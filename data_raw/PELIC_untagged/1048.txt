Piggy has been a senior high school mathematics teacher for one year. She has had experiences in teaching math since 2001. She has been a Chinese chess instructor in senior high school for six months. She also has been a basketball trainer in senior high school for six months. Because she is a new teacher in her school so she must to do many things that other teachers don't want to do. However it has been 14 years since she started playing basketball. I think she can teach students how to play basketball well.
