Over the back ten years in the US history the governments have started 3 major wars and many small missions. Although they were under the name of freedom they had costed thousands deaths among both civilians victims and american troops not including the enemy deaths. Destroying the lives of millions to serve their interests the US governments act against the principles that American society is based on. Justice and such principles will look meaningless when you see and analyze what the US governments did over the years for foreign countries and still there is no freedom. Wars are not a journey or an adventure that someone easily can starts and enjoys. However sometimes its look even like business trip out side the states while wars break down every bit of societies. Using the money of taxpayers many of whom are against wars and throwing troops into wars that not their wars the US governments repeat the same mistakes again and again.
