English Grammar which is not my strong suit gave me a hard time when I was in high school. In retrospect I wished I had studied harder. Since I studied in the ELI class progress has been made in all aspects. Even though I still have a lot to work on I have learned the proper method to study English. It is crucial that I cherish every chance to practice English every day.
