Would you like to live in Gaviotas Why or why not EXPLAIN I wouldn't like to live in Gaviotas because there are lots of mosquitoes. Even I do like the nature environment I hate mosquitoes more than I like. But I like the concept of the community it's all about self ethic. Do you think Gaviotas could be successful on a larger scale Why or why not Explain the difficulties a community like this might have if it grew to be bigger. It's possible to be successful they have a rich environment and self control. After Gaviotas is explored and educate them it will be successful on a larger scale. If the community grew to be bigger it divides into different groups which have common people. And these common people have the same bad thoughts for this community. They don't care the community accept them or not because they already had their own community.
