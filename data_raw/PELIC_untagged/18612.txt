When I was ANON_NAME_0 I did several mistakes which caused negative consequences. I wash I could change many things I had did. I should have study more English. I could have gone to much better university. I ought not to have worked in this job. I could have asked my parents for advices to choose my major. I might have thought deeply before I chose my major. I should not have done choices with out asked for help. But we can not turn the time back.
