From my own experience three methods could be practical to get us spend less and save more. The first important reminder is to avoid paying by credit cards. They potentially encourage us to spend more if we are not good at controlling our purchase desire because we are free of restraints brought by cash and debit cards and we are just limited by the credit line. Furthermore we don't need to pay off the amount immediately that credit card companies pay sellers for us which probably make us step further into a debt mire. Then we could probably save up to 30 on food expense if we have a membership card for a wholesale store such as Costco. In addition We could go to shopping malls regularly where we could easily come across some postseason deals with pretty good quality but even only 10 percent of the original price. In conclusion we could save much money if we would like to do what I describe above.
