The five things that I would take with me If I am going to live alone on a deserted island are First of all I think I will take a lot of matches to ignite the fire where I can use this fire for most things such as cooking and heating. The second item is I will take at least two compasses just in case if I can not identify the right way. Also I will bring with me a great deal of fishing equipment to fishing may not be available to me adequate food. I think I should take many of cooking pots to cook food and may use them to heat water too. The last thing is I will take at least fifty letters of fresh water we may not find any fresh water in the island. I know they are not enough to live in a deserted island but if they forced me to choose five items I think I need those five things to survive.
