Summary of lost There was a prospector and his dogs searching for gold. One day when the sun rays was nearly disappeared the prospector and his dogs fell in quagmire it was very dangerous accident and they tried to get out for hours until finally they found a hill . At that time the prospector slept because he was tired. While he was sleeping he saw warrior who told him that he should leave this area because he works as protector for this area. The prospector informed the warrior that he will leave if he know the way. In the morning when the prospector opened his eyes he found a beautiful lady who suddenly changed to a brilliant rabbet and started hopping in front of him and show him the way. Finally the prospector reached the solid area that he knew very well and the rabbet returned back to a more beautiful women and she disappeared once the sun rays raised up. Sorry!
