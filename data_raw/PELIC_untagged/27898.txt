To be honest I'm not a person easy be shocked by something. Before I came to U. S. I have known that boys' and girls' resident halls were not separated here they can live in a same building. I was little surprised by this fact. However it's not that bad that there is a whole girls resident building on campus. Or at least I can still live with girls in a same room in a mix building. I'm glad that I moved into the whole girls building but what shocked me was that my RA one day told me that boys can visit this building and they even can stay as over night guests with a girl's permission. In my hometown China this can never happened. The reality is girls and boys live separately no way for them to enter each others' dorms no matter whether they have a resident's permission or not. Unless an officer allows them to enter with official business. I think this can be count as a kind of culture shock right
