Yesterday I was looking for a auto repair center because I felt like my car has a problem. So I called Pep boys center and asked them to have look on my car to figure out the problem. But the guy told me to hold on to check there ability to do that. But because I waited for more then 10 minutes I hanged up the phone. They called back and ask me to drop my car there and pic it up at Monday. I said that will be very good and I left the car there to fix it.
