4Months ago I met Jojo. We didn't know each other because her country differences with me. One day my roommate introduced me to Jojo. That day we had ELI activity so I enjoyed ELI activity. While we were enjoying ELI activity we were more closely each other. After one day we talked a lot of times. When we were talking she sent to me the comedy videos. We played game together. We became a good friend. While we were becoming a friend I changed my mind to her. I felt I like her. Later we became a couple. I can't forget that time. I know Jojo is important person for me while we love each other. Now we are making love. I always think I thank her because she always helps to me. I want to love her forever.
