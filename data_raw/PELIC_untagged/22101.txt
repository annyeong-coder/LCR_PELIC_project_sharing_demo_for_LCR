Yes I consider language a difference between nonhuman and human. I believe that even early humans can communicate in a simple way using language or rudimentary language but nonhuman can not use language in the same way that we use even in millions years ago. Humans use the language in a complex way with words sounds and graphics signs . Even the earliest human can use hieroglyphs to communicate. Nonhuman uses a kind of communication very simple with rudimentary sounds and body language but they can not develop a much complex language like us.
