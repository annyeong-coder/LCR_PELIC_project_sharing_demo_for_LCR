My favorite place in my house is my kitchen. When I enter my kitchen I can see a big oven on the back wall. A refrigerator is next to oven on the right. A dishwasher is next to a big oven on the left. A top cook is top of a big oven. A small oven is next to top cook on the right. Two shelf is over a big oven and a dishwasher. The many flavorings are top of shelfs. The recipes are behind flavorings. I like this place.
