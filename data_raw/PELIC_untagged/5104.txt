Since I went to school I have learned how to make teddy bears. Once in a while I made teddy bears. I had few teddy bears at home It was very fun. When I lived in korea I've been making earrings for a long time. Sometime I gave it to my friends since last year. Some people wanted to buy my earrings. That was make me happy.
