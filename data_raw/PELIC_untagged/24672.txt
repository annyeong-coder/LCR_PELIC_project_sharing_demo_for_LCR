If I am going to be on a reality TV show on the island for five weeks I have got to take matches. With matches I can start a fire and with a fire I could cook and warm food. I must take a toothbrush so that I am abe to clean my teeth. In addition I should take a solar powered computer which I can use to communicate with my friends sending and receiving e mails .
