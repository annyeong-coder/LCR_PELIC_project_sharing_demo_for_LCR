I like my room and it is important to me that it is clean. I straighten up every day. If there is any trash I throw it out and I always put my clothes away. Another thing that I like about my room is that I hung up a Chilean flag. I can turn on and off as well as turn up and down my light because I have a modern system. Also when I want to watch TV I only need to sit down on my bed. Also my room has a good size If I would like I could turn the bed around and I would not have a problem. On my wall I have a blackboard for when I want to write down all my ideas. One more reason why I like my room is because it's like my room in Chile where I grew up.
