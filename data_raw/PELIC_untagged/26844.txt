Now I want to talk something about myself before I came to the ELI. When I was young I used to play with my dolls. Now I was a adult I didn't play with my dolls. Actually in China I used to speak chinese everyday today I was used to speak English. This was my first time to came to pittsburgh. My lifestyle it was totally different between U. S with China. In pittsburgh I was used to take a bus to go to school. In my hometown I like to drive to go anywhere. To be honesty during this time it was my best life .
