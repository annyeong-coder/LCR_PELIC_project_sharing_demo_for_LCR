One day a prospector was searching for gold with his two dogs. Then he was lost in the muskeg. He was so tired that he couldn't find the right way. He had to find place to sleep. As the prospector slept he dreamt that a fierce warrior was threatening him. The prospector asked that he might to allow going home. When he woke up he saw a glowing woman. She suddenly turned into a beautiful snow white rabbit. The glowing rabbit hopped slowly ahead of the prospector leading him eastward. Just before dawn they reached solid ground. The white rabbit became once more the beautiful woman. Then she vanished as the first rays of the sun pierced the horizon.
