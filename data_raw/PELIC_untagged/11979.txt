Relationships are an essential aspect in my life. Usually when I write about this topic I remember my first friends especially the time when I met my first girlfriend when I was living in Ecuador. It happened while she was studying in the University. She was very smart and she never had demonstrated any interest in me. But one day while she and I were taking a test she felt very sick. Then I took her and drove to the hospital called her family and stayed with her until her mother came for her. Obviously she and her family were very grateful for my attitude. So approximately two or three days later she called me at the night when I was watching TV in my home and she invited me to eat dinner in her house. Since that night we began to meet frequently spending time knowing and loving each other more.
