If we are in Desert island we should take matches. Because we can eat cooked meat or fish and keep warm during night by fire. Also we have to bring knife for cutting hard things like coconuts or trees. As well we can take toothbrush if there are many ones. If you bring only yours someone may use yours when you sleep! But we don't have to take a book. It must be burden your shoulder. Or we can bring a solar powered computer. If there is good whether we must use instead of flashlight book pen and paper. If I'll able to bring anything what I want regardless of cost and possibility I'll bring Giant eagle!
