I was successful in a case when I worked for Royal Commission R. C for Jubail Industrial City. I worked in legal affairs department. One day my boss gave me a case about a man who was detinue of land that the R. C usurped. In addition he enclosed a title deed with a specific date. So he desired the cost of rental for all years that R. C usurped his land. I studied the case and started collecting official documents for the R. C title deed and all the governmental decrees. Finally I found an official decree issued from the King ANON_NAME_0 third king of Saudi Arabia that defined the borders of R. C and the date of this decree predated his title deed. Because of that he lost his case. After that this case became as reference for all similar cases.
