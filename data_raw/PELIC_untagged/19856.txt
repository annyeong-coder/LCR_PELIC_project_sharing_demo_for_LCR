There are a lot of food types all countries have special food different others. Last year I came to Pittsburg. The most considerable thing which I was thinking about was the difference food between my country and Pittsburgh. After I had experience and information about Pittsburgh's food it was only after I compared the price flavor and cuisine of the two cities I preferred my country's food.
