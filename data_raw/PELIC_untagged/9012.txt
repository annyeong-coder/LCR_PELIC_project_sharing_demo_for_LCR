I agree with the opinions expressed in the text for two reasons First the decisions that support corpoprate responsablity generaly are in the short term financial negative impact whereas corporations are created to make money. They will avoid all decision that reduce their profit. Second eventhough some corporations are taking steps for corporate responsibility these changes are slow and vulnerable to backsliding . It is necessary to make these changes faster and durable by enacting laws. To make corporation behave kindly it is important to enact as it is stated in the text the Model Code for Corporate Citizenship
