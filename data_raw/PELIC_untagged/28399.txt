I remember all the details of my childhood bedroom. It was a big room for a little girl and all my friends who had smaller room were amazed by the size of mine. My bed which was a queen bed was to the right of the front door. Opposite in the right angle there was television which I used to watch my cartoons. My closet which was the former closet of my parents were in the middle of the wall opposite to the door and to my bed. My parents had decided to put a small desk in the corner left of my room when I began to go to the primary school. The window whose curtains were pink were in the middle of the left wall. I liked looking through this window where from I could see the park in which I played with my friends. Behind my door there was a board on which I liked drawing. It was a very beautiful room. Consequently I was a little bit sad when my parents decided to move.
