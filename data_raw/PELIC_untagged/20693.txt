Yolanda did not disappoint her mother. She became a successful poet as her mother expected her. Since youth she has had the talent to inevitably be a famous poet. She was admired by all those absorbed and captivated people as she used to read poetry to anyone she met. This made her mother be proud of her. From personal point of view her mother who did not believe in sex for girls did not realize her daughter's passionate emotions and ascribed them to her wide imagination and feelings.
