What is Flow Flow in the sense expressed in the text The Creative Spirit is a state of total immersion inside a topic or a creation. When flow is reached it means that the mind is engrossed around one topic the time sensation disappears and the potential to produce something original is the higher point. The last time that I experienced a flow state was when I was writing the comparison contrast essay for my writing class. The circumstances around this state were total concentration around my subject cero interruptions and a profound reading to the supporting material that I was dealing with. It was at this time when I could write more extensively. Individual learners should propitiate this state submerging in a state of total concentration. To achieve that they must be able to leave behind all worldly preoccupations and set their mind ready to encourage a new creation. Schools might promote flow allowing to students to choose their most interesting topics and persuading them to create new knowledge from these ideas.
