Creativity is something we all naturally have people inside. In this reading we saw the case of a person named Teresa who was restricted to develop her creativity as it was drawn. Teresa was sent to a school where she had to follow certain rules with restrictions on what could and could not do all day. This shows that creativity can be killed by various ways such as competition to which children are subjected on controlled in what they do freedom to choose who they want to do among others. But one of the creatives commonly killed is the time that children should realize their actvidades are controlled at what time should start finish. Finally children should be left to do the activities that I prefer as long as they want so get them to develop their creativity correctly.
