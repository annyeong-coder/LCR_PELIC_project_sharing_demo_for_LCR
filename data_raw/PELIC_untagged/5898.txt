Before I came here I had left my job after I receiving the flight ticket. By that time I had already gotten the visa. Before I left my job I had worked under pressure because at that time I was undecided about coming here or keeping my job. I tried to deal with that situation by asking my friends and they gave me their advice that helped me make this decision. Also before I left my job I explained that to my manager and he understood and he supported me. I had made a big decision in my life before I came here and I remembered it every moment.
