When I came to America I was 53 kg. I started to gain weight after coming America . Now I am 59 kg and this situation is bother me. Sometimes I have gone to the shopping center to buy some clothes. I have chosen some of them that are so nice but when I wear them I feel unhappy because they are not suitable for me. They are suitable for thin people. On the other hand I like fast food and I do not give up eating fast food. Every week I have decided to start diet so my diet is never start. Nowadays I think how can I solve my weight problem Actually I know what can I do The most important thing is that I have to know one's mind to start my diet and never give up. Secondly I should eat a well balance diet such as I should eat cheese egg tomato pepper and one slide bread at breakfast. I should eat two or three fruit which can be apple pear or banana but I should eat that everyday for my healthy. After I should eat vegetable or meat or chicken at lunch and at dinner. I usually prefer grill meat or chicken. In addition I should eat yogurt and I should drink five glass of water everyday. Another important aspect I should avoid sugar chocolate ice cream that have a lot of calories and calories is not correspond my diet . The last important thing is that I should do exercise or sing up at sport center . I think second alternative is better then ones because I need professional helping. I know if I can start diet I rely on me to lose my weight because I lost weight after my pregnant. Why can I do it again
