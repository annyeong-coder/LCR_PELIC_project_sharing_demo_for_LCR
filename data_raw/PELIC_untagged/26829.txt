City of Gold and Elite Troop both of which I've seen have made enormous success in all Latin America. These movies directed by Barreto were produced in Rio Janeiro and portray the real reality of which is the violence today in Brazil. These histories based on gangs police and politician have been calling attention of all Brazilian due to their approach that is very close of all citizens. The film will likely do more success when enter in cinema of the whole world I believe since there are many people increasingly interested in knowing Brazil. Therefore I recommend movies of which Barretos drove. He is the director trying to express the reality of the streets.
