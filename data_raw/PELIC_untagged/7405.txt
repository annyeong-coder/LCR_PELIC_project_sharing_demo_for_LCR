My hometown is Seoul in Korea. Seoul is a small city. However there are many tall buildings and cars. Therefore Seoul is always crowded. There are four seasons in Seoul so the weather of Seoul is similar than Pittsburgh. There is a Han river in Seoul the Han river crosses Seoul. Seoul has many short mountains. Therefore there are many hills in wavy roads and beautiful hiking place. Moreover Seoul has great night view. Finally Seoul has perfect transportation system that is very cheap and fast. For these reason Seoul is a good place for living.
