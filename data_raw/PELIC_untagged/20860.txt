The second solution or procedures is to improve the crime prevention tools and means for example when criminal sees that the market in equipped with security cameras he may quit the idea of rubbing it because he knows that he will be identified therefore by adding more cameras among the city we may decrease the number of crime.

Another example increasing the police cars around the city. Finally and the most important procedures are the ones which must be taken toward the criminals themselves to rehabilitate them and prevent them from doing the crime.
