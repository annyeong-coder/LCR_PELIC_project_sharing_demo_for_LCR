One of my best friend is Kaseem Biatly. He is Italian actor and diretor. I met him when I was teaching at Alfateh University in Libya. One day while I was working one of my friends who was studying in Italy called me. He told me that an Italian artist will be in Liby soon and he gave me how can I meet him. After I got the information I went to meet Kaseem in the airport. From that day we are friends. We worked together at same University for two years. Now he is returned to Italy and I came to US but we still friends and we call each other evry week.
