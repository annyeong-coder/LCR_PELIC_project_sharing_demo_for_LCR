My bedroom is a good place. Like most rooms it is a rectangle. When you walk in the door the first thing you can see the window on the back wall. A desk is under the window. My bookcases on both sides where I keep my books and papers. My computer desk is on the wall to the right. And my dresser next to the door. In the middle of the left wall is my bed. Even though my bedroom is very simple. I still love my bedroom because it has been with me for over ten years. List 1. Window on the back wall 2. Desk under the window 3. Bookcases on both sides 4.
