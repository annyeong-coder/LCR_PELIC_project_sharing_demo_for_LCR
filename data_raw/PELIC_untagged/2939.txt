For me a house has to have a good energy. Lucky me my house have a very good energy. My home is big with a fantastic feeling inside that cheers me up. I love to sit down in the living room in front of the fire place watching TV and looking through the windows. The house has great light comes through the big windows and fill in with good energy that leaves me feeling great. I love it. The kitchen is the place where I like to play around do my cooking and baking. I love travel but it always feel good come back home this is because I feel very good in my home. The only thing that I do not like so much is that I do not drive and I live far from everything so I have to use the public transportation to move around. To arrive at class by 10 00am I have to get on the bus at 8 10am. However I get by.
