HEALTH CARE ISSUE As many county Libya is one of these countries having health care issue and problems. Since longtime the health care in Libya became worse and worse. Health care system drops because of many issues low financial support from the government and male organization by health care institutions. Therefore people lost their trust on health care in Libya. The financial supply the hospitals are receiving from the government still not enough to improve the health care to buy good equipment for better diagnosis or to give good celery to the Doctors. Even the health care is free in Libya but still the hospitals are not able to give the proper health care for the resident. Putting unqualified and bad leader to control the health organization on of the most cause of health care failure. Most the health organization did not have good planning to improve health care due to people work and control the health system are not qualified or just work to steel money. They didn't care to much to do the best for health care they care how they can get money from their position as leader. As a result of all these causes many people lost their trust in health system. Because they didn't get the proper health care even it's free but they prefer to go to the private clinics to get the proper care they reserve. Due to low celery for the Doctors most the expert Doctors start working in private clinics therefore most of the people go to private clinic. Even we have High educated people and smart Doctors but this is not enough to improve health care. We need a big step from everyone mainly the government to have good health system. Sometimes I prefer to pay for health insurance to get good care instead of free health care giving nothing.
