I was born October first nineteen seventy eight Incheon city in South Korea. At that time my mother wasn't full term expected date of confinement. After all I was born just seven month and half a month. As a result I was very weak and I had to spend many time staying in the children's hospital. When I discharged from hospital I was gone to my grandmother's home because my parents felt not well to do. Both of My father and mother was doing work. I was brought up by grandmother. My childhood was bent on making trouble. Sometimes I was cruel to a dog pulled out a weed on the garden. When I was seven years old I departed from grandmother house for enter a grade school in Seoul. And I passed many times at that until graduate high school. I think that my personality had changed at that time also. Actually I don't have many friends. My personality was usually shy silence. But I have changed my personality after make many friends in Seoul. In 1998 I went on to the college. My major was Emergency Medical Technology. That was collected in my personality. After graduate college I passed test and took a license as Korean EMT. Maybe I was remembering that I was feeling happy so much at that. As an EMT I saved my careers a man with a long time worked at university hospital. For six years had worked at hospital I thought challenge to well done by my career as an EMT from last year. That was going to US for study. But I had the source of trouble. That was rightly worry about parents' health. Both of two person had been hypotension and heart disease. I was in agony about have to go US whether or not. So someday my mother said We are OK. Don't worry about that. This is your life. We want to you will be good. After heard this say I screwed up and I'm in here now.
