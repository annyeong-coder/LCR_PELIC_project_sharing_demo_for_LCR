Some people think that men are better parents than women. In my opinion women are better parents than men. Of course you have the closest person in the world who is most likely your Mother a woman who gave you a birth raised you and supported during your life. It turned to be that the main function of a woman is to bring about a new generation and care for it. Naturally the role of a woman is to dedicate herself to nursing and raising children and take care of the house. Also biologically women are more gentle and sincere loving and kind than men who are fighters and providers who should always stay strong and ready to protect the family. Moreover mother is a person who you can come to at any time and ask for advice and support who will always host and aid you. Of course women are better parents but an ideal family can t exist without both mother and father.
