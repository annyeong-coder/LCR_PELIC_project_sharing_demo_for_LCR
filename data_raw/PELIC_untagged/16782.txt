In my talk time leader's case she has studied Japanese for four years although she is a native speaker of English. English is getting popular a person who only can speak English don't have any merit because many people can speak English very well. Moreover the economy is getting worse some people want to find a job not in the states but in other oversea countries. That's why bilingual and multilingual speakers are generated.
