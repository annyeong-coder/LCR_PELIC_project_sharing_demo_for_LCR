Nowadays many people like to live in a small town rather than live in a big city. In my opinion there are many differences between live in small town and live in a big city. Both of which have some disadvantages. First the security issue is a problem in live in a small town. Because living in a small town there might be some thief would come to your house compared to living in big city there are some management property manage those apartment or house and you might need an access to enter those buildings. Second the traffic is a big problem if you live in a big city. In a small town there won't be crowded traffic compared to live in a big city there would be crowded traffic every weekdays. But there are also some similarities between live in a small town and live in a big city. For example if you own a house in a big city you can still live well just like in a small town.
