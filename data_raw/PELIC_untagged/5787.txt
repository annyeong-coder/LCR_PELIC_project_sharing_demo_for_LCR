In fact I like to do money things when I lived in my country. I wanted to visit Abha city in my country but I had never visited it before. In addition I wish I studied english when I finished high school but I had never stadied it befroe I came to U. S. . Actuality I love to travel to Eygpt to see Eygpt's History but I had never seen Eygpt.
