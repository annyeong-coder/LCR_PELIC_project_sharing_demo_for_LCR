I had never paid utility before I came to the US. When I was in korea I wasn't the one who takes care of bills. So I'd never paid utility before I came to the US. And I also had never gone to grocery shop by myself before I started to live in the US. I only went to grocery shop with my mother when I needed something. Because I wasn't the one who cooks. And I also had never paid tip in restaurant before I came here. In korea we don't pay tip in the restaurant. The total price includes tip. So I didn't have to pay tip separately. Now I am getting used to live this new american life.
