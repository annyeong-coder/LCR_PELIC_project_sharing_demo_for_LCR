It is a long time that I haven't back to my grandpa's house since he was dead. My grandpa is a nice person whose ears have some problems. You might feel pity for this but I think he is lucky. Maybe this is the crucial reason that he could keep a good relationship with my grandma who really is a gabber. I spent most of my vacation in my grandpa's house when I was a child. It locates in the countryside where little people live in. It's a big house. There are many rooms in which you can find so many interesting antiques. Usually I played together with my brother in the back yard where many walnuts grow in. When I had any dissension with my brother he was the only person on whom I could depend. I miss my grandpa very much.
