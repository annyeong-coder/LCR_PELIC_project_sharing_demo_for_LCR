When I was a child I was very active and a lot of people thought that I was lazy and annoying. I might have been a little insecure and I could have used a bad way to express myself . I might have behaved in a wrong way and of Corse now I regret my bad behavior and I say I shouldn't have done some of it because I respect people feeling and way of life. Especially I must not have bothered my parents and I must not have said a bad word. I'm sure that I'm mature right now and I try to correct all my mistake in order to be a better person .
