My topic is young people. I think that young people's age is between 20 and 28. In my country most young people do many things. For example they like to shop. When they are shopping they buy many things that cosmetics jewels and fashionable clothes. These are very interesting to them. Sometimes they also enjoy watching movies. They usually go to at theater. That's different that they like to kind of movies. In case of me I like kind of inversion SF and thriller movies. Also they often change their hair When they feel bad or broken their boyfriend or girlfriend. So that they and feel that their stress is gone. And When they meet their friends they a lot of spend time that they usually talk at that time. They like to drink so they often drink beer. Finally they'd like to have a part time job where relation their major fast food stores or wedding shops so on. So they are ready to get another job in the future.
