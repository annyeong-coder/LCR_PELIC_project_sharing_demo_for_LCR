About Myself I am Hye Jin Last Name . I have been living in Pittsburgh for 5 months. I had lived in Seoul Korea before I came here. My husband came here as a visiting professor at University of Pittsburgh so I followed him with my two daughters. I had been teaching Korean Traditional Patchwork at the culture center before I came here. Korean traditional patchwork is a kind of quilt. Long time ago the common people didn't have much fabric so they collected the remnants of fabric after they had made clothes. Then they matched the size and color and saw them together to the size they wanted. Their completed works looked very unique like the modern abstract painting although they made them in 300 hundred years ago. We are planning to go back to Seoul in the end of this year. I am taking the ESL classes in ELI to improve my English now. I hope I can teach the Korean Traditional Patchwork in English for the foreigners who want to learn it in Seoul after going back to my country.
