Causes of Happiness Happiness is what actually makes us alive. Almost all inventions and creations where made because of people who experienced happiness. If we look around we'll see amazing things like buildings sub ways and airplanes we'll know what these people have made. We'll notice that there is a historical relation between happiness and ways of living. Our happiness is affected by actions and acts of others. Because of family neighbors and even coworkers affecting our emotions our happiness is affected by their actions. The smallest act or even a word from others can change our minds and thoughts. The actions of people around us decided our bath. We'll make a positive action because of receiving a positive affect. But if we get a negative affect we'll make horrible decisions. People can be the reason of their own happiness. Sometimes our own actions give us different emotions. Every single act that we make or even the things that we say affect our feelings. If we said or act badly we'll feel guilty and act wrong. And only happiness will get due to acts in good way. Many people believe that destiny or fate is the major reason of happiness. Things that happened to us or that we do and did they are all destined to be. Some people sometimes experience different emotions in different times without a reason. They believe that it's destined for them to have these feelings so their next action will be decided according to these emotions. Because of happiness being the target of all humans it's not easy to gain. All of us are trying to find better ways to reach happiness. Our own actions and others' affect our happiness. I believe that people are responsible for their own actions and happiness.
