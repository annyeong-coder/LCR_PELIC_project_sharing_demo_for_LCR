As far as I am concerned the most important relationship to me is the friendship between me and ANON_NAME_0 GAO who was my classmate when we were in China. That was 3 years ago when I was a graduate student in USTC Mr. Gao and I were in the same major and his dorm was next to mine. The first time I met him was an accidental. Because the university was far from the downtown we have nothing to do for fun everyone felt boring. One day when I went back to my dorm I got the smell of barbecue. I really like it greatly! Follow the smell I arrived at Mr. Gao's dorm. He was enjoying chicken wings and sausages. Then he let me sit down and gave me a bottle of beer. We drank and ate meat until midnight. Then we became best friends. Now although he is in Mississippi and I'm in Pittsburgh we still keep touch with each other tightly because friendship should be eternal.
