A Childhood Memory In the summer of 1987 when I was around eleven years old my aunt Tuya who was my role model at that time got married. It was almost like a ritual that every summer I would go to Hailaast which is located in 60 miles from my city for summer break. Although I was very excited about my favorite aunt getting married I could never imagine how that summer would be the most memorable event of my childhood. At the wedding I was the flower girl so I was everywhere and took many pictures with everyone. The reception was held at Bayangol restaurant where I always wanted to go eat was wonderful. I will never forget the summer of 1987 which is one of the most memorable times of my childhood.
