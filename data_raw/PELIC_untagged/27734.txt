I'd like to write about my house in Japan. We live in a small apartment which has one dining room and two bedrooms. I laid a small room out for my study room. I set my computer up in my room and keep away important papers and books from my daughters. When we are going to sleep We put two futons down in another room and four of us sleep together. In a morning we fold the futons up and put them in the closet every day and the sleeping room turns to kid's room. I like time for sleep because I read picture book to my older daughter every night. It is important communication for us. It is very difficult to clean our room up because there are two little girls. They always leave toys around the room and spill drink on the floor many times. We often let my older daughter put them away and she does it but we can't suppress children's curiosity. Soon our house becomes a mess! Japanese apartments are narrow and it is expensive in urban place. I was very surprised when I came to Pittsburgh. Everything is larger and has more room. . . I'm really jealous!
