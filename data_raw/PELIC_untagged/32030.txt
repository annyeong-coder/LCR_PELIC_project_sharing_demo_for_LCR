Studying nursing in English was very difficult because I had to understand every detail so I had to translate each single ward from English to Arabic in order to study. In the beginning it was time consuming and frustrating but I kept trying till I found out that I started to memorize allot of the words. That really remained me of that story. It is true that slow and steady wins the race. Now I am graduated nurse with good knowledge.
