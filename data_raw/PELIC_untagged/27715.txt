I picked up the phone call from a scammer. He told me that some problems with my banking account had turned up. In the beginning I felt nervous about this and kept on asking him how to solve those problems. And then he said that I had to fill some forms out on the website. He also talked me into signing up for their group. Finally I thought it over and found out it was very strange. I asked him to leave his phone numbers and then I could call his back to make sure this was the right numbers. Suddenly he hung up the phone. I figured out that he was a scammer.
