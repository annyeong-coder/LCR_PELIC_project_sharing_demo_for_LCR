Riyadh where I grew up is the capital city of Saudi Arabia. My family was living in a house which was rented from a company. Then my father when I was 5 years old bought a house in which I grew up and had my best memories. In our new neighborhood a lot of people who are nice helped us in moving to our new house. ANON_NAME_0 whose house is in front of my house is my best friend and ANON_NAME_0's father who is working for a bank was my father's best friend. ANON_NAME_0's cousin whom I met is a famous a soccer player. I'd gone to his club for which he was playing many times with ANON_NAME_0. I'd met many players who were my best players in that time many times. ANON_NAME_0 and I used to set in a store which belongs to one my relatives and we were helping him in selling. My relative to whom I like to talk is a good business man. In summary ANON_NAME_0 and I enjoyed our childhood when we were growing up. ANON_NAME_0 whose father was my father's best friend is a kind person. I still remember where and when I met him.
