This is a first time to go out abroad from my country. Coming to here I had experienced many things I couldn't before. I had boarded a plane but I've never boarded a international flight. It was very long and boring flight. Also I've never talked with non English speaker. In ELI there are many different races. Talking with them is so exciting! And I've never gone to a stadium to watch a baseball game. But I had gone to the stadium with ELI classmates. I expect activities in ELI from now on. There must be many things I've never seen before!
