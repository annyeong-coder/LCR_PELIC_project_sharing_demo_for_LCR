The winter In the winter there are many descriptions that make me feel bleak and sad for several reasons. After being snowing the sky looks dark and boring and the entire road got dirty and you can't see the road so clearly. The cars look like they are skiing on the black ice and a lot of accidents happen especially during this time of the year. There was nobody outside. It's kind of bleakness city and dark and it's emptiness from the people except those who are a homeless. The afternoon is very short the sun set very early and it become dark soon. The degrees temperature is very low and it's keep the people inside of there houses. They life in the roads is almost like some annual hibernation for some of the animal in the city. Everybody should wear heavy clothes and the kids too. I feel boring and sad and life is empty from anything like fun it's hard to travel by driving too. The tree is throwing its leaves and looks like it's exchanged the leaves with snow. It's really boring sad dark and scary views at this special time of the year during the winter.
