How to make a rhubarb pie I like rhubarb pie very much so today I want to introduce how to make rhubarb Pie. First put 1 2 flour 1 egg 1 cup of water and 1 teaspoon salt into a big bowl. Mix them until it getting to a ball shape. Second take a bake plant and make a basic cake. Third put 3 teaspoons sugar with rhubarb until they mix and melt. Forth put the rhubarb on the top of basic cake and put them into the oven. Last use 200 degree and bake for 20 minutes it will be done. When you eat the pie do not forget put cream on the top of pie. I never eat rhubarb pie during last 23 years. When I arrival to Pittsburgh that is my first time. It is very delicious and I stick with it after the first tying. Another reason is my home stay they grow the rhubarb by themselves so after dinner we always eat the rhubarb pie. Compare with others like cheery pie cheesecake and ice cream and so on I think rhubarb pie is the best.
