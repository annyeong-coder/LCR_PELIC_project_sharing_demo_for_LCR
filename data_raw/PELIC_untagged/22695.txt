My apartment has a beautiful furniture and a huge living room . When you enter to my apartment you will see the large kitchen in the right . Next the kitchen there is small table I pout it before you login in the living room. On the right garner in my living room there is dinning table and six chair around it . I developed the flowers in the table . In the wall close to the dinning table I hung some paintings. In the morning I do not use to the light there is big window in the living room. I am tired with clean my living room because I have rugs there and it has light color. In the middle there is five sofas between the sofa there is small table it is color brown . In the right corner and close to the window there is balcony door usually I open the is door if I want the air come in my apartment . Close to the door I putted TV stand and any one stay in the sofa you can see the TV . I like stay on the left corner and close to the TV stand because there is fish tank. I like my apartment because I can comfort after tired day in a bid living room and nice furniture .
