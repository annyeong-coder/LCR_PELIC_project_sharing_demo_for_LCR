There are several things in my apartment make I feel good and feel dad. First of all my apartment is quiet. This cheers me up when I have test or homework. I can go on studying for several hours. Second the light in my apartment is not enough that cause I have to light up other lamp. Also my apartment is hot so I must turn on the air condition but not for long time because I should pay the electricity ball so I may turn off the air condition. Third my neighbor put up her sound I couldn't find out the solved I really can't figure out this problem. In addition I don't give up finding out the solution. Finally my apartment sometime is comfortable and sometime is trouble.
