The other day I watched a TV show in which Paris Hilton is looking for a new friend. The competitors who wore fashionable clothes and were young girls cried when they lost. I wondered if they can be real friends even if they win the contest. I have friends who chose me through no contest in Japan the U. S. And other countries. My friend who lives in Vietnam is pregnant. The other friend who lives in Japan married this month. The friends who can share pleasures and happiness are nice.
