If I had been born the opposite gender my mom wouldnt have bought me nice skirts my brother wouldnt have called me as his sister and I couldn't have dated with guys. I could have kids if I dated with a nice girl and got married. Also if I were born a boy I would be an aerospece engineer because I am interested in aircraft.
