Sport is very important part of our life now. A lot of people enjoy many types of sports. In the main team sport or individual sports. My husband likes to watch team sport game such as baseball basketball American football and soccer. His favorite sport is soccer. He used to play soccer with his friends on the playground after school everyday in his childhood. But now he is so busy in working he has no enough free time to play although he continues to play on every Saturday afternoon. I just interest in watching soccer game only. I like individual sports such as tennis swimming badminton skiing jogging etc. I enjoyed swimming this summer and I am going to go skiing this winter. I think you could see the fun of playing that you interest in easily. Sports are also good for our health. You will be relaxing when you enjoy playing. If you want to keep your weight and get a nice body sport is best way! Today sports have become an industry. More and more people will be connected with sports.
