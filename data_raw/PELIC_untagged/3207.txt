My friend is Muhsin. He is from Saudi Arabia but now he lives in Bahrain because he is teaching there he has lived in Saudi Arabic for 20 years. He is 23 years old. He has been married since 2005. He has studied math at the university of King ANON_NAME_0 in Saudi Arabia for four years and he has graduated since 2005. He has been a math teacher and has been teaching for two years. He teaches 16 classes every week in high school. He likes his job and he is working on his master's degree. He was my neighbor and we were friends that more for 10 years so we had a nice childhood for example we often went out together and played. He and I have studied religion together in the mosques siren 1998. He and I have studied together some math courses at the University of King ANON_NAME_0 since 2004 and he has continued his major but I haven't continued my major. We have lived in the same apartment for one year when we studied. He and I have taught a special class for free for five years so many people in my city liked it now they miss us. I choose this person because I have had a good childhood with him for 10 years we help still each other and we often have similar ideas.
