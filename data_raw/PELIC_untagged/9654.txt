I have become interested in woodworking recently because like most people it feels good to create something and to accomplish something no matter how small hence last week I made a small book case in my woodworking class. Making a bookcase is very easy when you follow these steps. First of all you need some materials wood nails glue a hummer a saw a sandpaper and paint. After get all equipment let's illustrate how to make a bookcase. The first step cut wood 2 side pieces 11 5 8 by 28. Then cut wood 3 identical pieces for bottom top and shelf about 11 5 8 by 13 by 28 and two 10 wood for molting strips. Second step is that sand each piece of wood to acquire smooth wood. Then glue one molding strips to each side piece 14 down from top. Third step nail side pieces to bottom and nail the top in a place. After nail the last piece of back piece in place. When you finish nailing painting the bookcase and shelf let dry two hours. Finally after wait two hours for dry slide the shelf into place. Now your bookcase is ready to utilize. As you can see it is really simple to create new things.
