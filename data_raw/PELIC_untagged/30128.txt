My topic for essay is that Chinese high school students should not spend a lot of time on studying subjects . I want to argue about high school education in China. Many people in China think that high school students should study very hard on their subject because they need pass the SAT if they want to go to colleges. However some other people said that Chinese high school education is not good for student's future. Because they spend almost 80 percent of their time on studying subject. They don't learn anything about outside world.
