Before I came to Pittsburgh I had never gone trip with my sister. My sister is older than me about 7years old. So we couldn't spend with each other. She was always busy. But I often go to trip with my sister. When I lived in my country I had not yet gone to the church every Sunday. I didn't believe the God Lord . But my sister recommended to me. The first time I was bored in the church. Now I usually go to the church for listen the minister's sermon. Before I came to Pittsburgh I had never played golf. I don't like to do sports. But I am interest in playing golf. So I am learning to play golf from my sister and brother in law. I am getting good health and relation with my family.
