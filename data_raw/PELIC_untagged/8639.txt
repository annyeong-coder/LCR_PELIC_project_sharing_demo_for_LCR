After graduation from junior high school I chose to enter an industrial high school not a normal high school which most students go to for I did not have high grades to attend good high schools which I wanted to. The most important reason is at that time I did not like study. If I could go back to my young age I would have made a different choice. I wish that I could have enjoyed study and had worked hard. If so I would have gotten high enough scores and attended in normal high school. Because normal high school has more literature classes than industrial high school does. If I had attended in a normal high school I might have learned more knowledge about history music and art. Then I would share more information about my hometown to ELI classmates when we are chatting. If I had not studied in industrial high school on the contrary I would not know how to fix a great deal of electrical equipment. I might not have gotten married with my wife because after graduation from high school I studied in a technology university. In any way if I had chosen the other kind of high school my life would be totally different but however I am not sure if that would be better than I am.
