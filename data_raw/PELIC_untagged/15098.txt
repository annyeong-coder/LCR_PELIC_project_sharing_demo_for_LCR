I have been falling in love with cooking since I was 9 years old. I found my way through the kitchen and I liked what I found. I have been feeling so much joy since then. After a while what started as a hoppy has become a future job. I have been working in Olive Garden for 3 months when I decided to get a professional education in the field that I love the most. I applied to the Art Institute of Pittsburgh. I have been studying there since that time.
