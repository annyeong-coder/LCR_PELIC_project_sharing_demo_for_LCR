Dawalii is my favorite food. Dawalii or grape leaves is a Middle Eastern food which comes originally from Syria. Grape leaves is a food that is made mainly with meat and rice wrapped in a grape tree leaf. To make this dish you first need to get pickled grape leaves Egyption rice ground lamb meat any kind of meat would work . First we make the stuffing which consists of rice and meat and some spices. Then we wrap the stuffing we made very tight by grape leaves. After that we put them in a pot and fill the pot with water. Finally we put them in the oven until hey are ready to eat.
