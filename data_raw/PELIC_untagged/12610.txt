I live in a townhouse which has two stories and three bedrooms. Living room kitchen and my first daughter's room are in the first floor. On the second floor there are master's room the other daughter's room and bathroom. In the living room the white sofa which has three seats is in the middle of room against the wall which has a big window. Television which my niece gave us is on the opposite of the sofa. On the right side of the wall two desks which we bought at IKEA are next to each other. There are two lap tops which we brought from Korea and a printer are on the desks. On the left side of sofa there is an armchair on which I sit when I read a book.
