A friend is someone who helps you any time you need. He is a person who offers his service without waiting for any thing in return. Also he is the first person who shows up in your mind to ask him for any information or help. For example your friend is a person who you can ask him to look after your kids for a short while. In addition the friend is a person who you can invite for having lunch together. Furthermore he is a person whose home feels you that it is yours. I think that the friend is someone who you can tell about what is bothering you. He is a real person who really cares about you. In fact the friend is the mirror which reflects your characteristics.
