How to do Cardiopulmonary resuscitation Cardiopulmonary resuscitation is very important process for life saving. Everyone has prospects of meeting an unconscious person. Do you understand how to do it at such a time There is a possibility that many lives are saved from the swift response of us when we know this process. This process is comprised of three basic steps Airway Breathing and Circulation. First when you confirmed the unconscious person you must call for help and an ambulance. At the same time you have to secure a clear airway. The airway management is called that an open pathway between a patient's lung and the outside world. It is not possible to revive because air does not enter lungs even if providing artificial respiration if the airway is not secured. The simplest way of a clear airway is your hand puts on the forehead of the patient and bend the head back softly. Then you need to put under the chin and lift the chin by the other hand. Second you have to check confirmation of breath. You need to look listen and feel for breathing for 10 second. You have to give rescue breathing if breathing has stopped. You must pinch nose cover the mouth with yours and blow until you see the chest rise. Give two breaths. Each breath should take one second. Finally if the patient is still not breathing normally coughing or moving you should perform cardiac compression. Push down on the chest 11 2 to two inches 30 times right between the nipples. Pump at the rate of 100 minute faster than once per second. You have to continue with two breaths and 30 pumps until help arrives. We have a penchant for taking too serious about the cardiopulmonary resuscitation. However it is three simple life saving maneuvers. If you face to the unconscious person you could plunge into the cardiopulmonary resuscitation. You can do life saving.
