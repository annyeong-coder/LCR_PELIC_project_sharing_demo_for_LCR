I prefer kind of punky music and hiphop music. Specically I don't have to like singer. I'm just feeling of injoy when I listen to music. That is important to me. I listen to music of ANON_NAME_0 Lopez Beyonce and movie of Chicago very often. When I'm melancholy feeling I listen to punky music. It is helped me. But if I listen to music of very quiet. Kind of R B I may more blue better then. So I don't listen to quiet music easily.
