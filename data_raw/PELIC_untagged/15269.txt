There are four people in my family. My father and mother met each other in a school as a teacher. They are still teachers and they are easily able to teach to someone. When my father was young he had a gift which is playing soccer very well. Before he was a student of University He was a member of the youth national soccer team. He could keep playing soccer but my grandfather didn't want him to be a soccer player. On the other hands my mother can be a nice chef just for my family. Everyone knows the job as mom is one of the most difficult. I thank her for everything what she did for me. Also my sister is nice for me although we used to fight a lot. I guess that is why we are friendly. She can also speak English. She had lived in Virginia during two years with host family. Her English is absolutely better than me. All of us can do different things and have different personality. To love each other is able to make us happy.
