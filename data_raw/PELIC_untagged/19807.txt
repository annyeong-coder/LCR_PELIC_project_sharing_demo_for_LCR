My hometown is Seoul which is a capital of South Korea. There are four seasons spring summer fall and winter. Many flowers which represent spring such as golden bell trees azaleas and magnolias bloom in that season. People who like flowers go to somewhere to exhibit lots of flowers. Hot and humid weather continues throughout a rainy season in summer. Also most people go on vacations such as mountains or beaches where people avoid hot and humid weather. People go to mountains which ablaze with autumnal tints in fall. Mt. Seorak which is located in the east of South Korea is one of the most famous places for that autumn colors. It is cold and snowing in winter. People who like skiing and skating wait for winter coming.
