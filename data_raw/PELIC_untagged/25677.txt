Since 1999 when I was graduated from a high school I did not have regular language education at language institutes or schools. Therefore I am going to write about my experience in studying English at my high school from 1997 to 1999. At that time most teachers in South Korea focused on how students can achieve better grades in English exams hence they mainly taught students grammar and reading parts in English. The UNDERLYING PHILOSOPHY of Korean teachers is that getting good scores is better than using practical English. In addition the class is neither efficient nor effective because there are many students about 50 students in one classroom. In fact many teachers had never been to the U. S. Or the U. K. But they had studied English using only textbooks in South Korea. Of course only one native speaker in my high school had taught us English for 1 hour a week but I cannot remember what I studied at that class. However ELI classes in the U. S. Are quite different from English classes in South Korea. First professionalism is the most important ATTRIBUTES in ELI teachers. They are also native speaker and focusing on how to use English in the real world. The best thing of ELI in the U. S. Is that there are about 10 students in the classroom.
