As a result of winning a lottery I will divide money and give it to my mother father and younger brother and then I could travel around the world. Because I enjoy traveling and taking photos. However I will not stay in five stars hotel I would like to travel like a backpacker because you can feel a true journey and I want to go everywhere I want after that I want to do my master degree in Business and start my own tour guide company and write the books about country that I visit therefore I can make money in the same time when I travel. Also I would like to have a lovely house that our family stay together and have 5 golden retrievers in the house. In conclusion these are 6 things that I would like to do if I win a lottery.
