If I can save energy in my life I want to do like this. First I don't drive a lot of car and use bus to go to school so I can save a little gas that I use in everyday. Then I can watch a little times for TV so I can save the electricity. Actually my apartment rent fee include all of the stuff except electricity so I need to save the electricity fee for my apartment. The last thing I need to save energy that is air conditioner. Air conditioner use a lot of electricity so I can use a short time for the air conditioner. All of these things that can save the energy in my everyday life.
