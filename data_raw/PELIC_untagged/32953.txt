The article by Grethen Reynolds on May 23 2012 entitled 'Is Marathon Running Bad for the Heart ' talks about the potential risk of suffering a heart attack due to competing in marathons after a 58 year old man named Micah True died in such an event. It referred mainly to two studies on the death rates between the years 2000 and 2009. The first one revealed that 28 individuals passed away while the second claimed that 42 did on the avreage age of 42. The research showed that the possibility of dying due to racing is relatively small less than 1 in 100 000 people to be precise. In fact running could help prevent heart problems but other factors are involved as well. The article concluded that paricipating in marathons is safe for the most part.
