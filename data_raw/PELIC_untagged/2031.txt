1. Describe a situation that has turned out differently from what you expected. I used to take English course for preparing to take a Toefl test in Thailand. I took the test two times but I did not do well. My goal was to get a Toefl score at least 550. By the time I graduated I had planned to reach my goal so I had been studying in English. However in the last semester of my graduation I had to do a lot of works such as examination project report research and Toefl test so I could not do the test well. Thus my parents and I thought that if I was going to stay in the US for a while it would be easier to get a high score. I expected that I would not study hard for a test since I thought I was going to hang out with my foreign friends and speak English all the time. It would be enough for me but that's not true. Now I know that I have to study hard and try my best for the next test. Actually I have been here for 6 months and I have used English with my friends my teachers and some native speakers since I came here. In addition I have to study and prepare for the test so hard. I expect that I will get enough score for applying graduate schools in several states. Now I'm studying at the ELI and working on the Toefl preparation. By this April 2007 I will have gotten at least 100 in iBT score.
