My room is a small place. This week I was going to straighten up my room. This list is my schedule. First I thought to cover my sheet up. Then I took off my dirty clothing and put them in the washing machine. I put back my neat clothing in the wardrobe. I picked up my all shoes. Next I cleaned up the floor and moved around my desk. I took away the old light bulb and recycled it. Finally threw away the trash.
