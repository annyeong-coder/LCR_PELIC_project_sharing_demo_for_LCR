Hi Everyone My name is Sine and I'm Thai. All of the things in this capsule are mine. There is some money in the capsule from my country. I wanted to show how it may be different from money in your country. Don't be surprised with a lot of newspaper. It is different types. If you look at them you will see they are from the same day but they have different names. I wanted to show you the news from today before I closed this capsule. There are also many different items of clothes. I used to wear these clothes when I was a teenager. Also I have a few CDs that I would listen to every night. All the singers on the CDs were very popular. Have you heard any of these songs The last of my favorite things at this time is my grammar book because I am studying English and the grammar book makes me understand English better. Have you ever read a grammar book If not you should read one because it might help you understand English. I have several grammar books in my capsule. I hope everyone enjoys my capsule and you can see the difference between my time and your time. Love Sine
