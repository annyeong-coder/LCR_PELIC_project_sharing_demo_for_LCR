In our life we always try to find a true friend who can make us do what we can. Ralph Waldo Emerson . Recently friend is unique person who has been difficult to find it. We need seeking for long time to know who do good things for me and it's not for him. Furthermore friend is only a person who I can talk with him without any stress and I feel relaxing with him that I can say what I want. For instance everyone in this life is exposure to make a mistake or do a bad thing. After that he tries to find solving for this mistake. If he doesn't have a true friend he will find difficulty to solve his mistake. There are many characteristics that would be obvious in my friend. He must become loyal that will help us to constant our friendship forever. Also he should be generous which means loving to give and help people to do good things without thinking about what will do for him in the future. In addition he should be trust person who can save my secret or my mistakes that I did in my life. On the other hand if you'd like to know whom your friend you should travel with him any places to know him exactly.
