Explain how to plan for a vacation It is very interesting to take a vacation out of busy and boring daily. However to take a vacation meaningfully it is more important to make a adequate plan. Depending on your plan a vacation can be changed. First it is the most important to manage the time. If the time during a vacation is managed well someone can use 1 day as 1 week. In contrast although the long time is given someone the time can fly fast before he does something that he really wants. The phrase 'Time is gold' is also not exception in this circumstance. Second during a vacation if you want to go somewhere choosing a place is also important. This is also related to the time management. For example assume that a vacation for 3 days is given to a Korean man. As though he really wants to go to Europe his friend who knows Europe itinerary very well can recommend that he had better go to closed place because it is very short time regarding his plan. Also it is helpful to know your destination in advance and thereby it can be ready to enjoy a vacation. Third you must be ready for a unexpected situation. Although you make a plan very well a unexpected situation can occur anytime anywhere. In foreign trip if you miss your passport you must be embarrassed. In case of this accident you have to know a second plan in advance. Finally even if you take a wonderful vacation if you don't have a plan to return your daily this vacation can also be failed. This stage can be described as submitting homework. Even if you finish a excellent homework if this homework is not submitted it is the same not to finish homework. Obviously taking a vacation give you fun relax and vigor and a plan for a vacation can support your vacation. In addition it helps you save your money. Make a plan for a vacation to tell someone that your vacation was best when he asked for your vacation.
