If I hadn't joined the ELI I wouldn't have come to Pittsburgh. If I hadn't got the visa I would have stayed working in Saudi Arabia. If I didn't resin from my job I wouldn't be able to come. If I pass the TOFEL score I will get accepted in the program. I wish that I would be accepted in the university that I applied for. If only I could pass the GRE exam this would change my plans. If we pass the test they accept up. I hope that the test would be easy. I hope that I will be accepted soon. I wish that I could stay in Pittsburgh longer.
