This lecture is about myths of developing world that Han's Rosling shows. He realized that the problem is preconceived ideas and we need to communicate through his pre test which is relevant to child health in the world. In 1962 developing countries have short lives and large families. However in 2003 they have long lives and small families just like industrialized countries. In 1970 Asian had absolute poverty but they were getting out of poverty and others were getting into poverty in 2000. The connection between child survival and money is strong but huge gap between the rich and the poor with country exists. His stats in 1960 to 2003 shows that South Korea is making very fast advancement than Brazil and Uganda so it seems country can move fast if they are healthy first than wealthy. He said using average data is dangerous so the improvement of the world must be contextualized and more detailed. We can see happening in data in the coming year by using gapminder. As the number of Internet users are growing GDP is growing so the world is flattening out.
