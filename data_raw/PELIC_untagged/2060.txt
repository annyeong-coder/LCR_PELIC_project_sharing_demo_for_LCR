My name is ANON_NAME_0. I'm from Korea. Some friends call me Won because Won Il is too difficult to pronounce for them. I don't care what they call me because I understand it can be hard for them. Sometimes some classmates' names are really hard to pronounce for me. I like talking with my classmates. Therefore you will see that I'm always talking with them. I'm so glad to see many international friends. I enjoy knowing about different culture. Therefore I seldom play with Korean students but I want to play with international friends while I'm in the US. Now I'm doing my homework in the Hilman library and trying to finish it quickly. Then I want to rest at home.
