There will be blood based on the novel Oil! Is one of my favorite movies of decade. It is such an emotional movie that involves a tangle of relationships for an epic of greed and envy happened in the United States. The unbearable tension within the plot and music of this movie almost making me lose my breath is among the greatest performances I've seen. A monstrous and shattering petroleum speculator played by Daniel Day Lewis does a remarkable job as an American primitive in this movie. This oilman storms through California trying to persuade the prospective leasers to get involved in drilling by any means necessary. In a short time he has become a successful oilman with his own fast growing company. Before his son leaves him in the end he cares for no one except his adopted son whose father is died in a well. Through their spooky eyes I think I saw the painful pursuit of the American dream of success fame and wealth via thrift and hard work. Don't even question if you should see this brilliant work There Will be Blood or not. Just do it.
