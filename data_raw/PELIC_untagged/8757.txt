Last year I met someone who has become my best friend. My best friend is Mary who is ugly but is the kindest person I have ever met. She has a good personality. She cannot turn her back no people who are in trouble. She always helped them who need some help when she sees. We had a lot of time with each other. Sometimes we were hanging out with our friend who likes to play basketball. When we were with that friend we usually played a basketball. I think she is the only one who understands and is on my side without any reasons. Mary gave me the ring that has words written her name inside the ring. I still cherish the ring which reminded me of her. I hope as soon as I go back to Korea I will meet her and tell about my experience that I have done in the USA.
