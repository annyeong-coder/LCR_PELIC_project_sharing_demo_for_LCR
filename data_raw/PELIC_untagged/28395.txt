My neighbor's name is Ema and she is very cheerful person. Ema leaves early in the morning to her work. Ema is very quiet person but she is also reliable when it comes to assisting other people. People can easily contact Ema for anything. She is very helpful. Sometimes she speaks loudly when she is with elder people to help them hear better. My neighbor's house is very neat and gloomy. You can't see messy things in the house. Ema takes matters seriously in her life. My neighbor has lived happily with her husband for many decades.
