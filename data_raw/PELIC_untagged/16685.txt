Live in Pittsburgh. I study English in The University of Pittsburgh. I have been studying there for four months. I live in a small apartment in downtown. I like my apartment because my friends live in the same building. They are studying in Pitt University. Nevertheless I always watch TV in the night. Also I like reading book before I go to sleep.
