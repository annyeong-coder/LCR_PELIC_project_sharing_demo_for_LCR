Avatar starring Sigourney Weaver and other actors I didn't know before this movie is the first movie I watched after I came to Pittsburgh. This movie is about a long time later future when a human needs to mine a precious material under which Navi a native humanoid lives in the planet Pandora. This movie draws conflict between a native a human and an avatar. The story some of which are boring and ridiculous can be felt as typical science fiction movies'. However when this story was shown on the screen by 3D technology it provides totally different feelings to viewers wearing 3D glasses. This movie was directed by James Cameron the most of whose movies such as Terminator sequels and Titanic I really love. I think he is one of the most influencial movie directors in the world like Steven Spielberg who directed Star wars and other great SF movies. If you haven't watched this movie yet I really recommend this movie for experiencing how much technology is impoved nowaday. One thing which I want to say at last is that you will not see your companion's face clearly during watching and may feel some diziness as well because of 3D technology.
