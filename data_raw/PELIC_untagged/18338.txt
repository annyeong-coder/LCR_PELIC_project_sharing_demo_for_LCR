I think Gaviotas couldn't be successful because there is no rule can regulate them. They live like animal in the wild are can married with whoever they like no control no religion. For the short or medium term they can keep on but at the end they will fail. The innate of the human being make human a tool for doing goods and evils. For instance if someone kills someone else who will sue him if there is no police or jail The difficulties that can confront them are no integration between them they will be the cause of dismantling of their relationships and instead of tackling a problem they will the reason for making other problems.
