In many countries same sex schooling has been common but I think it is not good for students. The supporters of the same sex schooling usually has said students could more focus on their studies during their school days. However I have one reason why I disagree with it. The biggest reason is for a DIVERSITY of opinion. Many students do not have chances to talk with the opposite sex although they have to learn a DIVERSITY of opinion in their school. Boys and girls have to learn how to debate each other because the opposite sex are BIASED about same issues. The lack of DIVERSE debating causes that they cannot understand each other when they become adults.
