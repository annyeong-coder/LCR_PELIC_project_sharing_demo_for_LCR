In my last semester at ANON_NAME_0 Mai University I kept thinking what I would do after graduation. At the early semester my sister persuaded me to go to the U. S. For studying English at Pitt. She added that if I had studied English at Pitt my English skill would have been improved dramatically and it could help me get a good score in TOEFL and GRE which are a requirement for attending a graduate school. At that time I had 2 possible solutions. First if I had started finding a job I might have immediately gotten a job after graduation. I thought if I had worked for a while I would know whether I should study in master degree or keep working to get a promotion. I would know which particular field I want to study. Secondly I should go to the U. S. For studying English. I thought that if I had lived there it could have helped me design whether the U. S. Suited me or not and if it had suited me I would apply a graduate school in the U. S. Moreover I wished I would attend the school at the end of the year. Finally I designed to go to the U. S. Because my parents supported this idea. Now I'm living in Pittsburg and studying in ELI. I hope I could finish all of my applications by December.
