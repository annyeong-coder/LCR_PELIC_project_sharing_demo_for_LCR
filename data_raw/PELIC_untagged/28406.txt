I like my neighbor they are a big family and just live next to my house. Their family consist of 4 children 2 parents 2 grandparents 2 grand grandparents. Sometimes their children were came to my house to playing with my cousin noisily. Their parents and grandparents usually invite my aunt and me to come their house or had an American parties. Sometimes my aunt also were made a cakes or cookies to them we treat to each other friendly. They let me know what is the real American's life. They are very considerate and kindly I love my neighbor very much!
