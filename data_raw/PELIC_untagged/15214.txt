Hi everybody! I'm Anna Last Name . Welcome to my website. For two years I've thought about building my own website in order to share with people my art work. Last month I finally did it! So welcome!!! I grew up in Russia. I've been painting for almost all my live. When I was a child all the time instead of doing homework I painted in my exercise books. Fortunately I finished school well and I entered the College of Art! It was a great time! In the college I loved classes of Art History and of course practice courses where we honed our painting skills. We've painted a large number of pictures. I've been working as art teacher for couple of years. I had a great experience in sharing my skills with children! I graduated in July 2008. I've been living in Pittsburgh since I graduated. This year I've already gotten exhibitions of my art work. I've attached a lot of my pictures below. I hope you'll enjoy.
