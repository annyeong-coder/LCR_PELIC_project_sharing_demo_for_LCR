The worst meal experience I've ever had happened about 10 years ago. I was just 13 years old at that time. One day some classmates came to my home and we decided to cook lunch by ourselves. I just remember that one of my classmate cooked tomato and egg soup. It is a very general kind of soup but she made it have a strange taste. It was a disgusting taste. Because of this soup I couldn't eat tomato and egg soup for a very long time until I ate a wonderful tomato and egg soup.
