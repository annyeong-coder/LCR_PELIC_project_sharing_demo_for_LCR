Hi I m Ryan Last Name . I come from Saudi Arabia. I've written those paragraphs to give you some information about me. I grew up in Al Riyadh the capital of Saudi Arabia. When I graduated from high school I moved to Al Khobar city in eastern region of Saudi Arabia to attend King ANON_NAME_0 University of Petroleum and Minerals. After I graduated from the university I worked for five months. I've worked as a software engineer. Then I decided to come to the U. S. To do a masters degree. I've been searching for good universities in Pittsburgh and I found that Pittsburgh has many good schools. I've been living in Pittsburgh since October 2008. I've lived with a friendly American family. Then I moved in with a friend of mine and I've been looking for apartment since January. I hope I can find any before the end of this month.
