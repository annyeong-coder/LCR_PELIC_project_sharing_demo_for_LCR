Avatar is one of the most interesting movies I have ever seen. This is a story about one handicapped male. He joined the army who tried to attack a local tribe called Navi for precious ore extractions. James Cameron drew many themes such as being in the different culture understanding the different life style and having a choice in own life in his movie. If he had tried to show only these things he could have won the Academy Award. However he also had the other highlight in his movie. He showed the way army was. In his movie he also showed the bias in thoughts produced by the education in army. For the army men Navi people were just enemies and there was no choice except killing all of them. The archaeologists disagreed with attacking them because Navi people had the urban civilization and they were not only wild men. However the military men could not listen to them because they had already become brainwashed to think that they were just enemies. In the following paragraghs I will mention three main reasons why I disagree with the Mandatory Military Service these are preserving free will keeping freedom of thought and making young people join the society in appropriate age.
