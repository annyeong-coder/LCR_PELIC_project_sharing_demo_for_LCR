I asked Tako who is my classmate about the favorite way of wasting time. He said that his favorite way to was time is listening to music. Also he told me that he will do research next vacation. I asked him about his best friend and if he can give me a description of him. He replied that he has known his best friend for seven years and he also said that his best friend was student in the same university that he studied in. Tako said that his best friend is studying in England now. Tako and I talked about what we used to do when we were younger. He said that he used to play video games and I announced that I used to play soccer.
