When I was on the way home from Pitt I saw a car accident which happened just in front of me. A car intended to cross an intersection of two single way streets. Of course there was a stop sign on its way but not on the other. Then it was stopped before the stop sign and the driver checked the other street if it was safe to cross. Actually the direction of the other street was from the right to the left. She glanced toward the left side. As soon as she continued driving there was an engine sound made by a bus and coming from the right side. She might not have heard it and drove slowly. As the car was in the center of the intersection a loud piercing noise was produced out of the bus. The car which she used was crashed by the bus even though the bus tried to avoid hitting it directly. The car was forced to turn around ninety degrees and then stopped. The good thing was the car was hit on the passenger side and only she was in that car. She looked shocked and did not get hurt at all. Hopefully the riders on the bus were not hurt as well.
