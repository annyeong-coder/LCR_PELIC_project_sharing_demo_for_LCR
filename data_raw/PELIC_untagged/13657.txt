When I was in Korea I often used to pick up the phone from a life insurance telemarketer. When I figured out that the phone call was from the telemarketer I really wanted to hang up as soon as possible. I went on saying Sorry but I am not interested in your insurance or Sorry but I am very busy now. However the telemarketer didn't give up and kept on repeating the product advertisement. She continuously tried to talk me into buying the insurance. A few minutes later she got to notice that I was the person who would never sign up the insurance. Finally I could hang up.
