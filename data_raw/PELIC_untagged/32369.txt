Kony 2012 was made by invisible children. Jason is one of the members of invisible children. Ten years ago he went to Uganda. He discovered that children are caught and trained soldiers by LRI which leader is Kony. After understanding how bad circumstance of children is. He wanted to do something to change the situation. So he met some senators in D. C but they couldn't give him any help because it doesn't have any benefit for the US. He thought the only thing that he could do is to make more people aware this situation. After he got a lot supports he went to D. C and tried to convince government again. This time he succeeded because he had a lot of supports from normal people. However he considered that if people don't care this event anymore the government would cancel the project that is to arrest Kony. Therefore he believed that the best way to keep people care about the issue is to make Kony famous. Then he made this video and tried to attract more people to join a program called TRI .
