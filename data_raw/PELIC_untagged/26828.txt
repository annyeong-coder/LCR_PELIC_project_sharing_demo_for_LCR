Some Memories from My Childhood When was a child I used to fight with boys but now I'm free quite. My family did not use to travel in the vacations. We use to visit other member in our family. I used to be with my friends every day all times. Now I am trying to spend more time for studying and sitting with my family. This is making my mother too happy.
