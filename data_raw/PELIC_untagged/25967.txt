I was shocked when my husband told me that he had booked tickets to go back home this vacation. I told him when the flight will be He said it was on July 25th. I asked if he was sure. He said that he was sure 100 . When I was reading the ELI news I found the last exam would be on July 27th. I explained to him that I had reading final and grammar final on July 27th and listening final on July 27th. Then he called the travel agency and ask what day another flight was available. The clerk replied it was in August 1st. So he made a new reservation.
