Hello! Welcome to visit my website. Here is about my life in America. I've been building this since December 2006 I came to America. I've posted photos and blogs. If you click 'PHOTO ALBUMS'. There are some categories I divied. You can see not only pictures in America but also pictures in Europe and Japan. Since I went to the university I've travelled in other countries and taken pictures. You'll know how much I like travelling when you see them. I'm going to upload more pictures when I went to other cities in Amercia. And If you click 'MY BLOGS' you can read my blogs. I like keeping a diary so there are many things to read. I've been doing it before I bulit this website and you can see old ones too in 'THE LIFE in KOREA 06' Besides there are a few more meuns you can see like 'MUSIC' 'COOKING' and 'LINKS' which are my interests as well. I hope you have fun during seeing my website!
