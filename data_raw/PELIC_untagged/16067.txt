A What should we prepare for before we go on a desert island B I think the most important thing is the match. At the night we can not see anything due to the darkness. However if we have a match we are able to make a fire. A I agree with you. If we can make a fire we also cook some food in the desert. We must bring it to the desert. B What is another thing that we have got to bring A I think we had better prepare for a knife. A knife could not only protect us from a firece animal but also might be used when we are cooking. B You are right. Without a knife we will have a difficulty when we have to cut something. A I think we ought to bring some chocolate. B Chocolate A I know it may sound ridiculous. However it could be a great help when we are isolated and are dying to starvation. B Really I did not know that. We ought not to forget to bring chocolate.
