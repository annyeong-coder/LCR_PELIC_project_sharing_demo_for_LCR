Most people dream they could win the lottery I am one of them. If I win the lottery I can obtain a great deal of money immediately. Certainly I have many things to do after win the lottery. I will donate some of the money to the Chinese church. I also plan to invest lots of the money in the stock market. It's impossible to have no plans in my summer vacation. I would like to invite most of my ELI teachers to visit my country in where there are tons of tourist spots which show a considerable amount of Chinese traditional culture during hundreds and thousands years. The souvenir for every teacher is a set of my favorite brand comb. I believe that my teacher will surprise about such the set of delicate and elegant comb with the less cost.
