Improving air quality Air pollution problems are important environmental issues for many reasons. First of all the air pollution is harmful to human's health. For example many health hazards such as lung cancer skin cancer and brain damages are directly attributed to the excessive emission of carbon dioxide from automobiles and factories. In addition toxic gas in the atmosphere deteriorates buildings and structures. When the exhaust of burning fuel is released from an engine or automobile it floats to the air. Then when it rains the gas combines with the water and then forms the weak acid called carbonic acid . This acid gradually causes erosion at the surface of buildings towers or bridges. Not only does the air pollution affects human's life but it also affect animal's life. For example the acid rain contaminates water and kills thousands of sea animals each year. In my opinion 2 methods can be done to alleviate these problems. Firstly the use of automobile should be decreased. The government of each country should encourage people to use public transport instead of driving personal cars. Also personal automobile taxes and insurances can be increased in order to hamper buying a new vehicle. Secondly although we cannot reduce the number of factory we should come up with an effective air treatment system to cope with the toxic gas. Every factory must implement an air treatment system before releasing the gas to the atmosphere. I believe these 2 methods should be done in order to solve the air pollution problems.
