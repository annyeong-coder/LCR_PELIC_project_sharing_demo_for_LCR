I have lived in Pittsburgh for 4 months. I haven't applied for a credit card yet. I have already make friends with some people. I haven't been capable to talk with American easily yet. My son has studied at Menadeo Elementary school for two months. He has already made some improvement in his English learning. My wife has worked in pittsburgh since Jan. 18 2011. She hasn't aquired driving license yet.
