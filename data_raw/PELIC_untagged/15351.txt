I don't fit any personality types on the ANON_NAME_0 but I think that I am a rational person who makes right decisions and stays calm. However I've realized that I'm being emotional when I see the Patriots' goods. For example I bought a Patriots helmet because I aspired to get it but nowadays I'm thinking a way to bring it back to Japan and a time to wear it. Since yesterday I've lost my student ID card and a Patriot lanyard which was attached a card case. I was crying during I was looking for the lanyard which was more important than the card for me. After went back to home I cried again when I told that happening to my husband. He was surprised and said that I didn't show any tears when I watched the move of Jhon Q which Denzel Whashington is featuring even thought he cried. I was also surprised I was crying with the stupid reason at the times because I hadn't cried for nearly 10 years. I think the reason that I cried is that I bought the lanyard at Gillette Stadium in Boston and it remained me the memory. I hope that it wouldn't be thrown away and come back to me.
