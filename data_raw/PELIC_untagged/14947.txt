My partner's name is ANON_NAME_0. His name means a correct judgement. His grandmother gave this name for him. He is three children's daddy. If he uses a title in his name it may be someone's father ANON_NAME_0. Except this case he doesn't use a title anytime. And he doesn't have any nick name. So his friends just call him ANON_NAME_0. Although he likes his name very much in his country he has a different feeling about his name in America. Because of difficult pronunciation. He came from Libya. His country Libya is located in North Africa. But he is living in Green Tree of Pittsburgh now. He is studying English for continuing his study. He is going to get a Ph. D. In his major. His hobbies are playing a soccer and walking in the nature. He is very good guy.
