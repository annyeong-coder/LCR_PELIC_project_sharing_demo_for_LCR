I feel very secure when I get to my apartment. I always turn on the air conditioner when I come back home. When I leave my apartment I always leave on the TV. When ever I have guests I throw away the garbge so my apartment looks clean. I have to cover up the crack on the wall someday. Every time I come back to my apartment I light up the lights. I like to straighten up my apartment. When I get back from a long day I hang up my cloth. I would like to move around the furniture. I have to put up my new painting on the wall. I have a wall than needs to be touched up the paint is so old.
