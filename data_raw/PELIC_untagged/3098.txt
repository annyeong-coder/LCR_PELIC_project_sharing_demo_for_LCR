Dear Mr. ANON_NAME_0 I am a student at the EFL Computer Training Institute. My classes are pretty good for me but in the Computer Lab really has problems. First you should clean the room. It's so dirty. Secondly you ought to buy the computer more. Thirdly you had better change the window that is broken. And you should empty the trash. Fifthly you ought to fix the lamp. Lastly you had better change the office copier. It's very old. Thank you for read the this message.
