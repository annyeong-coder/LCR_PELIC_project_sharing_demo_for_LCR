The White House Washington D. C. 20500 07 20 2008 Res. President I am Jaya a high schoolteacher from India. I would like to invite your kind attention to a serious issue. In my country lots of children and young people are victims of cigeritte smoking. We tried to give them awareness by conducting many programs but no use because they are highly attracted by the ads of U. S. Cigaretts. Last week I read an article on smoking by a George Polk Award winner William Ecenbarger. From the reading I could understand that U. S. Government support cigarette companies to promote smoking all over the world. It's very pathetic because you are cutting the future of many children and future of many countries. From the reading I could understand that americans want their people get rid of smoking. Isn't unjustice Even in this 21st century keeping discrimination against people! I would like to invite your kind attention on this issue. I hope you are a good person and have a rethink on it. If you see the real consequences of smoking you will regret about it. So I kindly request you not to support cigarette companies and find some way to wipe out this evil from the world. Thank you very much. Sincerely jaya
