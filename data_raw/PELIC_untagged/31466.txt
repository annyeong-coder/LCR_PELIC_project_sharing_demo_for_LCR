There are several holidays in Saudi Arabia which is located in the Middle East. One is Eid Foter which is happening on the second half of the Arabian year. The second one is called Eid Adha which takes place in the end of the year. Most people on each Eids are dressed up with cloths which they didn't wear before. The joy of Eid is obvious on people who had a long year away from their loved ones. Everyone on the street is smiling and even your next house neighbor whose name you don't know is smiling at you. Visiting family and friends especially those whom are old and miss us the most.
