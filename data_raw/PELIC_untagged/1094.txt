When I was 20 years old. I failed in a course which is math in King ANON_NAME_0 University. I attended the course with I professor who I must not have been in his class. I was with friend of main. We printed our schedule and he took my schedule. So he couldn't have taken that semester. He dropped that term. The professor should have taken attendance for who is in his class but he did not. So I stilled with him until the first exam. After the test he didn't give me my great. In another hand my professor who I must have taken the class with him was taking attendance. So I got many absences and I failed in that course.
