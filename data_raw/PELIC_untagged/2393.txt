I've been living in Pittsburgh for six months. I applied a blog to record my life in the U. S. . I've been writing some diaries and articles there. I've also been posting a lot of photos since 2006. I've been sharing my ideas my favorite songs and books in my blog. My friends have written down some messages to me. I read and replied them. Except what I've been designing my blog I've been reading some books in my free time. I've read a series of books was written by Dan Brown. I've been reading a book Deception point for a week. Dan Brown has written a famous book da vinci code . Dan Brown's books are good you should try to read them.
