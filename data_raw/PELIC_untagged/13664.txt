My classroom is well ventilated and sunny. The room always cheers me up when I attend the class. When my teacher asks me some questions the surroundings help me work them out. In case that the question is difficult my teacher allows me to talk it over with classmates. Sometimes the classroom is messy so my classmates and I need not only to straighten it up but also to throw away pieces of paper.
