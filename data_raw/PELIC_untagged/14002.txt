Two years ago in December 10 2006 I went to Venezuela with my mother we visited my aunt in Valencia city. We took cakes with us as gift for my aunt. We stayed 15 days in this city we went to many places like museums the zoo the aquarium and restaurants also we went to the beach I swam in the ocean and I swallowed a little ocean water. After we went to Valencia we traveled to Caracas Venezuela's Capital we saw much pollution and it's a little dangerous because this city had robbers and poor people in the street. In Caracas we only stayed 3 days and we bought a few clothes for my three brothers. Finally on December 28 2006 we went back to Colombia with many suitcases.
