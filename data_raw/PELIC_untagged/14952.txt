I was born in Twawin and grow up in Taipei. When I studied in University I majoied in busness. In my sophomore I traveled Japan three days. Now I have studied English in Pitt for one month . Because I want to apply M. B. A programs therefore I need to pass Tofel and GMAT. But the most important thing is that I need to work experiemce at least 3 years. I have studied English for many years but our education focus on reading and writing so I need to improve my speech and listen. I already have listened mp3 about English at least 1 hour for 1 month. I hope that one day I can speak English fluently like negative speaker.
