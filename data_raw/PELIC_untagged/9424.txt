I come from Taiwan that's a small island nearby China. Taiwan is a modern country. But I live in a small town where is not modern in Taiwan it's called Taitung. In Taitung there are not too many modern building or the terrible traffic the only one it own is that good people beautiful morning attractive sunset and a lot of wonderful views. You can relax yourself there. A lot of people say living in Taitung just like living in the paradise . Going to Taitund you will realize what a real live is and how people should to live.
