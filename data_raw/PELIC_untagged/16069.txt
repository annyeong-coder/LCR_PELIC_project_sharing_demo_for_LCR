It was more than 10 years ago when my secondary school arranged for a trip to Tarhoona Mountain. The place which was 84 km faraway from Tripoli was the hometown of my best friends Emad and ANON_NAME_0. They were twin brothers. We were like a one team. We used to play go shopping and study together. Since they knew Tarhoona quite well Emad and ANON_NAME_0 wanted to be our leaders. They showed us their special leadership abilities tell we agreed about all their suggestions. After an enjoyable time the twins decided to try reaching the top of the mountain. Even it wasn't too high we had not to let them do so. It was our god's well. Emad fell down and sadness cloud covered our glee environments. I'm telling the sad part of my story first not to say that we shouldn't have gone to that trip but because I want the reader to share the second part of it with me. The other ANON_NAME_0 e mailed me last month telling me good news. He became a father. He informed me that the little Emad looks like his uncle. When I sew new Emad's pictures I said to him you should have got married some years ago so I might have seen the new Emad before I leave to America.
