Talking about my problem with my classmate or my teacher will solve my culture shock. First of all it is not hard to define my problem with my classmate. Additional My friend will understand my feeling and give me a good suggestion. Third my teacher can take care me of the other culture. In short I am so lucky because I have the best friend and the best teacher.
