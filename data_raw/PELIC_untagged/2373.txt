Many countries in the world aren't rich in natural resources their economy rely on tourism. And because Tourism is about having fun and relaxing forgetting work and life problem and enjoy natural view night life historical sites foods and restaurant. People always choose places where they can feel safe and relaxing. Of course if you are planning to visit Spain and suddenly a terrorist attack happen you change your mind because it will became an unsafe place to have fun and maybe a threat for your life. Also when you choose to take vacation you will go for a stable country with no political problem or protester on the street like Iraq or Africa or the middle east But you can visit China or Mexico or Europe and feel safe because a lot of people go their. Many businessman open firms in China for example. Many international meeting take place on these countries. Actually I agree with the article's prediction and I think that China is and it will be the first destination for tourism in 2020 because it has a giant economies and it doesn't have any well known problems.
