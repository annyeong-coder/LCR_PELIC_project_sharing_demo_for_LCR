Before I came to the United States I used to live in my home country Taiwan. For two years I used to work for a Taiwanese opera company in Taipei. Also I used to teach traditional Chinese musical instrument to junior and senior high school students. I used to go to work by subway everyday even on the weekends. Although I used to work so hard I enjoyed my busy working life. Now I am improving my English skills at ELI. I cannot work and also don't go to school everyday. I have a lot of free time to do the things that I wanted to do long time ago such as watching all the episodes from FRIENDS taking a walk in the sunny afternoon and spending all day in a huge shopping mall. After I can use English skills fluently I want to find a job in the United States because I love to work with other people.
