Last weekend was a three day weekend. Myfriends and I had planned to visit New York in that long weekend a couple of them were inspired to be in New York. Unfortunatly we didn't go because we found out that one of us was having an underlying reason to go to New York that didn't console us therefore we asked him to reveal the real reason t go with us but he answered us ambiguously. We decided to cancel the plan and threat that guy by not talking to him until he apolgy for what he did.
