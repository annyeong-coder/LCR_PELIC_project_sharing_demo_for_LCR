I met my best friend Myung Kun while I was going to church in Korea. Whenever we went to the church we were smoking in front of church after worship. Sometimes while we were smoking we felt a pleasant sensation. Even though he and I had strong individually each other and even had much troubles with each other but we still formed a strong friendship. While I was studying kind of a Korean S. A. T he gave up a college and he found a part time of job. After a couple days he bought a car by payment in installment. Since then whenever I finished my school at 10 00 P. M he picked me up everydays. While I was living in Korea I've met many friends. However I've never met anyone like my best friend Myung Kun. Sometimes we drank in a bar and we traveled many times. When he was working in a restaurant he met a girlfriend in 2004. At that time I had a girlfriend so we traveled many times with them. Today I miss my friend Myung Kun.
