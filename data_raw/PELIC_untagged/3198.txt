This is interesting argument . In my opinion each opinion have they own reason but I prefer frist opinion . Because I am a forgien student in here a lot of my friends in other country . I prefer gather all short vacation together to a big one . If like that I can have more time to travell to another country and meet my friends . Another reason that I support this opinion is you can have a long time to do something what you want to do maybe you want to get a part time job in long vacation but if too short nobody want to use you . If you want to study how to drive a car or study korea karate you should have at least 3 months become a low level student . All these reason depends on my opinion I don't know if other people will agree with me .
