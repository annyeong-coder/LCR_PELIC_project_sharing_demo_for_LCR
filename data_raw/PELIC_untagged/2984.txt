When I went back home four months ago I was completely afraid about what I'm going to see there because I stayed in America for seven months and no one has sent me any news about my country and my family. So I was thinking how my family does and also if something has changed there or not. All of these thought was in my mind when I was in the plane until we reached the airport in my country when the captain announced that. My heart was beating so fast at that moment maybe because this is the first time for me to be far away from my family and my country for a long time. So when I reached the airport I was knowing that no one knows that I'll be here this day. Then when I finished from baggage check I went through the security to get out of the airport terminal but before I reached the exit gate I heard someone was calling me and I was surprised about what I saw when I looked back there. It was all my family there and without any noticed from me I cried with my mother and my sisters because I haven't talk to them for long time. But I've my self how they knew that I'll be here that day and after that I asked my brother and he told me that his friend who was in the same institute with me studying English told him that I was coming at that day. I was a little angry about that and then I told my self should insult him for that but I realized that not fair because my family was missing me so much.
