Topic Aspects in eating habits in Peru and USA Introduccion I would like to talk about eating habits because I think that every country have a diferents aspects and diferents habits. Diferences 1. One of the things that I notice here and is very diferent from my country is the most important meal is the dinner I know everybody here use to have dinner early around 6 or 7 and in my country the most important meal is the lunch . We use to have a dinner but is not a dinner is something light maybe just milk and cereal. 2. Another aspects is in my country we use to eat healthy food because is diferent than here you can fin good prices in restaurant for healthy food and here if you want a eat healthy food is a little expensive and somethimes the people here prefer eat in fast food because is cheaper but not healthy. Sometimes takes more time if you want a make it and in Peru the most people have maid and is diferent because you have the food ready when you arrive home especially when you are in rush hour. Similarities 1 I can't find to much similarities in eating habits but the only that I find is we use to eat pastas and here everybody eats pasta to because is easy to do it and fast. Conclusion I think eating habits is very important and more in this year a lot of people have overweight and everyhthing is because the fast food is an easy way fast but is not good for our body. I think in this years the people is more concious about food and they are trying to eat healthy.
