Kung Fu Panda directed by J. Yuh is my favorite movie. The movie showing the relationship between the master and his students had a very beautiful meaning. Panda who is the hero of the movie was helping his father in the restaurant. The place which is in China is next to forbidden kingdom. The people who are living there are good people but there was a bad guy in the jail for 20 years waiting to be free to go back and make troubles. The only way to stop him is to find the dragon warrior. Panda who never do any sport loves kung fu. The old master defended the place for many years is trying to find the dragon. Panda chosen as a dragon warrior have to defend the place this time.
