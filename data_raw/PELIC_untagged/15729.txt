My family is big and has many members. I have three aunts two uncles and three brothers. However the most interesting is my uncle Aziz. I love my uncle so much because he is very kind smart and he is a hard worker. Aziz is the oldest member of my family. Although he is eldrly man now he is in good health condition. He has a short and white mustache and grey beard. Under his boald he has a wrinkiled forehead and brown eyes. Aziz is short and skinny and he wears the traditional clothes. On his right forearm he has an old scar caused by knife stab. Uncle Aziz has an amazing history. He had a hard time. He was born in a poor village in the desert. He could continue his education because he had to work and help his family. When he was eighteen he left home to work as a truck driver. He faced a lot of proplems in his life but he overcame them. Lastly he became a successful business man. I love spending time with my uncle Aziz because he is wise and has a wide experince in the life. I like his advices because he teaches me how to be patient and work hard.
