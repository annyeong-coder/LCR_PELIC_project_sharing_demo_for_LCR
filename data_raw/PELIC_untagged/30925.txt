On Halloween she was holding a leather harness like the kind used for seeing eye dogs. The woman Ann Edie was simply blind and out with her panda guide. At one point panda paused waited for a car pass then walked into the road. Edie isn't the only blind person who uses a guide horse instead of a dog. In that time a blind person typically has five to seven guide dogs. It can cost up to 60 000 to breed. Panda is almost eight years old and her trainer is Alexandra Kurland they're still improving their communication. Edie has nothing against service dogs she has had several one of them worked beautifully. She still says I would never sat to blind person run out and get horse guide because they eat more often than dogs. Plus they can't lie down in small places because they don't fit in standard coach. Some people enjoy running into an occasional primate or farm animal while shopping.
