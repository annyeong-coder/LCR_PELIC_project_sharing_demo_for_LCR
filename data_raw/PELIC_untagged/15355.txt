In the listening class I learnde about Japanese tea ceremony. They called Chado . Japanese classmate explained Chado . Chado has many steps and they need many kinds stuff and technique. When I heard I thought that is cultured and quaint Japanese style tea ceremony. One interesting thing is korean and chinese also have traditional tea ceremony and we called the same the japanese tea ceremony chado .
