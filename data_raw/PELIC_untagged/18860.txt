It was July 1997 before I had graduated my college made me practice physical therapy in hospital as completed the requirements for obtaining the Bachelor PT. At the first I was ashamed of making mistakes but my clinical supervisor doctor Mohssan had me trust myself. Actual he had an appropriate method which helps me avoid making a wrong way when I treated the patients. For example he started with me from simple cases to complication cases. After more practice he got me to take cases and diagnose them individual and then we discussed the situation of patients who I diagnosed. At the end he let me to attend surgical operation and make physical therapy to patients who are in the ICU .
