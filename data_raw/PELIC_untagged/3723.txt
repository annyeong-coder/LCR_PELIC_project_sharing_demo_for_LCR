I think it's better for her not to marry David. She is OUGHT TO HAVE thought a lot because she will stick with him for along time. Also she COULDN'T HAVE called off the wedding until she's certain. However if she pretty sure about James she COULD HAVE talked to him about her feelings. In fact James had shared with her many hobbies and interests. So she SHOULD trust her heart.
