Famine is one of the social problems especially in the poor countries. I think that need to put at the priority issues on the discussion table. They need to focus on that problem to find solution or find supporting the existing works. I suggest trying to stop the wars which are the primary reason for famine. So we should help to find the peace between the all sides fighting. Second issue I recommend increasing the UN's budget for that and plan to reduce politic benefit which is against the peace. We should fast volunteer about providing the helping food stuff. One think I want to add it here is we should care for learning our children the different between what the politic want and what is happening to the people.
