I always remember that day a day when a new movie hit the screens and asked my friend that we have to go to that movie because I believed that it was one of those movies that you will remember and enjoy watching. I asked my friends to hangout and watch the movie and their answers was different form agree and non agree. I remember when m friend Aziz said If we got to the movie then we must stop for food . So I had no choice rather than agreeing with him. But my other friend asked if the movie is a thriller because he is obviously scared. So finally we went to the movie and it wasn't good at all so my friends said that I would never ever pick a movie to watch and until this day I never ever picked movie to watch.
