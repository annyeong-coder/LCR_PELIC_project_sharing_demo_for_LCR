I think the clothes people wear reveal something about their personality and character. Because most people have a tendency to express their feeling or emotion or through their appearances. Clothes are most typical things of someone's appearance. In my opinion personality is made by gathering hundreds feelings and emotions. So I think the clothes can show someone's personality.
