The article claims that smell plays a part in how people choose their mates and this is to ensure that any children born as a result of their union will inherit two different immune types for supporting their defenses systems. It seems to be convincing at first glance. But actually the statement had many fallacies and it cannot withstand scrutiny. I will point the fallacies out and provide my reasons in the following. The first fallacy in the article is that there are no samples or numbers to prove this phenomenon. It is a kind of Insufficient Sampling Fallacy. The more accurate the statistic data are the more exact the analyses are. In my opinion survey is a more accurate way to prove the credibility of both linking. The article state that the research made by Prof. Jacob has shown women prefer male orders that are different from their own genetic makeup. Maybe it indeed is effective in some range of age. However here is a Faulty Analogy Fallacy. The background conditions of choosing their perfect partners at different circumstances are assumed without evidence the same. Besides the ordor type which is the body's own defense mechanism and choosing soul mate may be just an innocent coincidence. Improving children's defense system may have nothing to do with choosing perfect mate. There is no direct evidence showing the relation between ordor type and choosing soul mate through this article. It too assertive to say that different ordor type caused choosing soul mate. Succinctly put the conclusion that finding a soul mate is not the way he or she smells. Adopting the phenomenon without deliberation can exacerbate the current problem instead mollify it. As a matter of fact the more sufficient researches were made the more excellent solutions be made. If it jumped rashly to the conclusions the situation may be from bad to worse.
