My primary school teacher was a big help to me change when I was a teenager. I made many trouble like a naughty boy in my class. But she didn't angry and she didn't make me feel stupid. I was surprised because all the teachers were angry and they made me feel stupid before I met this teacher. She got me to try new thing. For example she made me grow vegetables in school's garden she had me read books etc. Also she let me study text. So I liked to study in school. I could get good grade and good personality. So I never forgot this teacher.
