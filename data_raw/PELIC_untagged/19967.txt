My hometown Daegu is the fourth largest city in South Korea after Seoul Busan and Incheon. Actually Daegu is not my hometown. However I always have thought that this city is my real hometown because I have a lot of friends and wonderful memories in Daegu. Now I have been stayed here in Pittsburgh and have found several common things and differences between my hometown and Pittsburgh. Even thought I can overcome homesickness forward my hometown due to common things several differences make me prefer to live in Daegu. To state the main differences three things can be said climate transportation and food between Daegu and Pittsburgh. First of all geologically Daegu sits in a basin surrounded by low mountains. This geological feature make Daegu trap hot and humid air in summer. Similarly in winter cold air lies in the basin. Therefore Daegu has a humid subtropical climate. Pittsburgh is also surrounded by a lot of mountains and has three rivers which are Allegheny river Monongahela river and Ohio river. Also most of people think that Pittsburgh is a humid subtropical zone because Pittsburgh lies at the northern tip of a humid subtropical zone. Although Both of two cities has same humid subtropical climate winter of Pittsburgh is much longer colder and snowier than that of Daegu. Another difference is that Pittsburgh has much shorter spring and fall than those of Daegu. In person because I dislike not only cold weather but also short spring and winter these differences make me miss the climate of Daegu.
