From my perspectives as a medical student I acknowledge that good understanding of medicine requires a comprehensive understanding of English since many textbooks have been written in English. In addition my plans is to pursue a job in the US for a while after I will finish my residency program so having a good understanding of English will maximize my communication ability with the patients. Lastly I want to reinforce my English language that I studied in my country. So learning an English language will transform my life towards productivity that is my I have chosen English as my destiny
