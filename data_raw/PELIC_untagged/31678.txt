In my country food is definitely better than here in the U. S. The reason is that the food in my country is cooked with natural ingredients and is most of the time homemade. So it's fresher and healthier than in the U. S. Food in my country is less expensive too. Food in my country is also spicier than in the U. S. My real problem with the American food is the sugar. They add too much sugar in their meals so the food becomes sweeter than food in my country. But American food taste as good as food in my country it's just a matter of habit and details. At least Americans put interest in food as much as in my country.
