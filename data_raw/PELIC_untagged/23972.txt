Yesterday I had an opportunity to speak with a native speaker. Actually it was an interesting conversation. I listened to her opinion about friend and buddy. She believed that a friend can be someone who tells you confidential things and trust you to know things about him or her Also you are comfortable and being with him or her anywhere. On the other hand buddy is someone that is a more casual acquaintance than a friend and whose time is a lot with you. Sharing a lot of things with him or her such as conversation and dinner but not necessary as affection as friend but you still very enjoyable.
