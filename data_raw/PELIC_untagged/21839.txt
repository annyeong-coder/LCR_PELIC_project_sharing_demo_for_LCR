No it isn't. In my country we have a tradition of lunch or dinner at home with family and we eat a lot off salads rice black beans grilled fish or steak or salmon or chicken. We didn't make snacks at lunch or dinner We always make meals. We eat fast food like pizza hamburguer french fries and etc only on weekends.
