Three months ago I made the decision of doing another semester in The ELI and I wish I had paid attention to what my inner voice was telling me. If I had known how things were going to turn out I wouldn't have done another semester. Unfortunately those kinds of things happen. Well this is my anecdote. My government demanded me to fill some forms out because I needed to prove the reason why I needed dollars. Therefore I filled out these forms in August. If I had filled them out in July I hadn't waited a long time to get the money. However I wanted to be at Venezuela and be sure that all my requirements were complete. At first I felt that I needed something else but I followed all steps that the bank gave me and I didn't follow my intuition. I wish I have checked the entire requirement on Internet before sending them. After that the government sent me a notification that I needed to stamp my files in New York's embassy. If had sent this requirement the government would have approved my requisition immediately. In addition the government and the bank have been sending a lot of notification to ask me to fill out more and more forms. I really wish this procedure would finish.
