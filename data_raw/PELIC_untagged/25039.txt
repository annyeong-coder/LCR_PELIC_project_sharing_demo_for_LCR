An ideal parent who support their children and teach them the good things. Also a parent who is spoiling their children too much indeed they are destroy them so they will not be strong enough to deal with the real life. In addition the parents who are close to their children are real parents so the children will consider them like their best friends. The parents who encourage their children to continue their education is whom I respect. So the children whose have a good education will be proud of themselves and their family. The parents who can afford the food and money to rise their children are the parents who want to live with them.
