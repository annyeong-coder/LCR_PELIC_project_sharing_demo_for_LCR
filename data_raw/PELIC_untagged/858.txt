People have been living in the earth for thousands of years but human activities influence the earth. Some people believe that earth is being harmed by human activities. Others feel that human activities make the earth a better place to live. In my opinion the earth is being damaged by human activities my argument or this point is listed as follows. Human activities have damaged natural environment and almost exhausted natural resources. Modern industry needs more and more resources including minerals fuels and water. So we confront of the serious problems such as the lack of fuels and water. In addition those activities effect some animals and plants and the places where they live in. More and more building are constructed and forests become less and less. If we cannot recognize those problems and solve them soon we would finally lose the environment suitable for our living. Another serious problem is that human activities decreases forests and increases the usage of fuels so that the gas of carbon is output more and more and there are not enough plants to absorb it. The green house is more obvious and more sensible this year. I am worried about the cities nearby the sea and I hope scientist find an effective to eliminate the green house effect. Although we have advanced machines and our life seems comfortable than before we have less chances approach natures and less spaces to act. The cities become bigger and if we want to have a picnic with our friends we have to drive long distance to find a natural place especially in my country. In fact the spaces of human activity are being damaged by the skyscrapers and factories. From the above statements we can conclude that human activity brings the earth many damages. Fortunately people have recognized the point and I believe that the earth will become a better place to live with our ceaseless efforts.
