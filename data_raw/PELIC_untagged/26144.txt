Sitting on the coach and thinking about my future I star to think in how my goals has been changed in these years. Before my graduation as a medical doctor in Colombia I thought that my primary goal was be a pediatrician as soon as possible so I did my social service in a rural area in a little town of Colombia because in that town I needed only six months to complete my social service because was a red zone which means a zone with conflicts with the guerrilla. So I did everything that was possible to obtain that spot. If I had that chance today I think I'll hesitate a million times! Anyway I did that social service and it was terrible I cried I think almost every day because I was alone without friends with some bad coworkers and the most bad part of my story is that I needed to do autopsies if had any dead in the town. In all my medical school there is not a thing that I can hate more than autopsies so with my bad luck I did a lot in that town. Growing up as a person and I start to think that I wanted and I needed my family and I realized that Gabriel was very important for me so I took a break after that terrible six months and I changed my mind so I decide to took my life more easy and I left my hurry back my husband came to us and we got married and now here I'm Having been moved to Pittsburgh my goals changed again a little bit. I want to learn and speak English very well but sometimes I feel comfortable and sometimes I feel terrible. After finishing my English course I want to start and complete my mph in genetics and I want to go back to Colombia and start Pediatrics I also want have a happy family with my husband and I want to see my kids in the future maybe in 4 years not now playing with their grandmothers and grandfathers now I don't want to be the best neonatologist in my country I want to be a happy Pediatrician with some fellow that I don't know now with my entire family in my country traveling around the world sharing some Sundays with our parents dancing Latin American music eating Colombian and international food in Bogota have a Labrador but everything with my lovely husband who I love a lot in my lovely country which for me is the best country in the world
