In this semester at ELI I learned very interesting things. Especially I liked core vocabularies. The vocabulary is very important aspect when we study English because if I don't know words I can't talk and read. When I came the US I didn't know enough vocabularies however now I know many them. Since I started to study at ELI I have acquired a lot words. It's obvious I can read books easier than before. Why do I like this aspect This is the reason that I had to use those words at each class therefore I could remember naturally. In addition I have been preparing for TOEFL those words are very useful to answer questions. I haven't take TOEFL but in the future I will take it thus I might demonstrate my skill before I learned. Those reasons I think the most important thing is core vocabularies.
