Elder people in Britain are crying for help due to the cruelty of their children. Older people in Britain are living in houses which are filled by other older people. When a person reaches the end of his life he dies trying to enjoy each and last moment of his life. They try to be close with their grand children and try to make influence in their life because this the only way that they are going to be remembered. Each one of us should take care of his her old man women. Our parents spent their whole life sacrificing and dedicating their life to make ours just better. I think that the right time to pay them back is when the most need us when they get older. A lot of people don't realize what their parents did for them. Yes houses filled with older people and good health service would be better environment for them but is that what they really want is that what they really asked for. Of course not what they really want is to be surrounded by their children that they spent their whole life rising to see their grand children. Everyone wants to spend the rest of his life surrounded with his family and beloved people. If you think that paying for houses with older people and better health care you could higher nurse that can take care of you old man women. I think that older people are the torch that leads us to brighter future. So we should take good care of them and let them rest in peace. We should make their last wishes come true.
