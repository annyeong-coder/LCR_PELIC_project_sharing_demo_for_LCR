Two years ago I wanted to buy stocks instead of paying an installment deposit but I didn't. Because at that time business conditions were very bad so it could be risky. Even though my intuition was telling me that was the time to buy stocks I followed a safe way. But at this point I wish I had paid attention to what my intuition was telling me. I would have gotten more money if I had bought stocks. If I had bought some stocks I would have earned at least twenty times more money. If only I had followed my intuition. If I have one more chance I will follow my intuition.
