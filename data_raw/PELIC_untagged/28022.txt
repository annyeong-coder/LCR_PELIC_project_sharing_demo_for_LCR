I believe that an acquaintance is someone who just greets you. Some might believe that he is the one who only makes conversations with you. However a friend is a person who hangs out with you and has fun with you. He is the person who spends a lot of time with you. I think you would agree with me that your best friend is someone who is trustworthy. He is the one who will help you at hard times and who also shares his happiness with you.
