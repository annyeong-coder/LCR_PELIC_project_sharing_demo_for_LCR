Last year I went to Washington DC with my family. My wife had one week time for this travel so we had enough time. The first bay we decided to visit some museums. There were many museums in Washington DC. In the National Air and Space Museum we spent too much time. Because there were a lot of things that we were very interested. All day we had visited only two museums. Next day we prepared some food and a little drink so we were quick more than first day. We spent five days on this travel and had a good vacation.
