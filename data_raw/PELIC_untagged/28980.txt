I'd want to take four goods to adesert island. They are matches a solar powered computer a knife and DORAEMON which is asuper robot. Matches can make us warm and we can make something using them. We should take a solar powred computer because we can get some information using it or we are able to contact someone. We ought to take a knife too. We may get some animals for eating using it. We have to take DORAEMON because he is a super robot. If we take him we might not feel inconvinient even in the desert island.
