Although there are many famous and important persons in the world I admire and keep an eye on Noriko Maeda who is the owner of Noriko Maeda Boutiques. I had known her on magazines before she became popular and famous. At that time she owned only two or three shops in Kansai and Thokai area Japan but now she has not only a building in Tokyo Japan but also a shop in New York the U. S. The building in Tokyo is assumed to be pretty expensive because it is located in the most expensive area of Japan. She published two books which mentioned how her business had become big so nowadays she is very famous in Japan. She is regarded as one of the most successful women in Japan. She is considered a very energetic person. It is said that when she is taken a picture with people she is usually surrounded. According to her books she is felt to believe Feng Shui.
