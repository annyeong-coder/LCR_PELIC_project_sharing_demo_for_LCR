Before cell phones people used various methods to communicate. From communicating through smoke signals to cell phones humanity did really important job. The process which was done by people is the most significant evaluation during the history of humanity. At the early times of humanity people did not have the technology. However they had to access each other. So they used for these whatever they do. According to historian they used the pigeons to send message pipes for sound messages fume for signals for a tribe to another one. Living at those ages was not convenient as far as I'm concerned. Technology brings needed and effective tools every time. In my opinion for our era the most important tool is cell phones. If I am forced to live without cell phone I can honestly say that I feel myself like I am troubled. As you can see every different civilization manages their communication system depending upon their development level.
