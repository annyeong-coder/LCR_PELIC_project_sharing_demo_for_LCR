Do unusual names make kids' lives harder Absolutely I think the kids whose names are unusual live harder. There are several reasons supporting my opinion the kid whose name is strange is laughed by his classmates and usually is forgotten his name. First of all when children are very young their names are important for them. Because when they are in the school their friends affect them more than their parents. Moreover if they have strange names they could be treated by their classmates and they must have a unhappy memories when they grow up. Therefore the children's names are very important effects for them. What's more if the kids' have unusual names their friends always forget what the names are. It bothers them when people can not call their names because it means the children who have strange names make friends more difficult than others. For example my friend's son's name is Cutteluya and when people meet him first time no one can remember his name. When people can not call the name how they can make friends with him. Some people think the kid's name should be unique because every one can be identified easier. I do believe that people who have unique names are easy to know. However if it is just easy to identify it doesn't mean it is easy to live.
