When I was a child my mother and I went to my mother fried's house. That lady was from different culture of ours. Some times the difference made us made some mistakes. First of all we took our shoes off in front of the door. We should not have done that. We should have entered the hose with them. Then we brought a gift with us. It was a toy for her son. I think we should not have brought that for the first time visiting. We might have brought some flowers for the fist time. Finally we ate the whole food in our plates but we did not have to do that because in their culture if the guests eat every thing in the dishes that means they need more.
