Venezuela is located in North America above Brazil and besides Colombia. It is surrounded by the Pacific and the Caribbean Oceans. It's a wonderful country with exciting sceneries. You can find mountains desserts the Amazonia jungle plains and some of the best beaches in the world complemented with and impressive diversity of fauna and flora. It is a shame that governors have not appreciated the potential of the land and people they rule. They been concentrating in their own causes and their eyes have been shadowed by corruptions and personal wealth. They don't understand the damage they are inflicting in ecosystems and people. I hope they realize before they cause grater damage so that Venezuelan could preserve their real natural treasures and beauties.
