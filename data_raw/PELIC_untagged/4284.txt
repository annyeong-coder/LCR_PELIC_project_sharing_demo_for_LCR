I believe that the best teacher I ever had in my country is my manager in my company. First of all he made me be professional. For example he let me get a lot of opportunities to attend various conferences which helped me broaden my human networks. In addition he got me to do research about my field and the research had me know about new issues or technologies. That is he always encouraged me to work. That's why I consider my manager is the best teacher.
