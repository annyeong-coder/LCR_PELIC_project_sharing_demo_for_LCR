I like to do many thing at home. I am very organized persone. For example If I take a mug to drink some tea . After I drink up the tea I clean it up and bring it back to the basket. It bothers me when I go to clean my clothes in the basment because most of washers break down. I went to the building administration to talk over the washer problem. Unfurtunately we still have the problem They turend me down. What I would like the administration do two things. First they pick up new washers. Second they should touch up the building.
