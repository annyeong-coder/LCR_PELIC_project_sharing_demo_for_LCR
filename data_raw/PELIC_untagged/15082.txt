When I was in the college on the first day. I was walking in the hall while person was walking and he was holding big box on his hand. He interrupted on the hall with a stone and the box fell on the floor and the papers spreaded. Then I came to him helping him to collect the papers. After that I helped him to take the papers to his office. Next I went to my lecture but the professor didn't come yet. While I was sitting in the class the professor came to the class. Suddenly he was that person I helped him. After that we were a good friends.
