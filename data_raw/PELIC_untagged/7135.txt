Topic There are some things affect what I buy. There are some things affect what I buy. First of all sometimes I go shopping with my friends or girlfriends. I will led by the nose with an advertisement during shopping. Also they always have a discount from an advertisement. And I will buy more things back to my home. Finally I can't buy the thing which I want. Second once when I went to computer store I wanted to buy a mouse. Then I already knew which one I wanted to buy. Then I saw the other one was more practical. Finally I bought the other one. Third if something is sold like hotcakes I also will go to buy it. Although I know this is not good for me but I am enticed by those things. I think sometimes I buy something which is a fake but I still buy it. Fourth when I go to the market I think the music in the market also will convent my mood and let me buy more or less. Finally I want to give you some tips if something world of mouth or catches on that doesn't mean it's really good and useful. Don't just go to buy it and waste your money.
