Assessment of My First Holidays in the USA I have several exciting memories about my first holidays in the United States. Since I came at Pittsburgh I had initally holiday that is memorial day. Actually I have never spend a lot of time to enjoy looking around Pittsburgh. However I could have a good time during last three days such as going shopping hving a trial ride and going to amusement park. One day we went to a Kia car center to buy a new car with our acquaintances I could see many fantastic cars that I want to buy. I firstly saw various new cars directly as well as enjoyed a good test drive. Right after we went to shopping to buy some clothes at Waterfront. I looked around many clothes and then I bought a short pant that is orange color. On our second day we went to Kennywood around Waterfront. At first it seemed like a smaller amusement park than others. However when I actually entered there I could see a lot of adventure rides such as biking zirodrop and so on. Even though we waited to ride a biking for a long time we felt satisfied as much as waiting. I would like to go to Kennywood frequently. On third day we spent our free time talking about our American life and a few goals that we hace to achieve in 5 years. We currently are adapting ourself to Pittsburgh's life. This city is a good place to live than I expected. It has a beautiful nature and convenient transportation especially I feel safer than other cities. During my first holidays I had very fantastic experiences with my husbund. As for me the three days deserve permanent remembrance.
