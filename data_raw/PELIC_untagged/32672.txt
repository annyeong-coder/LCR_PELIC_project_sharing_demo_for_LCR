Both passage The Small House Movement and Twenty Four Rooms in One cover the same general topic about little spaces for living. The passages show the benefits of small spaces and give true stories about people who have used small spaces in their living. Moreover Both reading passages have same length. On the other hand the reading passages have different focus to approach the topics. While The Small House Movement gives more than one example of different people Twenty Four Rooms in One goes in deep one person experience. First story uses a wide scope but the second one uses a narrow scope. Obviously that first passage interviews 4 people and the other passage interviews just one person. Although both stories have positive attitude toward the topic the second one was not obvious like the first one.
