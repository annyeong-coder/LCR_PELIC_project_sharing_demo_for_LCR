We have some original rules when we eat a Japanese meal. If you don't observe the rules we are annoyed. For example when we eat a rice bowl or a soup bowl we must lift up the bowl. If you eat it putting on the table we are annoyed and sometimes you are warned. We say Itadakimasu when we start a meal and we say Gochisosama when we finish a meal. We express to thank for people who related to the meal that way. I think it is a kind of ethical rules.
