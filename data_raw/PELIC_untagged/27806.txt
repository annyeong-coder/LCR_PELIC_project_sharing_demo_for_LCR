Animals at Jones' farm meet secretly every day after Mr. Jones goes to bed. In a barn Old Major a wise and old pig encourages animals to unite in fighting human beings who exploit the animals. After Major is dead the animals finally rebel against Mr. Jones and his workers who abandon the animals. The animals manage Jones Farm by themselves and change the farm's name to Animal Farm . They are very happy and proud of themselves. Under the direction of smart pigs they make 7 commands to develop an egalitarian animal society. They begin to learn to read and write English and make decision in regular conference on every Sunday. Over time however pig leaders Napoleon and Snowball begin to be antagonistic and they fight against each other to seize power. Napoleon expels Snowball and forces the animals to build windmill to generate electricity which was Snowball's plan. Also he takes 9 puppies from their mother right after they are born and raises them as soldiers for him. Animal Farm is not 'Animal's' farm anymore. Pigs enjoy special and secret privileges and amend 7 Commands to justify their interests. Animals think something is wrong but they can't do nothing as being frightened by ferocious 9 dogs and deceived by crafty pigs. Meanwhile a sincere and honest horse Boxer who has worked hard without any complaints collapses due to overwork. Pigs sells him to human. Thanks to windmill which has to be built twice the animal farm can produce more yields but the animals can't benefit from them except for pigs. Pigs live in the Jones' house and give their children a special education. Finally they stand with their foot like their enemy humans and exploit the other animals. The end
