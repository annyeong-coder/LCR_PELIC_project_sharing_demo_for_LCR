I used to go to the gym when I saw a beautiful girl and I talked to her. I introduced her and we started to talk. Next day I invited her to dance at club and she accepted me the invitation. When we went to club I thought that I had to tell her that I liked her so we were dancing when I decided to tell her it her attitude was very positive. By the time I told her that I was falling in love of her and that I would like to be the boyfriend of her and she told me that yes. Finally we were getting married when we were younger. Today we have a beautiful daughter and we love her too much.
