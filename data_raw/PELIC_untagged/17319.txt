When I came here I felt uncomfortable. At that time I didn't have house. So I had lived in hotel until I found new apartment. When I stayed in hotel I had to eat American food . It made my stomach sick. Because I wasn't familiar to American food. I wished I could have found new place as soon as possible. When I looked for new apartment I couldn't speak English well. Because I had never learned how to speak English in Korea. I have learned English listening reading and writing since I was a middle school student except speaking. That was a big problem. Also I was very shy when I spoke English. However I have tried to speak English confidently since I came here.
