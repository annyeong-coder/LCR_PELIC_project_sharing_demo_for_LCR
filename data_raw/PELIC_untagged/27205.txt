I am going to live alone on a deserted land . I think I should take a lot of things with me. I need a lot of matches for making a fire. Also I need a compass to show me the direction where I travelling in. The most important thing I should take enough fresh water I might not find any water source there. And for energy I must eat something to be a live so I think I should take some beans and a cooking pot for cooking food.
