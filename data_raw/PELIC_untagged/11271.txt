After reading the article I decided to analyze my personalities to know what type of person that I am. First of all I considered myself as an introvert because I'm the kind of person who don't know how to deal with strangers and don't like to talk. When I first meet someone I don't talk much unless he she is the person whom I feel comfortable with. Secondly I'm a sensor. I like to look around to find something that I familiar with when I'm in a new place. Furthermore I'm a feeler. When I buy something it always depends on my mood and feeling then I can decide which to buy and which are not. Study also I cannot study when I have no study mood which depends on the place where I study. Finally I'm a perceiver whose plan is flexible. Before I tried to plan things however there usually something screwed up my plan which really annoyed me. Since that I don't like to plan anymore. My time becomes much more flexible.
