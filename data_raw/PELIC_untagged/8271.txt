My worst meal ever! Or maybe the best! Wine candlelight full Moon Latin dancing the best boyfriend in the world! This is a perfect setting for a beautiful and romantic night. There are plans for a great dinner prepared by me. I am planning to show off my cooking skills to my boyfriend. I had planned to cook a risotto with vegetables and a grilled beef to be wash down with Caipirinhas the typical Brazilian mixed drink. Ah a night to dream or to have nightmares about! First I overestimated the rice cooking time and water. This is not a good mix it results in a pasty dish more suitable to glue wallpaper than to eat. It tastes just as good as it sounds also. The meat was good especially to my two cats that found it irresistible enough to start eating it in front of my boyfriend. Thanks God for his sense of humor! Did I mention that it is hard to get sticky risotto off the pot Never mind it may as well be impossible. The thing tastes worst than it looks if you can believe it. The meat well we did not even go there after the cats had first share! Caipirinhas saved the night! Limejuice sugar and sugar cane liquor thanks God for the latter they were what I needed! My boyfriend is still my boyfriend and future husband . He still thinks the dinner was a joke!
