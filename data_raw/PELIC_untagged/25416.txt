Before I came to U. S I had taken korea SAT twice. It was a terrible memory for me. When I first took the SAT I was very confident in myself. I got much high score than I expected. So I applied for the high level university. Nevertheless I failed. I had tried again and I got in my university. After I went to Army. Every Korean have to go to Armt service. I had been in army service for 2 years. When I had finished the Army service I realized I have to study hard because I had seen much educated people in Army. To catch them I have to change the university or I have to study hard to be best in my major. I chose studying hard. Before I decided to come to U. S I had studied very hard and I became top in grades.
