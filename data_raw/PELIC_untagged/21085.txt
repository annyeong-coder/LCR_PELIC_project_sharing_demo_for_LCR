Actually studying language is a trial for me the gap which between the languages is implicit. Before I came to U. S. I can buy anything easily in my country but it's hard for me to order a meal in MacDonald at beginning. It's so embarrassed and sometimes I doubt that why I'm here. However I persist to practice my English for surviving even though I felt depressed when they can't understand what I said I believe I can do better next time. Even I have been here for 7 months I figure out my English is not good enough. I love to study new things and I retain this attitude in my English studying I keep this belief and expect I can still improve my English.
