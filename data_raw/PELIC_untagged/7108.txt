There is a good proverb The Best Mirror is an Old Friends in the world. Actually I have three best friends in my country. All of them have a different character for example a friend who is MinWook Kim is very funny guy and easygoing person another friend who is JiYong ANON_NAME_0 is very haggard person and last friend who is SungDu Moon is very silent person. Although we have a different character we've been helping each other and always are in the same boat every time. Actually we had to go different university but we had tried to meet each other so I'm in touch with them. When we met we probably go to the pool which is Korean style pool. Fortunately we've already known someone whose host in the pool center so we can play very cheap price.
