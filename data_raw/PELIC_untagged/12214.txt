I have always been able to go to the place where I want. When I want to go to somewhere I just imagine that place and close my eyes. When I open my eyes I am there where I wanted. In fact I hadn't had this ability when I was a child. I have had this ability since I was a student in middle school. One day I was in my home and I really didn't want to go to school. I closed my eyes and imagined my school. I thought How would it be wonderful if I were in school without walking Suddenly when I opened my eyes I was sitting on my chair. I was so surprised it had never happened before. I have been so happy since then because I have been able to go anywhere. However I can go the place where I have been already.
