Welcome everybody! I'm ANON_NAME_0 Last Name your brand new fellow traveler. I've spent all my life in Madrid Spain but I've been living in Pittsburgh since last January. I love traveling. I grew up dreaming about all the places I would visit and now is the moment. Until now I've been in 14 diffents country and since a few years ago I've been thinking about building a website where share opinions advices impressions or whatever you think could be important to know about a place. During each trip that I've made I realized that is much better when you go with somebody who has lived there so natives around the World join each other! I've been waiting so long to meet you guys but I now I think the wait was worth.
