Today There are many fast food restaurants in the world. It means many people are using fast food restaurant. I think that the fast food restaurants has two effects good effect and bad effect. Fast food restaurants are really convinient. We can eat cheaply and faster. When we are in harry or want to save money fast food will help us. However fast food restaurants are not good for the health. They are too oily and salty. They are used bad oil. I have read a book which is about fast food before. In this book a man made an experiment. He had kept eating only fast food for three month and check the changes which are happend to his health. As a result his weight increased rapidly. He became easy to catch a cold and always felt tired. After he kept eating two month it effects to his eyes. He could not watch clearly. Then he stopped the experiment. He thought that it was too dangerous to contenue. I think whethr eat fast food or not is our choise. Some fast foods are getting healther.
