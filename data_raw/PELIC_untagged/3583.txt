It is good time to hear the fantasy music from the sound of raindrops by sitting at home as Eui Hyun noted and it is true the rain makes the sky so beautiful ANON_NAME_0 said. However I still don't like the raining. Why First before raining the weather is always gloomy and humility that make people don't like as Kaley mentioned. Then the raining always makes our clothes to get wet or us feel cold so I also don't want to go out when it rains as ANON_NAME_1 told. In addition in my country the air pollution becomes serious problems. When it is raining using an umbrella to avoid the raindrops is very important there. Because the raining can carry the pollution down it causes some illness for example losing hair or getting skin problems. Even though I know the raining is indispensable for nature agriculture irrigation and human's life I still don't like the rain
