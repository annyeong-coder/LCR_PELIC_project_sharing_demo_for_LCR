Chinese New Year In China people celebrate the spring every year. We call it Chinese Lunar New Year. In this holiday people gather their family to celebrate the Lunar New Year's coming. There are three important things that must be done preparations family reunion dinners and celebration in temples. In order to get ready people first buy a great many flowers such as chrysanthemum peach blossom narcissus and kumquat. Different flowers have different meanings. For example kumquat means good fortune. Next people buy fruits and candy. Then people clean their homes. Finally people decorate their homes with flowers and in red. Beside the preparations family reunion dinners also play an important role to Chinese people in New Year's Eve. On this day people who work in other localities all year round also go home to celebrate and have family reunion dinners. At first people cook lots of food early in the morning. Then they set the food on altars as offerings to their ancestors. Eventually people get together to have family reunion dinner. After dinner some people go to temples immediately because they believe the first one to set incense will bring himself the most of the blessings. However most of the people prefer going to temples on the first day of New Year. First of all they prepare food at home and bring it to temples. Then they buy incense for Buddha hoping they will get blessings from him. After going to temples people share food with their families. In the end people visit their relatives and friends in the rest of the holiday. The Chinese New Year is made of three parts. Preparations are the most time consuming for housewives. Family dinners are always an essential part. A visit to the temple concludes the Chinese New Year. In this holiday people thanks for the past and look forward to the future.
