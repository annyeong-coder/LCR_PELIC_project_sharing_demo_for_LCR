When I waked up this morning I came up with an idea about inviting my friends over on the weekend. I called my friends to inform them. Mark found out he has a lot of hoework to do while Emma wants to go over her assignments. Semon accepted my invitation at the begining but he called me back to excuse himself because he wants to drop by his mother's house. So I ended up staying alone in my home.
