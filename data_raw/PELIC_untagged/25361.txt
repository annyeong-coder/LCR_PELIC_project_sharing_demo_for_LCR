I have always been sports fan. I interesting in play basketball running and billiards. I have been studying in ELI for a couple of monthes but I still take time out to play. I have played basketball since I moved to Pittsburgh but those guys were stronger than me because university of pittsburgh was famous for basketball. Sometimes I can play billiards with my friend. Last month I have already played once in CMU. And I have been running in my part of free time.
