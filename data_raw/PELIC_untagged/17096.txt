We decied to take a compass the maps the fishing equip an ax and some fresh water. The first if we lost our direction we could use a compass and the maps. They could direct the right ways. And a compass could help us to find the North Star. Then if we don't have any food the fishing equip is important. We can catch some food by ourselves. Next we could make a new float with an ax. Most importantly we need enough fresh water. If we don't have enough fresh water we will die.
