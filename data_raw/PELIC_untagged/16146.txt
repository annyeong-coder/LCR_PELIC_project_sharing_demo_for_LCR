I graduated from King ANON_NAME_0 University of Petroleum and Minerals last year. I studied English in the first year at the university. It was a one year program that prepare us for engineering schools. I was a young collage boy looking for fun. I didn't study hard that year. I should have worked harder in that program to improve my English skills. At the end of that year I finished that program and entered the software engineering school. My English skills were not that good at that time. I found it very difficult to do well in exams. The only reason was that the exams were in English and it was difficult for me to answer the questions. Although I knew the answers the problem was in how to write them. I could have done better in exams if I had studied harder in that program. I remember that I had to work very hard to improve my English skills and to study for other courses. Although I've got a good grade point average I believe that I might have gotten better if I had worked harder.
