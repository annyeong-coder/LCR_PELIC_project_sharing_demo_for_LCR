Dear Fed up with dog poop I understand your situation. It is annoying that your neighbor's dog poop in your yard. I suggest that you talk to your neighbor directly. It is required that people clean up after their dogs. Also it is important that you communicate with your neighbor. If you talk to her politely she will not be offended at all. I am sure that she will understand. At last if I had been you I would have asked her out already. So be brave! Good luck! Ms. Manners
