On February 20 2012 I created a time capsule. I buried it under the tree that is in front of my house. The capsule contains 6 items. Each item tells something about the life I live these days. For example I put some pictures that describe my city's buildings and streets to show you the place where I live. Also there are a few coins and some dollars that I use. In addition several devices are put such as a Cell phone an I Pad and a CD player. Also I put many music CDs that I am used to listening in 2012. Some fabrics are put in the capsule. Furthermore many newspaper and magazines are also inside the capsule.
