I met my teacher a GRE teacher when he was teaching a GRE class. We were not real friends because we did not have any personal conversations. Even though the relationship was not so close he not only inspired me to study English but he also encouraged me to persist in pursuing my dream. He also taught me how to make my thoughts more rational. This kind of skill helped me organize my thoughts in a reasonable and clearer way. I appreciated learning not only Englush but also other valuable knowledge from him.
