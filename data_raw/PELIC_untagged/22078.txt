A woman Dian Fossey participates in a speech of an anthropologist who is strongly arguing that we need to save some primates in danger. As she listens to the speech she gets impressed by him and decides to follow him investigating about Gorillas in Africa. When she arrives there she is embarassed a little bit because of the strange and pitiful environment surrounding her but soon she adapts there thanks to a guy who can speak English simply among the tribe living there. However she gets frustrated again because the anthropologist leaves there without her so she should stay alone there. Finally she and a small group including the guy who speaks English a little start a short adventure looking for Gorillas.
