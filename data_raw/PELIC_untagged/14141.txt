I'm not sure whether this story is funny or not. Korea's delivery system is that if people order pizzas or chickens the deliveryman delivers the food to right in front of customers' house. Therefore they do not have to go down to get foods like here. What the story is about is that a boy who order pizza when the elevator was broken. The boy who lives on 20th floor had explained his situation before his order. What the boy wanted do was that he meet the deliveryman at the middle 10th floor. Then the deliveryman accepted that suggestion. That boy ordered pizza was very good at negotiation. Time passed he went down to meet the deliveryman. On his way to went down he saw another deliveryman who was wet with perspiration. And he yelled Fucking kid why he didn't tell me before!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! What's funny about it is that another deliveryman was pitiable.
