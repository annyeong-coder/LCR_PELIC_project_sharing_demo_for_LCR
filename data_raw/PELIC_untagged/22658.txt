In this context the author used a story of Teresa Amabile who is now a specialist in creativity when she was in the kindergarten her interest and creativity of painting was encouraged but when she went to school her creativity was killed by the restricted school. The author uses this story to domenstrate that children's creativity was inhibited by many things in school. Dr. Amalie's research identified some main creativity killers Surveillance Evaluation Rewards Competition Over control Restricting Choice Pressure. Moreover the author thinks that the other great killer of creativity is about time. Sometimes children's desire to work something that they are interested in is frustrated by adults. Children can not do things in their own rhythm. In my opinion I agree that children's creativity is killed by many things in school. When I was high school I was forced to learn math chemistry that I am not interested in. But I had no choice because I need use these to entry a good university because the competition in China is terrible. Actually I am interested in history political and business. I also need to worry about the evaluation of teachers. So my creativity was killed by the school.
