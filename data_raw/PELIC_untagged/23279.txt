Many notable writers can take you to the world you would not imagine before for example JRR Tolkien who created the well known book called The Lord of the Rings . I never experience a kind of book that has its own world before. However couple years ago the director named Peter Jackson has adapted the lord of the rings into movie which has won the OSCAR. Both book and movie are great yet I prefer its novel rather than its movie because of imagination and the story lines. I am going to compare and contrast it below. I myself normally likes to read because I can use my thoughts to make up the characters and the story. Reading the originated Lord of the rings novel is much better than watching the adapted Lord of the rings movie. Sometimes it was an ambiguous to understand what the writer was going to exhibit This was the charming of the novel that you could not experience while you were watching it. Nevertheless in the novel there were minor stories the stories about the minor characters which you could not see in the movie. It enhanced how could you get into the story. This leads to reading its novel can be much more understand the story lines than watching its movie. As a result of reading the novel you would gather more information and easily be connected to the story.
