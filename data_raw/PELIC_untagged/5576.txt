Before I came to Pittsburgh I had never traveled to other country alone. In addition it was a strange experience that I had had a 16 hours flight. I could not have had enough space to stretch out my legs while I was flying When I just arrived at the airport of Pittsburgh I quickly found that I could not even make a phone call because I think that one coin should be sufficient to call my uncle. Before I made a successful connection that night I had been searching the whole lobby to find my baggage and coin exchanging machine for at least an hour. At that night I had felt so frustrate for a while before my uncle picked me up.
