I met my best friend for the first time while we were studying at elementary school. During the breakfast break we were standing in a line to order the breakfast and he asked me where did I pay my boots. Then we talked about many things. After that we were taking our breakfast together. Until this time we always contact each other regularly. As an appreciation for our friendship I named my first son after him Zyad. His family and he always ask about my son.
