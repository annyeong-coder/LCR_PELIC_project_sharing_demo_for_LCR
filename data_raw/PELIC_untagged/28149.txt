A friend is person who helps me every time I need him. I read a book that discusses friends relationships. As result the relationship became weak year by year . I acknowledge their perspective but I would like to list a facts. First a friend is someone who sheers me up when I became upset. Second the fiend who gives me advise can cares about me. Finally the friend whose parents are treat him well counts on him . I disagree with a book that discussed friends relationships because it doesn't tell the truth from people who lives with the experience can give us good result.
