I have been living in Pittsburgh since 2006. I have to do the laundry call my father call my brother study for my boards cut my hair. I haven't done my laundry yet because I don't have detergent and I haven't gone to the supermarket to buy it. I called my father this morning and I talked with him for 2 hours. I haven't called my brother because he is in Turkey and I don't know his phone number. I haven't cut my hair because I don't have money to pay for my haircut. I have been studying for my boards since January. I haven't talked with my girlfriend because I don't have one.
