Numerical Model of Our Reality Descartes who was a great philosopher and mathematician said that the mathematics is the language of the universe. Although many people including scientists and engineers say that the reality is so complex that we will never found a mathematical or numerical solution. All the scientific community uses the same methods to predict and design technical answers to real problems. In the past 30 years there was a boom in the use of computer tools to help technicians engineers designers and scientist in their studies works and research. The use of the computer to solve the real problem and give results that clarify the reality phenomena is named numerical model and is a new scientific methodology. The results are not precise and use several assumption and simplification of our reality but the scientific community is using these results like a reality description. The difference between the reality and the numerical model arise a debate about if we can trust in this results to design structures buildings systems and other critical issues to solve the problems in our world. I think that physical mathematical and numerical model with the experience could give us knowledge of our reality.
