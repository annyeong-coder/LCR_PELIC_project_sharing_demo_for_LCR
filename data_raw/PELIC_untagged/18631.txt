Making tobacco sales illegal In Korean saying tobacco does more harm than good. It is true because tobacco causes several diseases like lung cancer. So when people attend middle school or high school they learn how tobacco is harmful on our body. Although they know the bad effect from tobacco they cannot quit it. Even they start to smoking because they think it looks cool. In case of teenager peer group generates more smokers. The limit that can be controlled by education is over. There are several reasons that the government should make tobacco sales illegal for health for other people's right and for clean and safety. First the most crucial thing of banning tobacco is that it causes some diseases such as lung cancer Buerger's disease and angina pectoris. The death rate of lung cancer is increased steadily every year. Moreover lung cancer has the highest percentage that people are died by cancer. A government has a duty to protect their civil from disease. In other word the government needs to make a law to prohibit people to selling and buying tobacco that can ruin their people. Second smoking violates other people's right. Some people say that banning tobacco infringes upon people's authority but this idea is very selfish. They don't think about other people's right to get fresh air. Even though the government assigned some places for non smokers they don't think it is not enough because the government cannot designate all streets as a smoking banned places.
