And he was trying to pick me up to the airport because an old friend will arrive today. And this is our conversation ANON_NAME_0 Hello ANON_NAME_1 Hello what do you want. I'm really tired. ANON_NAME_0 I wanted to go to the park but I end up taking our old friend from the airport instead. ANON_NAME_1 Hold on Hold on. You woke me up just for this!! I can't believe that. ANON_NAME_0 Think about that over. He was one of our best friend. And he would be sad if he . . . . Actually he went on talking and I was so bored ANON_NAME_1 OK OK I give up. I know that I can't argue with you. ANON_NAME_0 I forget to tell you that I found out a new road. So it takes just 45 minutes to get to the airport. ANON_NAME_1 Great!! I got to go now. ANON_NAME_0 NO No Don't hang up please. Our friend is here because his father died three days ago. ANON_NAME_1 Are you talking seriously !! . . . . . I'll call you back. ANON_NAME_0 OK. Bye Bye ANON_NAME_1 Bye Bye
