My best friend who lives in Osaka west part of Japan is a classmate in my high school. We also went to the same university which located in Tokyo. I think that friends who spend time together in particular situation such a school is special. After graduate the university she moved to Osaka where her company is located we keep in touch each other. It is easy to contact with her than before because we can use an Internet. Even though we are living far away our friendship will be continuing.
