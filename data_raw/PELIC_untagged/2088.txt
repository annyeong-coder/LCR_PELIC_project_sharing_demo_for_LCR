I think paragraph 2 was the most descriptive because the author personified the trees in some different ways. He used many descriptive words and phrases like lowered in supplication so many nuns with their heads bowed in prayer bobbing human heads drunks falling asleep at a bar legions of friendly ghosts nodding off to dreamland and stubby white thumbs. I think those phrases give readers a sense of reality as if they were at the place The reason I chose this section as the most descriptive part is that he used not only simple adjective words but also a lot of metaphor to describe the trees so that readers can understand what they look like and get the details of the trees' appearance. By using metaphor like these phrases the author can deliver the nuance of trees' figure more than by just using simple adjective words. Also by giving a lot of details and explanations readers can relive the experience which the author did saw and felt.
