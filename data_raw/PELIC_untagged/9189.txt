I have friends who delivered a baby in last August alike me. In Kyoto there is a hospital she is working for. Her husband who is a doctor too is working in Kobe so on weekdays they live separately. The apartment which they live together on weekends is in Ashiya. Ashiya is the city which locates midmost of Kyoto and Kobe.
