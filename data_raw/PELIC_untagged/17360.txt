Remodeling our house My husband and I bought a house last year. It was not good condition so that we could not live it without remodeling. We tried out demolishing as much as we could even we had no experience. It was lucky that we had some very kind friends who helped us out sometimes. The first thing we did was doing a search on home remodeling. We listed up remodeling projects coming up with our minds and cross out if it was done. We began with tearing off the wall paper of all the rooms and hall ways. Then we teared down metal kitchen cabinets took off the kitchen counter and a sink and cut out tiles on the floor in the kitchen and the bath room. When our contractors started to join us we were so happy since we were very tired of our projects by that point. They worked very hard and they never let us down. Thanks for their professional jobs we managed to finish our house remodeling. It was a good chance for us to learn how to remodel the house.
