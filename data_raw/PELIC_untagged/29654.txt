A woman was having a bad day after being fired from work and breaking up with her husband. On the other hand the man was having a great day but being late for his son's birthday. Eventually when the woman was feeling that her life couldn't get worse the car in front of her suddenly stopped so she went to the other lane and crashed into the man's car but thanks god nothing happened to either of them the cars took all of the damage. The other woman on the side of the road asked Should I call the police The woman replied Yes please. When the police officers came they asked some questions. The officer with white hair asked the woman if it was her fault. While the man explained to the other officer that it wasn't his fault and he needed to go to his son's birthday. And then the press came and made an interview with the witness. The reporter said that the witness saw the whole accident and it wasn't either of their faults. The fault was on the man that stopped without turning the signal and when he saw the accident he ran away. And at the end the man volunteered to pay for the damages. And they both went home safely.
