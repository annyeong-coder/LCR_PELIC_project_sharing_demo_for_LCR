Before I Go To School I wake up at 9 am in the morning. I brush my teeth and I wash my face to refresh my self. After that I take a shower. Next I make a cup of hot choclate milk and I like it more if it is contain more sugre. After that I eat breakfast like yesterday I made an egg sandwich it was so delicious. Next I take my bag it is a one shoulder bag and I go out to wait the bus to take me to the school.
