The qualities of a good friend Feel comfortable when I'm with them Person who is believable Person who has many common things with me I'd like to talk about the qualities of a good friend. I have three points of a good friend. First of all I think a good friend is a comfortable person to me. When I'm with him or her I'd like to feel comfortable like my family. Even though I'm very sad or tired I can cheer up with my friend. My favorite friends are like a shelter for me whenever I feel bad or lonely. I'm living in the U. S. A. But I call to talk with my lovely friends on the international telephone when I feel sad. Then they give me the relief and encouragement. In addition a good friend who I think is a believable person. Belief is the most important thing between peoples. Of course it is alsp an essential item of the good friend. I don't need a friend who betrays my trust. I've experienced that someone who I believed told everyone about my secret. It's really terrible and I've never met her again. Finally I like a person who has many common things with me. For example someone who likes a dog a cooking a trip and a driving could be my favorite friend. Maybe I'd like to be his or her best friend. If my friend hates a dog or not interested in cooking and driving I couldn't do anything with them. In short I think that a good friend is a comfortable and believable person and has common things with me.
