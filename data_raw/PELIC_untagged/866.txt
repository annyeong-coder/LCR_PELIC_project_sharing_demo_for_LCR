Show me a friend who will weep with me those who will laugh with me I can find myself says Slavic. I completely agree with him because I have the same perspective about a friend especially a close one. In a whole life getting along with a friend is hard. Most of all friends are just aquaintances or buddies who have a contact with us in a short period. After then they who rarely contacting each other go to different ways and continuously make other new friends. Sometimes it is luckly to make few friends close friends who help each other all the time. When I studied in college I made a best friend who studied in a different major from me. At beginning we only meet each other in a student activity. For a long time we found we have the same interests and similar personality. Whenever I met him we always chatted about every thing and couldn't stop it. Even though we often argued with each other it could not alienate us. Moreover when one of us felt depressed the other one could find someway to try to cheer him up. If I made a mistake he could admonish me directly. So I know what kind of character he is and so does he. If he makes a decision I can realize what he wants and why. After graduation although we live different places we still connect with each other regularly by Internet. After I think back on every thing about him not only I had fun with him but also I learned many things from him.
