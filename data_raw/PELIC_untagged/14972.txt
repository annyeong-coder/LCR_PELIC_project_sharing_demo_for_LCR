Taught me of the characters I became a slave of him I would refer to this very old Arabic saying to demonstrate my full respect to professor Akki. I met him while I was studying at the university. When I started working on my final year project I was in need of some help so I knocked to his door. The first impression wasn't encouraging. Day by day and meetings followed each other a strong friendly relationship has grown between us. I learned from a lot from my favorite professor for example on day while he was talking about writing my thesis he said that he dealt with his books like if they were his kids. When I had become a father I figured out how much Mr. Akki has loved his work.
