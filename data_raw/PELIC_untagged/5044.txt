The pyramids are the most mysterious place I have ever seen. First when I saw the pyramids for the first time I was shocked. It has a magnificent view makes you just want to look to it. Also many people have different stories about who made the pyramids but the truth is that the ancient Egyptian builds it. It takes many years for them to build it they where building it stone by stone they were very strong men. So in fact the pyramids are something associated with the ancient Egyptians. When I saw the pyramids I was baffled I was asking myself how could the people built something huge like that and then I notice that the men are totally different than now they were much stronger than now . Also if you look at the pyramids closely you will see a fabulous carves it looks like an artist's made it. There are very big pictures and also there is a very tiny picture. Finally the pyramids has a vary of sizes . It's really an amazing mysterious place
