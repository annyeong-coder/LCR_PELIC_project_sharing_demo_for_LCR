March 20 07 Dear ANON_NAME_0 Ah Hi. Sister. How are you Here is coming spring. How is Korea's weather I want to go back to Korea really. I recently broke my laptop so I want to buy one. I choose already two things. Which kind of laptop do I buy I hope that you give me advice. I will explain you theirs. Frist one thing is Pavilion notebook made from HP. Its moniter size is 14. 1 Inch. And price is 779. 99. Its facility is not bad. Memory is 1024MB and hard driver is 120GB. I think its price is good. Memory is good but computer processing speed is not good. And then hard driver's size is not enough. Second other thing is Satellite notebook made from TOSHIBA. Its moniter size is 17 inch. I like big size but it is heavy either. And then price is 1299. 99. It is more expensive than Pavilion but its facility is better than Pavilion. Memory is 2048MB and hard driver is 160GB. Because memory is very good computer processing speed is very fast. And then hard driver's size is similar with Pavilion. I will consider buying computer carefully. If you recommend one thing I will be more easy to choose one thing. I think most important thing is facility so I like more Satellite. But price is important either. I don't know whether I buy Pavilion or other. Sincerely
