Dear a future ELI student Will you take Writing 4 classes sometime in the future If yes I have information about the classes since I have taken in fall 2009. I hope this helps you to imagine what you will learn in the classes. First of all you will learn that writing in English is not only translation from your language into English. For example if you write something in English it should be incorporated with the logic organization and thought pattern of the natives way. Then you will practice for writing a paragraph. For example I learned how to state my point in a topic and how to support it. I also learned transitions to connect between one idea to the next. Finally you will learn the method of writing an essay. You will practice five types of essays process division and classification cause and effects comparison contrast and problem solution. In fact I wrote all five kinds of essays in the classes and some homework. I hope the above information would be useful for you to know the contents of Writing 4 classes. Sincerely XXXX
