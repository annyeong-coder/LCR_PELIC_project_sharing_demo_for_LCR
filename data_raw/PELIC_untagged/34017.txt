Election Most countries have an election for a lot of things. Today I will talk about the presidential election. One of the candidates is the current president Barrack Obama. The election is decided by the people. So people must pick the best candidate. Before they do they have to know the candidate's goals. A good candidate should see what the people want and what they need. He should fix problems. The one who will be president should be honest with people and he can do they what they need. People must pick the best president for them. That is my opinion about the election.
