Nomadic Tribe Nomadic tribe people most of them are so0 strange. I believe that they have an elemented life. They spend most of the day hunting animals in the forest. When they go to hunt the use simple weapons. They seldom use a rifle or shooting iron. They also use horses to move from place to place. Also when they cook they collect firewood. Because all of this I think they have really difficult lives. I believe that most of them don't know about education to care about it. They just care about the family and how to survive.
