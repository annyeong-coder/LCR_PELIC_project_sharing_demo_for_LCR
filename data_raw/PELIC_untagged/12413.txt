Sports are valuable to society by providing entertainment. If you can remember the year 2002 in Korea you would agree with me. In 2002 Korea was filled with joy and happiness because of the 2002 World Cup. Millions of people came out from their house to support the team at front of the city hall. Even though it rained outside they came out to enjoy and I was one of them. It happened not only in the city hall but also in various places such as bars restaurants schools and sports stadiums. This situation of Seoul was broadcast to different countries because no one had seen this crowd of people outside watching game together and supporting the team. Until 2002 World Cup soccer was only for a few of fans and Korean team did not do very well. However Korean soccer team really did a good job that year. Because of the fact that they were keep winning all country was delighted. Even the people who did not care about the soccer they were enjoying the game too. Thus sports made the people happy and fun. After 2002 when there is an important game such as Olympics and World cup they are still coming out to watch the game together. Watching and supporting the same team together had provided entertainment to the society and the people. This kind of event has been settled as a new trend of enjoying sports due to 2002 World cup.
