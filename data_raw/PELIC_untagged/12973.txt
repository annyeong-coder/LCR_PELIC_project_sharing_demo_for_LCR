ANON_NAME_0 Last Name 4Q Saudi Arabia considered one of biggest industrial countries. Its economy depends on the production of gasoline and other chemical substances which are produced in the factories in the central of cities. The smoke that comes from those substances caused air pollution. Air pollution affected and harmed citizen's health especially people hoe has asthma. Beside of that Saudis consume the gasoline too much. In my perspective the possible solutions for this problem are to build the industrial factories in the deserts and to use public transportation. The first solution of air pollution in Saudi Arabia is to build and establish the factories far away from homes. In Saudia Arabia there are huge areas of empty deserts the government can establish the factories there. In this way the poisoned smoke will vanish in the air where no people live there. To recap restricting the amount of air pollution by building factories in the deserts is the most effective way to solve this problem. Another possible solution is using public transportation as much as possible. This solution relies on the citizens at the first place. Saudis should know better about the damages of air pollution so they can cooperate together in solving this problem. They could transport from distance to another by using buses sub bicycle or walking on foot. To sum up using public transportation is useful solution to reduce the amount of air pollution. Air pollution is a serious problem in Saudi Arabia. It damages people's health and wastes the walls of buildings. To solve this problem government should build the factories in the deserts and people should use public transportation. This way Saudis can breathe fresh air and their health will be better.
