First of all after finish my English classes here in Eli I'll take USMLE preparations courses for step one and two because I'm going to take USMLE step1 exam on first of January 2008. Second I won't visit my countries next one year because I won't have much time. Third I'm going to visit my friends in Michigan when my classmates are going to Philadelphia trip on first days of July. Finally I don't know if I decide a good opinion or not anyway I'm going to do my best.
