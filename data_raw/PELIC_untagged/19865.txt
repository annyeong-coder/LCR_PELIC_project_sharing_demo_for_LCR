My hometown is a oasis which has a lot of palm trees. I live a big farmer which has many palm trees and fruit trees. There are small buildings where there are in the middle of the oasis. However it can be clearly seen the area of my hometown that has a hot weather is a big and wide. Some streets that are broken are very old which made before forty years ago. The animals that can live for weeks without water are many. In addition hawks are a lot in my homwtown. Although the water that is groundwater is diffuclt to get. Yet the technological machines are doing a good job recenntly. Finally my hometown is considered a beautiful area even it is hot. I am happy to live on it.
