I would like to give a positive response. If I were a leader I would prefer to praise my members. When I give to praise for them they would feel confidence to get next target. On the other hands when my boss gives an expectation for me I do not want let him feel depress. So I would like to work harder to respond with him. A motivation attitude has the advantage of helping you gain impression results.
