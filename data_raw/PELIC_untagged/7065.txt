Friends What are the qualities of friends Since coming to Pittsburgh I have also thought about this question. I remember my old friendship who is my best friend we have been friends since we were 14 years old. If the condition of friendship is to keep talking or to call everyday we are not friends. However we know each other and I know we are always friends even after we haven't seen each other for a long time. Though I left many friends in Korea and I know that we can not see one another for a while we don't worry about our relationship which has connected us for a long time. Because we believe that our feelings will never change. Nevertheless how about the time which friends spend together Is it the crucial factor for friends I don't think so. It is true that spending time together is helpful for a friendship but it is not always necessary. I have a lot of people whom I met as acquaintances at first in Pittsburgh and some of them have become my friends relatively quickly because we accepted each other's thoughts and behavior which are similar. I hope that I can meet more friends whom I have not met yet and have a solid friendships.
