I like our grammar classroom being bright and tidy. I would like to open curtains and let the sunshine in. I will turn the light on to make the classroom be bright. I want to hang a clock up on the wall. To do this I can know what time it is. Moreover I would like to pick some flowers up and put them in a vase. Then I will put the vase on the table in front of classroom. I will feel comfortable when I smell the fragrant of the flowers. And I also like to clean the blackboard up and straighten tables up. I think these will help students study efficiently.
