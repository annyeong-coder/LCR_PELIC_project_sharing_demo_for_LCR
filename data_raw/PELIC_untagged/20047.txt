In my opinion woman has the same importance than man. It is evident that both gender have different features but their relevance in society is the same. Traditionally some cultures have put man in a distinct category than woman denying woman's rights and conditioning her life to the willing of a man. However this situation has modifying during last decades due to women have fought to improve their position in society achieving important things as right to vote. In current times we can see women and men developing same jobs cooperating to raise children and respecting each other.
