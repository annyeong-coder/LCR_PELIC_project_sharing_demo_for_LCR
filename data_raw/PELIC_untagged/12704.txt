Dear Mr. Fed up with Dog Poop I am happy that I got your letter in an early time. So you mean your problem is that you won't be able to ask your cute neighbor out with her dog's poop in your back yard. I think the solution is not that difficult as you think because it could be a good chance for you to strike up a conversation with her. I suggest that you make a wise plan to get her. First step you should check the time when she goes for a walk with her dog and then you should pretend to do some house chores in your back yard. As soon as you catch the moment the dog poop you should call her and go over to her. At that time it is necessary that your voice be clear and soft. If she hears your scary and unclear voice she might run way from you. So the tone of voice is important for you to keep her standing on the spot. Second step you should tell her about the dog poop as if you didn't know that before. When you start a conversation it is a better way to praise her dog and you can caress the dog's back and say If you had pooped in a right place you would look lovelier . It is an indirect way of letting someone knows the problem. She would feel sorry and be at loss with her dog poop. At that moment it is desirable for you to help her and show how to clean up. The last step you should share the information about dog's care with her for a minute. If so she feels that you are friendly. From that day you can be familiar with her talking each other often. If you reach the point the half of the trouble will be figured out. You can take some time to ask her to go out. Once you think she opens her mind to you I recommend that you ask her out or have dinner with you. How does my solution sound like It will be more successful if you have a sense of humor and some knowledge of dog otherwise the plan might mess up. Please go and get her!!! Regards Ms. Manners
