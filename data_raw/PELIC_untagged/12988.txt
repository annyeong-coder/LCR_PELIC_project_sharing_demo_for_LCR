I was born in 1980 in Ukraine. When I was 3 my family and I moved to Russia. We lived in Moscow. I went to school when I was 7. Also I visited music and dancing schools. After school I became a student of a music and theater arts institution for 2 years. Then I studied at the Academy of Law and Business during 6 years. After my graduation from the Academy I worked as a lawyer in a construction company. Last year I married. Recently I and my husband came to Pittsburgh. Now I am a student of ELI.
