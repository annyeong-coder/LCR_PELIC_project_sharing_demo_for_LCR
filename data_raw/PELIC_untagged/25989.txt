The correct it The View from my Window My favorite view in the world is the view from my window because of all the magic feelings that I get just by looking at the window . First of all When I see the blue sky with the green hills I admire the magnificence of nature and it made me want to lay on the grass and enjoy the air and the view of the sky . Furthermore when I see the clouds approach to each other and form in a wonderful picture I feel the charm of life . Also when I see the splendor of sunrise and sunset from my window I feel the beauty of the universe . For instance sunrise is a new beginning for everything and sunset is the end of the day with all the joy and grief . Also at the bottom of the window I can see the magnificence of the river and the bridge that running over the river and the landscape full of life . That is why when I wake up every morning I prefer to begin my day by opening the window and enjoying the magic of nature .
