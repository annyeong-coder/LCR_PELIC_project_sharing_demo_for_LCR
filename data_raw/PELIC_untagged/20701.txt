The Interesting place for my childhood The my grandmother's house athletic school and my room are very interesting place for my childhood. In these places have very beautiful memory in my mind. So the first place is my grandmother's house. My grandmother lived in the countryside that it is in the other city. Every time I went to my grandmother house need sited the bus. After thirty minutes I had arrived my grandmother's house. The behind my grandmother's house has a little hill. The little hill is my favorite place. There is a tree house. The tree house was my grandfather made for me. I very like the tree house. Every time I used to go back my grandparents' home I liked stay more than tow hours in my tree house. And in front my grandparents' house has a big garden. These are many fruit trees. In the autumn I liked picked fruit in the garden with my friend in the childhood that it is so fun. In the garden lived my best friend. She is a demi wolf. She is very beautiful. My grandparents are very like her. She liked to play all the time with me. Her name is faire.
