In this paragraph I am responding to what you told us to do as a homework. I think what the speaker said is very efficient and useful. The speaker supported her idea by exemplifying what Alicia and Rosa conflicted about. Alicia thought that Rosa received the most the most love from her parents. The speaker thought that what Alicia said was wrong. She said that Alicia mistake was that she didn't tell Rosa what she felt and she thought the situation would be better if Alicia did what she thought.
