You would be surprised to hear about how many great places to eat in Okland one of my favorites is Estanbul restaurant. It located front the new giant eagle in Okland. It serves middle eastern cuisine like falafel hums kafta and variety of grilled beef and chicken. The prices is inexpensive and it is better to give the waitress a tip. Although the place is not large but the design and the decoration are fascinating. At the end I would this place to everyone because you will defiantly enjoy tasting middle eastern food
