In the United States drinking is only permitted to those over the age of 21. Twenty one is the age where people are at reasonable age and can make more rational decisions with the way they behave. Even though teenagers were allowed to drive at the age of 16 they weren't able to drink till the age of 21. Reasons varied for this debate because it included more psychological and behavioral that made people assume that drinking should only be permitted to those over the age of 21. As we know being under the affect of alcohol can make a person drowsy and unconscious of their behavior and actions. They have less control over themselves and are unaware of their surroundings. For that case drinking was allowed at that certain age that the individual would be considered as an adult and can make more rational and mature decisions. I find it hard to support the idea of allowing drinking alcohol at a young age like 18 because it can bring more harm than bring pleasure. Within the years we have seen that many older people have got younger people in trouble those under age by bringing alcohol to parties or places where teenagers less than 18 would be at. This caused irrational behaviors of people when driving or even controlling their actions. I think that many people between the age of 18 21 are at a point where they are learning things in their lives and are affected by their surroundings without really building their own strong and mature character. That way they could harm themselves or act giddily when not conscious. 18 Could only be a number and might not really define the level of a person's maturity but it sure gives more time for one to be able to learn more and gain experiences before they are willing to lose control over alcohol.
