Ron Jack! Where is the water bottle Jack it here in this bag. Actually the water is about to run out. We have to be carefull using water. I don't know how we can survive in the dessert without it. Ron you're right jack. We must find a nearby lake to fill the bottle with water. Otherwise we will not be able to survive. The weather is so hot here. Jack Yeah! The weather is so hot during day time but at night it might be cold. I don't know how we can sleep! Ron we have better to put the piece of plastic which we have on the sand. We ought to lay on it and cover with the two blankets that we have. Jack Good idea. We should do that.
