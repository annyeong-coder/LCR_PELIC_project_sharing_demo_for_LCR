In this case person should be patient and try to get over of these troubles. I had lost my friend when I was 20 years old. It was terrible moment but iam fine now because iam trying to forget everything. The second reason of sadness is failure. Each one avoids all types of failure. For example failure of life marriage business. Some people have wisdom and trying to learn from their failure . They consider their failure as lesson for them to identify their errors and correct them in the future. We can not avoid effect of failure in the beginning like resenting and frustration but we can get over this failure day in and day out . The third reason of sadness and from my perspective it is an important cause of sadness that is lack of health. We understand value of health and people without health can not live happy and satisfied even if they wealthy. If we are not careful about our health we will affected by health trouble and thai is make us unhappy.
