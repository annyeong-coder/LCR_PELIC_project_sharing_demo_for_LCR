People have been supposed to learn English as a second language. Even though English is still on of the most important language it is not the only one language that we are supposed to learn. English has contributed learning other languages. Therefore multilingual population is becoming much more common. Also I think Nye's experience in 'Gate 4A' agree with the argument. The circumstances in Gate 4A relieved with Nye's starting conversation in Arabic even though she was not fluent in Arabic. Furthermore people around Gate 4A share cookies that the old lady has and they become friendly for now. Overall both say that multilingualism is becoming common.
