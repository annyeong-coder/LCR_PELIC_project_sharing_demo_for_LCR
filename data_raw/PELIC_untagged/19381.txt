My husband I met my husband in 2003. At that time he was studying medicine in a different university than me. I did a rotation in his hospital and we had a patient in common so he offered to help me!. Then maybe it was destiny the last day of my rotation I found him at the elevator and he asked for my phone. After that he was calling me but I had boyfriend so I never went out with him. After two years I broke up with my exboyfriend and we went to get a drink in that moment it was a real love and we were together for about 4 years after that he was admited to a Surgery program in UPMC so he moved to Pittsburgh in june of 2008. The distance was very hard for both so we decided to get married in march of this year and I moved to Pittsburgh too we have been living together since then and I feel very happy and very lucky to have found him!
