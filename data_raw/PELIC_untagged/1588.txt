When I was in high school a teacher gave me a good reason to improve my self. First she made me think about the future. Second she made me look for what was good for me so I completed my studying. Then I thought studying other language would help me to become successful so I kept studying English because I knew it was important to get a good job and become successful. Lastly I think that my teacher s advice changed my life.
