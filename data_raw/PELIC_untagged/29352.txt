I think that my life wouldn't be as nice as the life I had lived in my country if I had been born and raised in the United State. I wish I would be with the same family and friends if I had born in US. But still it wouldn't be much fun like what I used to live in my country if I lived in US. I wish I could go back in time and see what I would do if I lived in US and go back to real life after that experience.
