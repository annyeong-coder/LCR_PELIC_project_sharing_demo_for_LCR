Dear Confused Your letter reminds me to Romeo and Juliet of William Shakespeare. So I found out one important thing that you might not think about it before. You said that your boyfriend's parents love to have you as a daughter in law. So why don't you invite your boyfriend and his parents join your summer at Japan You should introduce them to your family. However your parents don't want them to be family members they will welcome them as their guests. You should make them do some activities together in order to breaking the ice and build relationship. Even if this mission fails at the first time you shouldn't give up. You should try one more time. For this time you make your parents as a guest at your boyfriend's house in the US. Then you have to study the result. If it turns out to be a happiness congratulations! You will get marry in soon but if it's not. You have to postpone your wedding. You'd better give them more time to learn each others. This is the best solution that I suggest you. I hope it will guide you some idea. Good luck. Sincerely Advisor
