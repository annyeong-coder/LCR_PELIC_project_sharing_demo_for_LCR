I love the town where I born and it means a lot for me. When you go away from your home you feel homesick which is a feeling of longing to home. When I was a child I used to play in our farm which is near to a large tree I used to go to this tree with my brother ANON_NAME_0 who is older than me. We used to play around the tree and climb on the branches. At the time when the tree became out of leaves we gathered the leaves and draw it on our notes which was brought specially for this .
