In my perspective the acquaintance is a person who I meet occasionally my be in the bus I said hello for him I might speak with him. But the friend is a person who I enjoy having fun with him and Who knows some things about my life also who is an easygoing person. The best friend is a person who is unique I trust him all the time and who trust me all the time we know the secrets of each other. Who also help me when I need him and I help him in return he is my old brother and I love him so much.
