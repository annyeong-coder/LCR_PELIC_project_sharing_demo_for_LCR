Festivals in my culture In my culture we have two festivals which are Eid al Adha and Eid al Fitr Frist Eid al Adha which is the great one. We celebrate this holiday by going to the mosque and doing prayer that is after sunrise. After that we go to Slaughtering of sacrificial animals which are in the farms and slaughtered by a man who is a specialist in the slaughter. Then take the meat and divide it into three parts. First part which gives to the poor is a large part and other part gives to our friends. Second Eid al Fitr that comes after Ramadan. We celebrate this holiday by doing the same thing but without Slaughtering. The aim of this festive compiling the family and enter the happiness into poor's hearts who have no money and family.
