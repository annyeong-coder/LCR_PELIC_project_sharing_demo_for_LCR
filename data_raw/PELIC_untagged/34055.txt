My ideal home is a new medium and modern. It is absolutely comfortable for four people to live. It is located in a beautiful quiet area and convenient to transportation. Also the neighbors would be very kind and nice. I can go for walks safely in the neighborhood. There are four bedrooms my bedroom is on the second floor. My bedroom is white and clean. It has a large comfortable bed and soft blanket so that I can wake up late. Also I really want a big sunny kitchen with perfect kitchenware. The living room would have a high ceilings and be filled with light . It is neat and tidy. I want to have a lot of big trees in the backyard. I can hang up a few swings on the tree. I like to swing very quickly. It also has a huge garden in the backyard. I can grow many kinds of vegetables. I like to eat vegetables from my garden very much.
