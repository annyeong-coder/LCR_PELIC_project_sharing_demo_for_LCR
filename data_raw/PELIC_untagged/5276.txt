Graduation is next month! I need to make some plans now because when exams start I won't have any free time. What am I going to do when I finish school My roommate is going to take a vacation before she looks for a job. I won't do that because I need to earn some money soon. I think that after I graduate I am going to take a word processing class. As soon as I learn word processing I will look for a job as a bilingual office assistant. It's hard to find full time jobs though. Part time jobs are easier to find. Maybe I'll take a part time job after I find a good full time one. Or maybe I'll take a workshop in making decisions before I do something!
