There are very charming scenery out my window. First you can see a path in front of the window. The path is always clean there are many trees besides the road. I like to walk in the eveningA grand church behind the road. Many people go to church every sunday. Then you can find a white special house on the right of the church there are all kinds of flowers and plants in the garden of the house it is beautiful! Next to the white house is a stone house. It is dark and strange I don't like it! Finally there is a playgroud for children on the left of the church. It is funny time for children in the summer evening.
