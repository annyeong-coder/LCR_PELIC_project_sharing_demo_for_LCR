Love is the most important relation ship for me for several reasons. First I met her in coffee shop in Gainesville Florida 9 months ago. I was feeling in love with her since that moment. She was gorgeous and everyone was looking at her. Her name is Jomana. She is from India and she used to study English with me at University of Florida. Really I was having a great days with her and I miss her so much.
