Topic My favorite comic is Dragon Ball. Why did I very like the Dragon Ball First of all the leading role was a good man he had a lot of power to fight a bad guy which came from the alien place. Second all of the story was fall of the amazing and fantastic liked the universal monsters or planets. Then every time the monster wanted to attack the earth he always protected the people of earth and fought with the monster. It liked Spider Man in America. So he used to be a hero in my mind when I was young. Now I still very like this comic. Dragon Ball is my favorite comic.
