Garbage has been an important topic recently. Because of mass produced product garbage has started to occupy many places in developed countries. Also garbage's chemical substances have destroyed our nature. Therefore garbage should be separated by depending on what the materials were and it should be recycled to new products to save natural resources. Finally we will need to accept the real situation that our nature is on and try to enhance treatment for the garbage because we must save the resources to give them to our sons and daughters.
