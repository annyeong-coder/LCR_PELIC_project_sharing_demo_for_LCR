The worst meal I have ever had since I came to the United States was Chinese food in Penn State. The first impression of the US was very chilly and white snow spreading all over the places and I completely froze. This place was totally different from the places I used to live the place I used to live is plenty of skyscrapers traffic jam people and cars running on the streets all days and nights full of petroleum smelly air. Penn State which is absolutely countryside made me want to go back my hometown immediately and caused me a little melancholy. However I became homesick after a week's stay in the dormitory. I turned into an unfamiliar person I had never experienced before such as silent introverted unsociable and not interested in anything. All of my friends were fraught about me and they convened to discuss how to cheer me up. Next they came up an idea that I could try some food which tasted similar to our mother's cooking at home and then my attention of sickness would displace by delicious food. I was very excited about going out that I acted like a bird flying out of the cage. After we arrived at a well decorated restaurant the waitress took our orders. While we were waiting I was full of curiosity about what Chinese food tasted like in America. The food was delivered which looked bizarre. Although I was a little bit afraid of the food however I still gave it a try. The rice was as hard as stone to chew and they put too much oil and salt. There wasn't any mother's homemade cooking flavor in that meal all it had was plastic flavor. The flavor was totally catastrophe. I got for what I paid so it wasn't supposed to be that expensive. After that horrible experience I barely go to any Chinese restaurants in the US. Even though I am living in Pittsburgh I have only been to Chinese restaurant twice so far.
