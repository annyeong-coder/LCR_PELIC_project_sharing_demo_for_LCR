When I grew up my grandmother used to go to an orphanage every day. She spend one hour of her day in order to play with the children living there. Since my grand mother was a busy lady she was doing an effort to go. When she died I tried to do the same but I never made it my priority so I usually changed my compassion for my obligations . Given these I think my grandmother's generation was more authentic. We at least I try to be compassionate when it should be something natural.
