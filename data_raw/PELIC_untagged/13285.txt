I have a blue printed plan in my life I would like to generate my own business in my mid age and become a well known enterpriser like Bill Gaze. Now I have something to work on. First I need to get a MBA degree in U. S. A. Which is believed that going abroad studying is the best choice. Besides to be a top businesswoman English will be essential my English is going to be better and better during my graduate school life. After I finish my MBA I am sure I will gain the technical skills from school. Then the show is on my fancy new business like will start. First I need to get a job gain some experiences and I would have experienced everything before I start my own business. During my employee life I will look for some elite and suitable people for my company. Then after everything are set I will have my own company. I am looking forward it.
