In my opinion medical experiments on chimpanzees shouldn't be banned for many reasons. First because some diseases like hepatitis c and AIDS only infect piramates such as humans and chimpanzees and the similarity between their biological systems help to achieve better results. Also the benefits of conducting these experiments on chimpanzees outweight their disadvantages. Although chimpanzees might be exposed to harmful procedures during these experiments thousands of people could be cured of an epidemic disease such as AIDS if experiments worked out. However a satisfying outcomes must be noticed during these experiments or otherwise we are just torturing the animals.
