You are going to learn how to make a cup of coffee and have a first date with your boyfriend. You are thinking about clothes. You ask me to what you wear. You want to wear white dress because the white dress is your favorite. I think that's not a good idea because usually you are make mistakes. I suggest you to wear another dress. If you spill coffee all over your white dress you should change your clothes. But you don't have enough time to change your clothes and the white dress's stain doesn't erease easily. Then you are going to be sad. If you wear black dress to the class you spill coffee all over your dress you could go to meet your boyfriend and he cannot see the stain well though.
