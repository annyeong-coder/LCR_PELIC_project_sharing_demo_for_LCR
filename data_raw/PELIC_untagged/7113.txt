Dear Paul Today I have a meeting at 8 30 AM I need to go first. For the party tonight I've already done several things. Please check below I've already cleaned and decorated the house. Also I've already made chicken salad baked the blueberry pie and cooked mushroom soup. However I've never bought the balloons before so I don't know where I can buy them. Please buy them on your way home. I haven't picked up the chocolate cake and black cherry ice cream yet. Please pick them up on your way home too. After everything is done we will have a very nice and exciting party!
