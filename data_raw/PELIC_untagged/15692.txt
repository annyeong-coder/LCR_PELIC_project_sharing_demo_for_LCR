During my learning of English language in the ELI classrooms I feel convenience and sometimes I think about how I should pick up my language skills like native speakers. Actually our teacher's attitudes make me feel good. For instance I am kind of person who like to be corrected from somebody else so our teachers always try to work out our mistakes. That is why we looked up to our teacher. On the other hand there are somethings should be change in some classrooms to improve the design of it. Thus I am always try to find out what we should do. For example In my opinion we should move cabinet around to get more spaces hang up some pictures cover the window up to avoid sunlights take stuff on the cabinet away as well as think up separate board for announcement papers.
