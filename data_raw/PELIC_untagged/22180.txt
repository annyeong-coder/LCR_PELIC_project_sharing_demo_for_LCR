I live in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in Riyadh city. Saudi Arabia has 2 seas one is called the Arabian Gulf and the other called the Red Sea. The weather is mostly hot or worm except for the winter. A famouse cuisine in my country is Kapsa a rice and chicken cuisine that made with a special type of spices. Arabic is the official language although we use English to speack with any forigns. So if you visit my country don't worry about being understood.
