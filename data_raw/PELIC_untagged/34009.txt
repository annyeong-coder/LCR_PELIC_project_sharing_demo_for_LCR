First of all I agree with him for studying English before he goes to graduate school. In my perspective I recommended that he chooses Pittsburgh instead San Francisco for many aspects. It has a strategic region. For example it nears to niagra falls. In addtion it near to New York and Washington so that he had an alternative choise when he want to travel back to Spain. Moreover as he said the leve of living is cheaper than San Fransisco the rate of tax of Pittsburgh is cheaper than San Fransisco . In addtion there are many universities approximately 7 universities so they will asses him to have alternative choise Because of the abundance of the universities. Despit of the terrible change of temperatures within summer and winter seasons it is still attract a lot of students. Finally one of the significant factor for choosing Pittsburgh and especially ELI that he can use the bus free by using the student ID. In conclusion I recommended that he chose Pittsburgh due to all relevant features that mentioned before.
