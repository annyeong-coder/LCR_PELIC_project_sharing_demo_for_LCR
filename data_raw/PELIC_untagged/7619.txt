I have been a car accident in the U. S. I and my friends were going to the Philadelphia to travel. Our car was stopped when we got a red light. At that time one car which was driven about 40 miles hit our car. Our car was shaken by the car we were very surprised. Our car's back bumper was broken. Fortunately nobody who was in our car was injured. Everybody is OK.
