The difference between buddy word and friend word The definition of buddy word that I saw on Longman dictionary is a person you don't know him or her and the definition of friend word that I saw on Longman dictionary is a person you are really know him or her. But when I asked some native speaker the man who I asked told me the definition for buddy word is a person really likes him or her and enjoy spending time with him or her. And the meaning for friend whose speaker give me is a person you know him or her but not very much. These meaning whose I knew from Longman dictionary and native speaker are confusing me.
