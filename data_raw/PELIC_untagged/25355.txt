William and other children looked at Margot and anticipated some words from her but nothing there for a long time. Maybe a long time was not true but it seemed true to the children. How was the sun The first is not blame but asking their feeling. The children was surprised and there existed another silence. The sun was the same as you say about. I'm very sorry. Margot William replied with his sincere apology. Though I really wanted to see the sun but it's okay because now I can share the sun with you and wait for it together. William and other children hugged Margot as she finished her saying and started to say loud her name. The sun did not only give warm temperature but also warm mind among children in Venus.
