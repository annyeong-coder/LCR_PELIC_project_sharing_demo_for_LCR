Childhood was fun but there are many things I wasn't able to do. For instance when I was 10years old I couldn't play soccer good but now I can play it good. Also when I was 10years old I was full of energy I was able to do every things but now I'm lazy. The hard thing for me was to defend my self against older people but now I can to defend my self against them. No one can forget childhood.
