There are many kinds of doing this weekend. First I have to get up early because I have a car so I have to wash my car and I am so tidy I have to clean my house and I have to go laundry because of my clothes. Then I have to study for my English improving and I will go to libraray because of Toefl exam so I have to take Toefl test for transfer undergraduate student. After I will go to SevenSprings with my friends I love SevenSprings because I like to snowboard and it is amazing. Next I have really good time because snowboard is really extereme too much adrenaline when I just came in Pittsburgh. Moreover I will go to Firehouse Lounge because of my life so I love electronic music to listen and I am an amateur Dj in my country.
