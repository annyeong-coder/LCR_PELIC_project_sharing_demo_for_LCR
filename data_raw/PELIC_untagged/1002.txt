Dear Lan Oct 19 2006 Do you remember last time you asked me to help you to buy a watch Yesterday I went to shop in a watch store I saw two different brand watches that you might be like but I'm not sure which one is better for you. The one brand is Swatch watch the other one is Citizen watch. There are some different ways between Citizen and Swatch. The first Citizen is more expensive than Swatch but Citizen's warranty is longer than Swatch's. Citizen has three years warranty but Swatch only has one year warranty. Second Citizen's material is better than Swatch's because Citizen's watch made of steel products. On the other hand Swatch's watch made of plastic. Third Citizen's watch is lady style in contrast Swatch's watch is cuter and more colorful. So that's why I can't decide for you. If you want to see those watches please search on internet then tell me which one you prefer. Warmly
