I'll talk about the Pandits family and yours financial situation. I pretend give to them some suggestions to get out of debt. In my opinion the first thing that they must do is review all the financial situation together and cut the expenses. Second and last if it's not enough they can find an adviser to help the family in this case. It can be a big help to them. They can cut a lot of things in their expenses monthly. First I suggest them to cut a good part of the vacations and entertainment because it's good for family but it's not so necessary. Another thing they can cut expenses with furniture and appliances if eventually it's necessary that's ok but not every year like a rule. If they do it your financial deficit goes down. I believe that the mother can work too. She travels every time with her daughter for competitions but she probably has free time too. So I think that this is a way to make money and part of the solution for Pandits financial problems. I think that they just have one exit to go out of their debts to save money every month and the mother work too. But to it happen they need to be conscious about their financial situation. They have to have more personal control and they can't spend more money than they earn. The money will works for them if they keep save money monthly even if it's few they can do money to make money. About the education and medical costs in my opinion it's a hard area to save money because it's so important to the life of any people. However they can look about financial support from the government and they can take some information about file for bankruptcy. I believe that Pandits family can have a good financial life. When they begin to save money monthly they can do payments of credits cards and high interests. In addition of my suggestions I annexed a table with reduced costs to try helping that family.
