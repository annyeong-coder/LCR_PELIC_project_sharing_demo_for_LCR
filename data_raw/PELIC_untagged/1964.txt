When I arrived Pittsburgh before two weeks the weather was nice. The last seven days it changed to cold. Now you can't walk outside without warm yourself. Somebody maybe die. In my country the weather cold at this time but here is more than. Some country at south of the Earth now is warm and the people there say goodbye for the winter session.
