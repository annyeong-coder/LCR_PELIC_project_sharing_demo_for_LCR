As I visited the Elephant Rock Beach I saw the high waves generated by the heavy wind. I watched the rocks washed by the waves at the windy beach while I getting moist wind from the sea. The sky was clouded over and humid air. However I was really touched by wide expanses of distant view. It was cool. The weather was really bad and cold but usually not like this. If it was fine I was able to see the quiet sea and colorful backdrop
