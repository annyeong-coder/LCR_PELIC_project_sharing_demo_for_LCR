I Remember that days when I was child. I lived in Tripoli which located in north of Libya. Tripoli where lived for fifteen years is the biggest city in Libya. I still remember the school that I studied in. ANON_NAME_0 who was my best teacher is really good man. I remember every weekend when we went on picnic. We usually went with my friend Idel whose home near the school.
