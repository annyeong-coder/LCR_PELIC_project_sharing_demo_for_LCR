We went to Seven Spring a few weeks ago with our friends. We made some activities such as skied with sled walked on the snow and played with snow. I believe that the ski line which was one of the longest ski lines in Pennsylvania. We used them too much time to ski. After we skied we lost too much energy for this reasons we ate some bananas because we didn t find any food. We thought that if we had some fish or meat we could have a picnic. I think we were very lucky because the weather was sunny therefore everybody was very happy.
