Dear my friend I know you are recently in a bad situation. But I think you can change your life. First you MUST give up smoking and also you SHOULD go to a gym and exercise regularly. Moreover you OUGHT TO see a psycholog for your mental problems. You HAD BETTER find a suitable job for you and you SHOULD set your alarm not to be late for job.
