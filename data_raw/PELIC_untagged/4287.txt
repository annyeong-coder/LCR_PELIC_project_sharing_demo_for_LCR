As we all know the great pyramids in the Egypt are still a great mystery to this day. No body couldnt know how to build it so people must be study how to build it. I think the great pyramids were built that it must have spent the labor of thousands of workers. Most of them had to have been Israelites because Israelites were Egyptian slaves. How were the workers able to lift heavy blocks They might have transported the blocks using wooden rollers to slide them along. According to some theories the workers had to have lifted the blocks by the use of telepathy. Some people thought the workers could have lifted the blocks by the power of thought. Though we couldnt have known how to build the pyramids but they were important world wonderment.
