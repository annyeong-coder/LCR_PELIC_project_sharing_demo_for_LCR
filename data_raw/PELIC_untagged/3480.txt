Dear Alok I have a problem want to share with you. That is I want to by the notebook. But I don't know which one is better. I need your help to choose the best notebook for me. Here are two reasons. There are Dell E1405 and Dell E1505 notebooks. I change first one is A and the other one is B. The cost of the A is 799 and the B is 899. The B is more expensive than the A 100. The colors are both black and silver gray. I like this color very much. The size of A is 14. 1 And B is 15. 4 . The A's size is smaller than the B. And the capacities of these are same. For example the memories of both are 1GB and hard drives are 120GB. I think both are okay but I want to hear your opinion. Resend e mail to me please. Sincerely
