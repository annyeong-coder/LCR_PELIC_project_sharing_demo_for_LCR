My favorite place is a Vietnamese restaurant. There is in Penn Avenue Lawrenceville. It has many foods and a lot of interesting things. There is many photos and pictures what describe about Vietnam's sight seeing and people in that restaurant. I sometimes go there to enjoy Vietnamese foods and musics. I sometimes come there on Sunday with my relative.
