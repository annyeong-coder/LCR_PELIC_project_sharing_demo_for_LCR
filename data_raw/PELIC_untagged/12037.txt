Shirley my best friend was my classmate when I was a college student. We had the same English class when we were freshman. The first time we met she sat near me and told me about her feeling nervous in the first class. We talked a lot after class and since this we became close friends. We usually went out on the weekend because we had a lot of things to chat about. I felt comfortable when I talked to her. Also we shared things that happened everyday. For example friends family and studies. Now she is a graduate student in our university. We are still stay in touch now. She is my closest friend in my life.
