My friends always make a piece of advice. An act of violence can't be ignored without punishment. A clap of art changes the world. I played a game of tennis with my friends. A speck of dust makes my throat hurt. I need some furniture to decorate my room. Most Americans drink coffee a day. Honesty is my weapon. There is nothing more valuable than love. Time is gold.
