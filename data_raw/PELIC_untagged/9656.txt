It can seem very complicated to build a bookcase if it is your first time working with wood nails and glue. However it can become easier and a funny work if you follow these steps. First of all you need to work with the right material such as wood nails glue a hammer a saw sandpaper and paint. The first step is to cut wood pieces in specific size such as 2 side pieces measuring 11 5 8 by 28 3 pieces for top bottom and shelf measuring 11 5 8 by 13 each one 1 back piece measuring 15 by 28 and two 10 each one that you use as molding strips. Next you need to sand each piece of wood until you get a smooth surface. After that glue one molding strip to each side pieces in a position 14 down from top. Now it is time to use the hammer and the nails and take care with your fingers if it is your first time driving a nail in the wood. At this point you need to nail side pieces to bottom and after that also nail the top in place. Soon afterward nail the back piece in place too. When you finish to nail all pieces it is time to paint the bookcase and shelf. Then during 2 hours you need to let the bookcase dry. The last step is to slide the shelf into place.
