I ate my best meal two years ago. I love to eat beef and this is my favorite. That meal was the best steak I have eaten. Foie gras was on steak. Foie gras is one of the most delicious three foods in the world which means oily liver in French. At that time I did not know about Foie gras. I just heard that is something delicious. Then my father said to me that is the liver of the goose. I was shocked but not as much as I ate dog meat so I ate them immediately. It was so delicious. It was melting on my tongue softly.
