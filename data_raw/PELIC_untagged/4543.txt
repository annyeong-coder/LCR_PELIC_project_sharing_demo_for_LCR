Planning a Trip. When you are planning a trip you need to have some ideas and decide what you want for this trip. I think the most important part when you are planning a trip is to find a place that is exciting and beautiful with the beaches great hotels and a lot of night places. You can look at the internet for these places because there are a few ANON_NAME_0 where you can look for this paradise or you can go to the travel agency and they can give you some recommendations about what you want. Another way to find a place is to talk with your friends about their experience or ask them if they know some places that you are looking for. Then you can choose the island or city that you want for example with white sand beach different colors when you see the ocean wonderful hotels and exciting night life. When you find the tropical paradise you can choose the people who will join you for this trip. If you want a love trip on an exotic island you only need one person someone who increases your heart rate someone who one second with her it's enough for the rest of your life someone who shares with you your dreams your love and your fantasies. Obviously this person is not easy to find. This kind of trip you can share with the woman who you love if she wants to enjoy a magnificent adventure. On the other hand if you want a crazy trip the best companies are your best friends. You can share with them all your adventures drink until you can find more liquor eat every day all day go to the night clubs and try to make and approach with girls and when you have time take a rest or perhaps do some sports.
