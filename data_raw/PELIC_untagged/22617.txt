I've seen a lot of alien's movies including E. T. Star Wars Man in Black and District 9. That's the movies some of which got Academy awards. To be specific I like the humorous alien's movies examples of which are Man in Black and District 9. My favorite movie is Man in Black directed by Barry Sonnenfeld starring Tommy ANON_NAME_0 Jones Will Smith and Vincent D'Onofrio and featuring hilarious song and vivid creature effects.
