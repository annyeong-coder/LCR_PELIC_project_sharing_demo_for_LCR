I am going to write about my achievement getting the licence of Japanese traditional flower arrangement. I got the license of it ten years ago. The japanese traditinal flower arrangement is one of the arts. I had been studying the style of flower arrangement before I got the licence and I had watched a lot of works which others arranged. Initially I had imitated teacher's works before I did not understand how to arrange the flowers. I had not conciderd giving up before I got it because I liked it very much. Finally I succeeded to get the licence and I enjoy to arrange the flowers now.
