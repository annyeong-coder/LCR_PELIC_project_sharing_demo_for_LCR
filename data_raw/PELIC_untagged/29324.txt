For my perspective I think if I had been born and raised in the United State I would have been a native speaker. I would not spent a long time to learn English grammar. Also I could have spoken fluently. I would have worked in any American company easily. I could have carried the American passport. I could have lived all my life in the United State without being worried about the emigration rules. Finally I would have had a wonderful democratic society to live.
