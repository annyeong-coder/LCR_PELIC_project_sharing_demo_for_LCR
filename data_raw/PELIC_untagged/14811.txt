Pets or Music There are some activities that you can do in your free time to get out of the work stress. Some people prefer to have fun and go out with their pets. In contrast other people like to listen to music. In my opinion I think listening to music is the best activity that I prefer to do because you don't have any thing to care about. What you have to do is just downloading the music and listening to them at home or while you are walking in the park by using your I pod which make me feel relax. My friend has told me about his previous experience with his dog. He said that his dog wasn't following his orders and he had a lot of trouble with his niehgbors because the dog was used to lay on the flowers in their gardens. One more disadvantage of having pets I watched a TV program demonstrates the heath problems that my pets have and if you are not taking care of them. Some of those heath problems may cause allergy to human if they are not treated as soon as possible.
