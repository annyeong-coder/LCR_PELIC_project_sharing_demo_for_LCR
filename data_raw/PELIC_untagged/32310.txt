Women are better parents than men result from main reasons. For example in the nature women are who have the ability to be pregnant consequently give a new birth and breastfeeding him. Moreover women are more understanding about taking care of children. Mothers are considered the resource of love forgiving and tolerance. Men's role in general is working to offer enough money for raising their children. Although some people believe that men are the main financial resource for family I strongly believe that there are great successful women who have their own work and business for example Lubna Al Ulyan. Recently there are many women who work on sensitive jobs such as executive manager. In conclusion women can play mother's and father's role on the other hand men can not.
