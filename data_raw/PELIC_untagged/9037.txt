It was in 2005. My job was to supervise a survey. The last day of the survey I notice that Hamed who was the most dynamic of the team cheated by completing the sheets himself. My job is to report any wrong act. I didn't report that case. Should I have reported it Hamed will lose his job. But he should not have cheated. He could have asked me to prolong one or two days more. He could have also asked a help to finish his part of work. To be honest his work was too heavy for one person and I am wondering if I should have worried about that his cheating. Our boss should have given us less work. They could have hired more persons by team. Anyway I learned a lot with that case no one was really serious in that chain. At the top our boss themselves.
