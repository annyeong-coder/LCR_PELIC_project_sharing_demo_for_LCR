Hello ANON_NAME_0 I am thinking about having a short trip in summer vacation. My husband cannot have a long vacation so it's going to be two or three days trip. I haven't decided where we will go yet but I have several ideas. One of the ideas is visiting a beach. Now I am looking for beautiful beach I can go by my car. I'm interested in Amelia Island of Florida though it is too far to go by car. Another idea is a trip to Canada. I have visited Niagara Falls once so I want to visit Toronto this time. My friend who visited Toronto told me that there are great shopping places. Since I heard that I have wanted to visit there. Anyway I want to enjoy summer before I go back the next semester in ELI. Have a wonderful summer! Sincerely ANON_NAME_1
