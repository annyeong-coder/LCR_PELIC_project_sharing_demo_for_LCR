It is famous a slogan in Korean advertisement. It is Age it is only number. That means which of you're old or young it doesn't matter about if you have clear objective. When I said I am going to go US. Many people who around me told that It's too late challenge of you. Because you're old to study for learning English. Actually I did ever think like that. But I don't think so anymore now. I looked at other student comes from each country in ELI. They have been took an object why they should study English. Some student could go on to the university the other student might go on to graduate school and another student may look for get a job. Also all students are not young. I did talk with some old student. They told me that Old or young it is no reference to study something. Important thing is we did new challenge for by oneself. Have a confidence. You may become like you want something. Finally I felt that now which is important to me and known true mean about Age is only number.
