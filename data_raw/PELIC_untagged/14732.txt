In my opinion foreign movies are a good way to learn about a different country and culture. Because in movies they always include the ways they live and the slang they use. It always relevant to the live and maybe it doesn't show in a obvious way but we can guess according to a movie. So I think watching movies is a good way to learn about a different country and culture.
