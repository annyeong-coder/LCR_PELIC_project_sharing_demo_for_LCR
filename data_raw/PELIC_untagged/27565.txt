Firstly I will paint the wall into blue color. Then hang up a mirror on the wall. I would like add more lights and turn on all of them. I also would take some chairs away then there would be enough space and the chairs can keep away from each other. Also if it is possible I want to turn the classroom around and then when the students come into the classroom they can see Peter firstly. I would like to bring a vase and fill it in with flowers. Finally I will clean the whole room up and fix up the equipments which do not work well.
