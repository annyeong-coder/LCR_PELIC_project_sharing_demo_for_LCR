In Leipzig Germany Sarie Teichfischer who lost her job 2 years ago founded a choir. Most of its members are unemployed. Some of them have been jobless for over five years. She started the choir because she realized that the unemployed could lose their confidence and found it difficult to interact with other people. By forming a group where everyone is experiencing the similar situation makes it much easier for people to socialize. The choir has indeed dramatically improved the life of the unemployed. Sarie Teichfischer noticed that the pride of the members is building up and the dignity is coming back. They also become more hopeful for the future and are actively looking for jobs. For Sarie Teichfischer however the only fear in getting a new job is that she would have to give up the choir.
