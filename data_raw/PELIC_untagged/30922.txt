The using of miniature horses along with other service animals is a great recourse for disabled people. Even though we used to see blind people with the see eye dogs the miniature horses became popular guides for their owners. It happened because of few positive factors they are mild mannered they live longer than dogs approximately 30 years they have 360 degree range of vision they are naturally cautious and as herd animals they instinctively match their stride with others. However there are few disadvantages as well. Because of big size they need more space then dogs. Also horses eat and go to the bathroom more frequently. Despite of these disadvantages blind people like Edie prefer miniature horses because they consider them as the great helpers. Government support disabled people in wish to go with service animals wherever they want. Since people could run into animals everywhere distinct attitudes appear. Someone enjoys it someone not. People even think that someone could abuse the low to get special privileges for their pets but others try to struggle for the rights in a court. This dispute doesn t have any straight answer there are obviously pros and cons but I think disabled people definitely should have their rights to use their helpers as much as it possible.
