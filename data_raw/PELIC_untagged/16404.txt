Describe the process involved in making your favorite meal. Write an introduction 1 2 body paragraphs and a conclusion. My favorite meal is fried rice noodle. I just learned this dish one week ago I camped with my mother to ask her how to fry it . Because I want to share my favorite dish with my friends who have never tried it before. Before fry the noodles I should prepare the ingredients first. My mother told me the ingredients should be mushroom cabbage dry shrimp and pork . At first rice noodles have to be soak for ten minutes then slide mushroom cabbage and pork. After noodles come to be soft start to fry this ingredients . In the beginning put little oil then fry the pork with soybean sauce The next is putting in the mushroom and cabbage . Because I don't have dry shrimp I didn't put it in. When these are cooked put the soft rice noodles in then mix noodles and ingredients together . The noodles become to be dry after frying so put the water which you washed the mushroom with . It will make the noodles taste more strong . If it's not salty enough put more salt or soybean sauce in. Finish these steps here is it. I was so glad that I learned one more traditional Taiwanese food. Although it sounds easy the cook still need some skills . For example how much water should be put in and how much sauce should be pour in. Of course my friends love my fried noodles on the day even they ask me to fry it for them next time.
