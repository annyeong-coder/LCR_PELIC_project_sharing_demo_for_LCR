There are many differences between urban areas and rural areas in Taiwan. One of the most important differences is shops. People always need to shop items to use food to eat and clothes to wear. There are many shops on every street in urban areas and the shops there are always variety. When you ride a scooter on a street you can see stores selling clothes food books maybe furniture and lots of products you can think of for life. Just ride only one street and you can get everything you want! You also can see the same store twice or even three times on the same street. Isn't that incredible But when you are in the rural area you need to ride almost 20 to 30 minutes to find a store and probably cannot buy all the items you need. In addition it is convenient to buy hot food in the middle of the night in urban areas not only because there are many shops in this region but also because they are 24 hour shops. For example the place where I lived in Taiwan there is a convenient store near my house. It only takes me five minutes to walk there and it really is a 24 hour shop. Even though there are less people go on the street at night. On the other hand when you walk on a street at the same time in the rural area there are no people around not to mention a 24 hour shop. So if people want to choose where to live in the future they probably will choose the urban area.
