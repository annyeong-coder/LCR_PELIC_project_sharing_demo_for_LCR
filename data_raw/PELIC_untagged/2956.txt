Centr Where to Start New Family indent A city has more to offer a new family than a rural area. These things include jobs and institutions. There are more work opportunities for young couples in a city than in a rural area. Unemployment is much lower in urban centers. One reason for this is that many jobs in rural areas are seasonal. It is more common for large companies to be based in the city. Even though the cost of living is higher in the city than it is in a rural area people who work in the city tend to have much higher salaries. Furthermore financial stress is a leading cause of divorce and leads to the break up of families. Moreover the city offers important institutions such as the best hospitals and schools that rural areas don't always have. For instance people who get sick or have babies in rural areas often have to travel to the city for medical attention. This can lead to bills and transportation problems. While their parents have to commute to work kids sometimes have to travel a long way on a bus to school. All of the travel takes away from family time. In addition kids who grow up in rural areas are less likely to go to post secondary schools. Most have to go to the city to get a good education. In conclusion living in the city is a new trend for young families.
