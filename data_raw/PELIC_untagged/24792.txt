Daredevil sports Sports are good for our body health. But there are many daredevil sports in my young group that include some new sports. I think there are three kind of the daredevil sports bungee jumping surfing and parkour . The first daredevil sport is bungee jumping which is a very exciting outdoor activity in current century. The person jump from a tall structure while connected to a elastie cord and there is a river under the structure. Maybe that is more safe . When the person jumps the cord oscillate up and down. It makes less power for the cord. Second is surfing. Maybe I think it is daredevil because I can not swimming. Surfing is a wave powered using their own skill and balance sport. A person stand on the surfboard that must study for a long time. Next the player must learn find a big ocean wave. Finally it is difficult to more along the wave. Third is parkour which is from France. It became popular in the England in 2002. Its training ground is the whole city. These train jump from high building and transform movement in the air. They always want to create new activities like spin flips and so on. To sum up. These sports are daredevil. They are created in modern and people need some energy times.
