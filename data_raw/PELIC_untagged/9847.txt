Hi I'm ANON_NAME_0. I've been dreaming of my own website for a long time. When I began this site it was my first website which I made. Now I've finished several other websites beside this one. Building a website is not as difficult as you think. I've learned about the computer programming language when I was freshmen. It was easier than I thought. I'm not good at them but my first website made me interested in computer language. So I have been studying about ASP JSP language since then. Besides programming I have some other hobbies piano. I've been playing piano for 21 years. I started playing piano when I was 5. In my childhood I've thrown my whole day for piano. It was my dream when I was little but it didn't come true. After many thoughts I've found out a common thing of my interests. It was all related with hands. I think I like doing something with hands.
