I must live in America more than 2 yeays. I sometime think I should have studied English hard when I was a student. However I could improve my English skill if I study hard in ELI. I could have made friends who are native speaker after I came here. But I don't have so I should talk to someone who speak English well. I may have been a nurvous in Japan. So I can't talk to a lot of people. I must have gone to foriegn country when I lived in Japan. I don't have to be changed my personality but I have to try to talk to a lot of people.
