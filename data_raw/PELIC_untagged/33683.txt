I'm talking about my best friend whose name is ANON_NAME_0. She is a English teacher in ELI in which I've participated since last year. The first time I saw her was a Friday when we had a TGIF ceremany. At that time she was talking to the girl who was wearing a yellow skirt. We often talk about questions that I do not understand. She give us who are studying in ELI a lot of help. We equate her with our soul mate.
