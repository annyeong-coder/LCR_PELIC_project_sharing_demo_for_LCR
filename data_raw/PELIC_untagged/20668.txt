My mother has always dreamt of me being a doctor. It was the trend that time every excellent student would be a doctor. As a result everyone in my family anticipated me to become a doctor. While I was growing up my mother's hope transformed from a deam to become a nightmare for me. It was a huge burden I barely could tolerated. In retrospect I feel now I waste my childhood studying instead of playing. However I am gratful for my mother that I'm a hard worker a chracter which help me to achieve whatever dream I have.
