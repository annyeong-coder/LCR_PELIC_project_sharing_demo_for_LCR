When I was ninteen I interrupted my jurisprudential studies because I wasn't covinced of my choice anymore. Waiting to find my way I started to work as a waitress. It was in that period that I discovered my passion for art and particularly for cinema therefore I went back to studing. If I hadn't made this decision I wouldn't have gotten my master degree and now I likely would be working in Italy. Moreover if I hadn't gone back to the university I wouldn't have met my present boyfriend. My boyfriend at that time have been already working for at least five years now. Today I would be probably married with that guy if I had made a different decision. Furthermore for sure if I hadn't attended my postgraduated course I wouldn't have rediscovered my great interest in the English language and most of all I wouldn't be in America now. I'm very happy of my choice. The only negative aspect is that if I had been working for so long time today I would have ran up some money. I wish I could get a job as soon as possible!
