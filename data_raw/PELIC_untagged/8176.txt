My husband and I like many types of sports In general team game or individual sports. For example my husband likes to watch team sport such as baseball basketball American football and soccer. His favorite sport is soccer. He used to play soccer with his friends on the playground after school everyday in his childhood. But now he is so busy working he has no enough free time to play. He continues to play every Saturday afternoon. I just interest in watching soccer game. I like individual sports such as tennis swimming badminton and skiing. I enjoyed swimming this summer and I am going to go skiing this winter. We could see the fun of playing that we each interest in easily. Sports are also good for health. We will be relaxing when we enjoy playing. My husband always tells me If you want to keep your weight and get a nice body you should do a little exercises everyday sport is best way! So I think I could try Yoga at home from now on. Like this sport is very important part of our life.
