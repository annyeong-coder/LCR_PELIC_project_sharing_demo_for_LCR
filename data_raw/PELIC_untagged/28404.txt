It was a big bedroom where I shared with my sister. There was a bunk bed that was my favorite bed in a corner of the room. Across from the bunk bed was a French door which I tidied up per month. Because of dust which the screen window would be covered with if I didn't wash it. My sister whom most of my friends have met and whose desk was next to the bed. She put many books which she was looking at on the desk. And my desk which my father bought was opposite to hers. In front of my desk there was a notice board which we made by ourselves had the shape like a cat. I missed the time when we always studied and did our assignment together.
