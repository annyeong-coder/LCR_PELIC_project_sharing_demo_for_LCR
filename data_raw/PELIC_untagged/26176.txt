Hi Sand I have looked to your story and there was many mistake you have done and I'm here to help you as much as I can. First you should have told him that you in love with him before he left to Minnesota and since that you have the feeling for him it's worth it. Second you had better call him or text him every day if you love him let him always think about you even if didn't call you you dont know what's going on with him in Minnesota. Third if you could visit him go for it and surprise him and he might be in love with you but he couldn't say that while he were around you. Forth you ought to express your all your feeling for him on a paper and then send it by the post mail and wait tell he answer you. About of quiting from your job you had better not to do that before you know what's your position in this situation because he night not have any feeling for you and when you quit from the job you'll lose everything the good salary and the love. All what I can say for you or every one else if you saw someone and you have feeling for him her just invent it don't waste the time by thinking how they will reaction for it. Wish you all the best Sand in your love. Best regards Chatty
