I've lived in Pittsburgh since January 2008. So I've studied in the ELI almost for two semesters. I've gotten an apartment already but I haven't bought a car yet. Every month I visit natural places in Pittsburgh with my family. I've loved natural places since I was child I visited many natural places in my country. I love visit natural places and I haven't stopped yet.
