My little brother Tommy has several annoying habits. For one thing he follows me everywhere. He likes my shadow. I like my privacy but because of Tommy I can never be alone. His most annoying habit is eating with his mouth open. It makes me sick just to have lunch with him. I hope he learn some table manners soon. Another problem is that Tommy leaves his toys all over the house. I am always falling over one of his toy cars or trucks. The house is always a mess with Tommy around.
