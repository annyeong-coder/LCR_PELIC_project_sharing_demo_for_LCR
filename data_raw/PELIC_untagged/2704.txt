Some people are probably more successful in their relationships because they have the qualities essential to loving relationships. The lack of these qualities is probably the cause of many problems if we have with other people. Therefore many of us would benefit from developing those qualities we don't have. For example many people get married and divorced over and over again others don't get along with coworkers on the job. Perhaps their lives would be easier if they were better at communication and more honest about their feelings.
