I met my best friend Sabrina when I lived in France. She was a new student at the University of Toulouse and she was studying law too. She sits next to me while I was taking notes in the course of tax law. She made a lot of noise so I asked her to be more quiet. After the course she decided to invite me in the coffee shop to apologize. We spoke for several hours of our life our purposes our hobbies. . . She was planning to come back in Paris after her fifth years of law in order to pass the entrance examination to the school of lawyers. However she changed a little bit her projects. At present she is in New Zealand where she do woofing. Obviously she wants to improve her English and to acquire more vocabularies before returning to Paris. Sabrina is definitely my best friend. She is sociable determined and hard working. It is for these reasons that I appreciate her!
