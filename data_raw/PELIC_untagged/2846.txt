In my office I am decision maker Most of the times I have to find out the problems then figure out the right solutions Sometimes I have to clear up to my boss why I choose this solution So sometimes he supports me and sometimes he lets me down In my home I am very happy because I am a family man but unfortunately I am not tidy man I just leave my things so my wife has to put away the whole mess She is a helpful person and always tries her best to cheer me and her sons up. .
