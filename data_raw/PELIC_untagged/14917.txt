Hi everybody my name is ANON_NAME_0 which means FOREIGNER in my country. I am writing to introduce myself to all of you. I am here in the USA to improve my English skills. It really takes me a long time to get used to this language. Speaking and Listening is the most difficult part for me. Everybody says I am not patient enough. To study a foreign language takes a lot of time. All of my friends advise me to watch a lot of movies and read books. Usually I like reading books and watching movies but at the moment I do not have enough time. My friends say you're always moaning about what you don't know instead of enjoying what you already know. My hobbies are skiing skating and travelling.
