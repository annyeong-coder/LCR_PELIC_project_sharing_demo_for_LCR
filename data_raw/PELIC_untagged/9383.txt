In my partner's experience he has had a lot of activities. He has been has ever ridden a horse in Egypt because he has traveled there. This has been one of the best experiences of his life. Of course he has ever taken a long trip by car in Saudi Arabia once because he has visited his friends in another city. Moreover he has ever sailed a boat on the sea near Saudi Arabia once. He has often gone camping with his friends in Saudi Arabia. Also he has just seen a shark at Sea World. Actually there are a lot of activities that he has not tried yet. For example he has never tried a hot air ballooning. He has never gone white water rafting. He never tried a sky diving. He has never climbed a mountain. He has never swum in a river. He has been interested in a lot of activities that I told you but he has never tried yet.
