My Definition of Success Most people have their own definition of success. For example earning a lot of money means success to somebody or occupying a high position in company is able to be a final goal of somebody in life. In my case if I feel satisfaction happiness or pleasure about something even if it's a small thing it's success to me. In other words I think the standard of success is self satisfaction and not something like wealth or honor. I don't look for success in far away places and would like to find the meaning of success in places close to me like feeling satisfaction at my job. However my family's opinion of success is different than mine. While I prefer spiritual things like happiness more than others they somewhat tend to pursue wealth or honor. In our country in which I'm living it is similar to the case of my family. People usually want to be famous and make a lot of money. I am likely to believe that the standards of success are wealth and honors. However I realized that if I only chase these things after all I won't be happy. I think that many people pursue wealth and honor for being happy themselves but I could find happiness in my mind not far away places like wealth or honor. I think that we just have a different goal and a different meaning of success in our lives.
