Haste makes waste because every thing needs to be done step by step. If you save some time you will make some mistake. The result will be defeat. You will waste more than time. For example I always want to go fast. But I usually forget something when I am quick. Once my favorite movie was coming on. But I needed to cook. So I decided to cook as fast as possible. I used the strongest firepower and the least water. Finally I finished cooking before the movie started. But my dinner was bad. The outside of the food was burned and the inside was still raw. Also I forgot to add salt. I was very hungry when I was watching the movie. This is a lesson. If you want successful you should not hasten. Haste will waste your time and money.
