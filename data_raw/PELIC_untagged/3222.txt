I think it is good for students to take several short vacations a year for tree reasons. In these days there are a lot of students who are feeling stress from their new school life and new environments. So I think they should be given a rest time in the end of each term. First if there are vacations in each term students can prepare for a next term. They can pre study in the vacation and they can restudy what they did in last semester. Students improve their knowledge or skills by pre study and restudy. Students can also have a free time and they can improve their skills. When they are doing their favorite things they feel happy and free from stress. Second students can go their hometown to meet their families in each vacation. A lot of students live in dormitories or apartments from their families so they don't usually meet their families. Sometimes students miss their families and they cannot feel relaxed. If they can meet their families students feel relaxed with their families and they can have a refresh time. Students can also celebrate holidays with their families and have a happy time with them. Third students can find jobs that they want to do after graduated their college or universities. If students have an only one vacation they couldn't search their jobs and they could not do a personal interview in companies in each vacation. Some companies require a date of interviews so if there is an only one vacation students cannot do their interviews after vacation. It is really important for senior students to find their jobs. In conclusion for these tree reasons students should be given a several vacation a year and they should have a rest and reduce their stress to enjoy their school life.
