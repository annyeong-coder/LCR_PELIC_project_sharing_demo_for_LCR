I am so sorry to hear that! But I have some advices for you that I hope can help you make your decision. At first I have to say that he might love you but he doesn't love you too much. He might not care this relationship if he does he should call you every day and say how much he loves you. But you could call your boyfriend and tell him how much you love him and ask him whether he loves you and whether he wants to get together with you. If he said yes then you should tell him about your job and make a decision together. But don't do that if he said he doesn't love you any more. When he said this he might give you a lot of reasons say why you should not come. If he said no you must to end up this relationship. Another advice is that you should learn to find funny things by yourself. You should learn to fulfill yourself and improve yourself. Then you could meet a better man.
