I like the Korea restaurant. That name of restaurant is Oishie . I think the most important in the life of abroad is food. So when I miss my country food and feel so sad then I usually go there and I'm there I can try to eat some korea food. There are a lot kind of korea food and all foods are delicious. Even though I can not go there very often that is a part of my favorite place in pitt.
