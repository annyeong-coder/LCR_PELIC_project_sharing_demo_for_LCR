I think that the people who go into business for themselves better than the people who take a position in a company and work for the company. When you open a business you have the independence to do any thing with your work otherwise if you work in a company there are some people who force you to do what they want. In addition if you have your own business you can improve your work and increase your money other than if you work in a company you will not improve your job a lot and you will have limit salary. For instance I have two friends one of them open his own business and the second one work in a company my first friend have about three company now because he improved his job year after year but my other friend still in the same company with a limit salary. Therefore I think that for the most part of people prefer to go into business for themselves than work in a company.
