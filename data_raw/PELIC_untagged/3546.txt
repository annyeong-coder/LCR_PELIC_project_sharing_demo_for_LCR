Dear bro Hey JaeHyun! How are you doing I believe that you are doing well with your class. Recently I'm thinking about buying a new cell phone. I want to get your advice because you know a lot about cell phones. I'm trying to decide between a Nokia one and LG one. There are some differences. First I will tell you about the Nokia one. The Nokia one is cheaper than the LG one. Also it does not break easily when I drop it. Most importantly the Nokia one has a good camera and connects to computers easily. Anyway my old phone was a Nokia so I already know how to use the Nokia but the phone that I want to buy is the LG one. The LG one is a better model than the Nokia one because the LG one functions better looks fashionable and is luxurious. Also the touch screen and MP3 player makes the phone very convenient. Even though it is more expensive it is a better phone. Therefore I'm really considering which one is better. Please reply soon. Take care! From
