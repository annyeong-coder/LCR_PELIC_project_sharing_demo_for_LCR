I grow up in my father's house. My family and I cheer up when my father billet it. Every day I came to my house and let in my key in the door. Then I hang up my jacket. After that I pick up a newspaper. Sometime I put on a T shirt. Nest I throw out my crash. But I let down my father when I don't throw out my crash. Usually I go back my house at 4 00pm. Often I leave out my house at 9 pm to meet my friends. I go on with my friends at 12 pm. My father was angry about my grad.
