Everyone likes to speak a foreign language well. To achieve their target students talk about the best way to learn a new language fast. Learning languages depend on speaking and listening skills. I believe that students travel to target language country because traveling helps you to speak with native speakers and listen to native speakers. First traveling helps you to find native speaking friends and to join a conversation group. Living in a foreign country lets you have extra time to go out with your friends and only speak the target language. For example when I study English in my country I don't have enough time to practic. Second traveling helps you to hear the target language everywhere in school in your homestay in resturants and in the street. Listening to native speakers assists you in understanding and learning quickly. For example these days I have been studying in united stats I usually hear and understand people in the street. I think this practice for what I study. Some students may choose to learn a foreign language in their own country. Also some students speak a foreign language without traveling. I understand that learning any language can be frustrating and students prefer staying and studying near their families. I agree that students can speak and achieve a new language from their home. However if they study in their home they will have a lot problems with pronunciation and listening skills. They may learn but they take a long time and they still have problem. In conclusion I think that students should travel to the country where a language is spoken in order to have a good learning by a short time. Students who can travel will find the best way to obtain a foreign language.
