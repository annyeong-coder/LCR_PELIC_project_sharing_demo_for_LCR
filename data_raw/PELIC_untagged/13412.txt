In the past I used to wear uniform and it is convenient for me because I didn't have to worry what should I wear everyday. I didn't use to take bus to go school my Mother used to drive car to take me to school everyday. In my home I didn't use to cook. But know I don't have to wear uniform it is a little problem for me because I have to think what should I wear everyday. And I have to take bus to school and if I miss bus I have to walk to school. It will take me about 30 minutes. Also because I live by myself I have to cook by myself.
