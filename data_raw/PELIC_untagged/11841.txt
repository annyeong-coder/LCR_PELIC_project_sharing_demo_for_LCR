My favorite place to lunch in Pittsburgh is Kivahan. First of all Kivahan is at good location. It is on Craig Street and Forbes. Because of I usually spend my time at University of Pittsburgh and CMU Kivahan is at perfect location to have lunch for me. Furthermore there are many interesting stores around Kivahan so if I have spare time after lunch I could walk around Craig Street and enjoy window shopping also. Secondly it serves great lunch menus such as fresh wraps and paninis. It is a cafe actually so its coffee and tea are fantastic. So I enjoy a cup of tazo hot tea with my lunch sometimes. Moreover it serves customers free wireless internet. Thus I can do my homework or reading internet news with my laptop computer. Finally it has sidewalk seats that let me enjoy people watching and sun. It is really good time to have a delicious lunch in the sun shine. From these reasons I like Kivahan the most.
