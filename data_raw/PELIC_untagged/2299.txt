Analysis of Success First of all success is considered an achievement of self planned goals that in the same time satisfy the individual's expectations needs or demands. Success varies from culture to culture and defines a specific talent. For instance an individual can succeed at work in the family between friends or in a championship. Of course there are some factors to consider that facilitate the reaching of success such as wealth work positions friendships or family. In relation to this allegation I think success is an achievement beyond our regular capacities free of external influences and without any other benefit than honor. Second succeeding needs effort effort needs time and time is the big disadvantage of success because during that time we ignore other activities like work family friends or hobbies. In other words it's almost impossible to succeed in everything. Normally a person is better in one aspect than the other and by focusing in the primary talent it's common to neglect secondary ones. In addition success sacrifices time. Time that could be used to equilibrate the different areas in the daily life of an individual. To conclude I believe success has a sociologic aspect. It is proof of what an individual can do and what is he willing to risk showing his superiority as human being. Society obligates the individual to compete for him to succeed. This can be related to a social and instinctive behavior of survival. Social because it only takes place in the society and instinctive because competing is part of our nature. In other context multiple situations allow the individual to succeed in many ways giving him the opportunity to consolidate his place in society. 278 Words
