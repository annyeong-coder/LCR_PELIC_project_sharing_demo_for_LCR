Nowadays when someone gets old they usually go to live in a nursing center or in a home with other old people where there are nurses to look after them. It is easier for their children to keep them in the nursing center than taking care of them. However old people shouldn't be allowed to go to the nursing center because their children should take care of them also old people like to be surrounded by their families. Old people must be taken care of by their own children. Their own children are the best members that can take care of their old fathers or mothers. Because they know their traits and what do they like and dislike. They have the best qualifications for this job. Nurses may be careless but their children wouldn't be. And as their parents took care of them when they could now their children must return the favor and help them. An old person likes to be surrounded by their family members. In my country the most important member in each family is the grandparents or an old father they should get the full care from their children and stay near the children. And when the old person sees that he is that important he will be self satisfied that he raised good children. And every old person likes it when he plays with his grandchildren and has good time with them. On other hand some may think that old people must be kept in a care center with other old people. They will get along there they will have new friends and they will have fun with each other.
