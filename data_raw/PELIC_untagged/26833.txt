My girlfriend is the most important person for me. I met her at the coffee shop. I was reading and drinking tea and she was smoking hookah. When I was reading she asked me about the book that I'm reading. I gave her the book as a gift. After we talked to each other I took her number. And we met each other again and again. Finally we broke up the relationship but she still the most important person to me.
