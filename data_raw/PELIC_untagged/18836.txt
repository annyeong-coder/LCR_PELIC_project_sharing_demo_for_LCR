What am I planning to do after this semester In the last week of this team I am wondering what I can do in the next one month vocation. I could have plenty of ideas if I were in Beijing because I am more familiar with my city than here. However I already decided to take road test for my driving license on next Saturday and TOEFL exam the week after which do not sound exciting for vocation. Actually I am not a person who is good at vocation planning. When I worked in Beijing I started to have five days pay off holidays in my second working year and increased each year. Normally I would like to combine these five days with National holidays to add up to 10 days in total. I preferred to stay at home with my parents. In my perspective traveling to another place is not a real relaxation. Maybe the reason I like to stay at home is because I do not like to plan my holiday ahead. Back to now I heard some of my classmates decided to go abroad and some of them planned to visit the south of U. S. Comparing with their fabulous plans I would rather to stay in Pittsburgh and discover what I can do in the next one month. If I am lucky enough I may pass the road test and the TOEFL test next month. Then I will ask one of my friends to help me find a used car with considerable price. After having a car I believe I will have more places to visit. Maybe New York will be the next city I plan to visit. Before I decide to travel to another city one thing I should do is to teach my husband how to drive. He had not finished his driving program before he came to the Pittsburgh. Finally I think I have my plan for my vocation passing driving test and TOEFL exam buying a used car teaching my husband how to drive and traveling to New York.
