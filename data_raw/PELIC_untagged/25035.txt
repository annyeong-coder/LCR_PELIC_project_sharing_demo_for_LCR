Becoming a parent which many people look forward to is a special change in life. However being an ideal parent which I believe every parent seeks is hard to attain. As far as I know an ideal parent should set no limits to how much he she intends to serve and take care. The parents who exceed all expectations are those who give and sacrifice infinitely. I have known a parent whose achievements and generosity are out of this world. She took care of her twin daughters who had physical disabilities until one died and the other managed to recover after many years. Another parent whose efforts were also exceptional managed to raise up twelve children on her own until all became men and women. Ideal parenthood doesn't stop at taking care of the children but it goes far beyond that. My grandfather whom I regard as my example in life once said that the best parents are those who dedicate their lives to their children. This which not every parent does would be an unending source of parenthood joy.
