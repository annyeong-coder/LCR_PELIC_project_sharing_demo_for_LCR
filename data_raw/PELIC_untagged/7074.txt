I miss my dogs. I have seven dogs in Paraguay but here in the USA I can't have a dog because I live in an appartment and the management company does not permit a pet. My home in Paraguay has a big yard so for this reason it's easy to have seven dogs!!. Here my appartment is little and I don't have a yard. The next year I'm going to move to a new house and maybe I can bring some of my dogs from Paraguay. If want to do this I have to be sure if is permited to bring pets by airplane. I really I like the idea of not having to miss my dogs!
