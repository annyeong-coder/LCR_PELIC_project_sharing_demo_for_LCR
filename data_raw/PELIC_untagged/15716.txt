I am going to introduce my best friend Ho young. When I was a child I met him in middle school and I think he was very interesting so we got along well quickly. First his height is about 170cm and is not fat. He has a high nose and long ears and he has bad eyesight so he wears classes. Also he usually wears blue jeans and a big T shirt and his hairstyle which looks neat. He is not handsome but When he smile he is cute and lovely and good man. Second I always enjoy the time with him because he can almost describe everyone. When he is doing that we can not distinguish really well. Therefore he has many funny things. So he is most popular among my friends. Finally my best friend will always do his work diligently and I like him.
