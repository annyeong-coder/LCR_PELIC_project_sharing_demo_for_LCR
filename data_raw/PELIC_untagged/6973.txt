My favorite hobby is watching the television. I like it because it offers me many choices. I can watch sports movies news documentaries or other kinds of shows. Also watching the TV commercials helps me know what is new in the market whether it is food tools or services. In addition TV can help people educate themselves by presenting documentaries and talk shows. On the other hand TV may waste someone's time if watching it is not controlled. One must set a goal of what to watch and when to watch it and then must stick to that goal.
