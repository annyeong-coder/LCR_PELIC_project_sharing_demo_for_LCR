Whenever I come in my home after school I feel comfortable. As soon as I turn on the light switch my small apartment becomes a cozy room. This intimate and comfortable atmosphere really cheers me up. However some stuff what is in disorder brings me down quickly. Every morning I make my room messy because I have no time to clean my room before going to school. I easily find out many things to be straightened up. It often bothers me to touch up my messy room. First I hang up my clothes and wash the dishes. Then I take some trash down and straighten up all small stuff. Also I wash the dishes. After doing all of these things finally I can recover my peaceful daily life.
