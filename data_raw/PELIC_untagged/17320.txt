I have a lot of experiences after I came to America. The first experience was cooking. Before I came here I had never cooked Chinese food for myself. I was so surprise that I could cook very well . The second experience was speaking English on the phone. By the time I came to America I had spoken Chinese on the phone. But when I studied here I used English to answer the phone. The third experience was enjoying events. I enjoyed many events after I had come to America.
