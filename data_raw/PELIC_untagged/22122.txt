Eid Alduha I can't believe that I'm going to miss celebrating my wonderful holiday with my family. The special feeling which I feel when I celebrate it and the ability to thank God for all blesses make it wonderful holiday. Every family celebrates this holiday annually on the tenth of the last month in the year and it extends for three days. There are three major activities in Eid Alduha praying sacrificing and visiting relatives and friends. Prayer is performed on the first day in a special way. In the mooring of Eid everybody goes to the assigned area to perform the prayer. Usually every city has two or three areas. After the prayer people sit together and drink Arabic coffee and eat dates. Then they come back to their homes to have the breakfast with their families. Every able man has to sacrifice a goat to God. On the first or second day a goat with special qualities is sacrificed for example the goat must be more at least 8 months old and it should be clear off any illness. Moreover it is preferred to sacrifice more than one goat. The sacrifice must be divided to three parts. The first part for the family the second part for poor people and the third part gift for neighbors. The fabulous part of this holiday is visiting relatives and friends. On the second night families visit other families and have dinner together. In addition some families arrange to have a picnic around their city before two weeks of the Eid. Also friends usually meet together outside of the home and spend the whole day together. To summarize celebrating this holiday is a graceful feeling especially with my family and my friends. Waiting for this holiday every year makes me happily welcome this holyday. I hope I will be able to celebrate it many times in my life.
