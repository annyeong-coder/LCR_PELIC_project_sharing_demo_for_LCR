I lived home alone. Sometimes when I come in the my home I feel like lonely. But usally my home cheer me up. When I moved to my home I didn't have anything. I picked out everything! Even though I run out stuff in my home. My shoeses on the shelf behind the main gate. I picked everything out. So I like it. And when I go to the bed sometimes I forget to turn the light off. After that when I wake up I am in the a bad mood.
