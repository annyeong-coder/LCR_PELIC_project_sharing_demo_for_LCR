You can break up the frequency spectrum in some way whether it's time or frequency or codes so you assign it to users so they don't interfere with each other. There's not enough spectrum to assign every phone in the world its own dedicated channl so we have to reuse the channels and that causes interference between users. Meaning your call is assigned a unique time frequency or code that determines how you access radio frequencies and that keeps your call separated from others. Some amount of time it transmits to the first phone some amount of time it transmits to the second and some amount of time to the third phone and then it comes back to the first phone and because this is going very quickly you don't notice the delay.
