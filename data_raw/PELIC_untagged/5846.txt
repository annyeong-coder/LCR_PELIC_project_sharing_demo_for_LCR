I think that high unemployment rate is the greatest problem in my county. Because of prolonged depression and high expection of the people who find a job this problem is getting worse. As a result every student who is in the last year in the university or who is about to graduate struggles to get a job. Especially the students who just entered the university are forced to prepare for the study which is needed to find a job by their parents
