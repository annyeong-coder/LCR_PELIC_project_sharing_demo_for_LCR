While I was serving the army I met a kind guy. At that time we were fresh so we needed someone who is reliable to each other. During the time we were at army we did many hard work together. A few years later I was studying at the University in Seoul when he suddenly came to me. He told me that if I came to the United States to study English he would willingly help me. He also told me he was already studying at the United States. That was the reason I came here in Pittsburgh.
