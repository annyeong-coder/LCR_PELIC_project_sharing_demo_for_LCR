I remember my grandparents' house where I often visited and stayed when I was a child. When I visited there my grandmother who I really like made delicious meals for us. Nearby the house there is a small stream where I often swam with my relatives. Also there was a big front yard where my relatives and I could play soccer. The house is a little bit far from my home. It took around 3 hours from my home to the house by car. It is a good recollection which I experienced in my childhood. When I go back to Korea I'll visit there.
