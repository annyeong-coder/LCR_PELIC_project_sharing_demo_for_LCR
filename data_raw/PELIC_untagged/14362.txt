My favorite food is vegetable soup because I would like to improve my health. I really want to keep a balanced diet. I'd like to share with you the recipe of vegetable soup. First lightly peel and slice a carrot in four 1cm thick round shapes and boil them. As in the case of the carrot precook a white radish and a potato. Second boil spinach in salted water. Drain and lightly squeeze out of water followed by cutting them into 5cm pieces. Next slice chicken fillets into 2cm and boil them for about 5 minutes. Finally add the carrots the spinach other vegetables and the chicken fillets to the soup and season the soup with soy sauce pepper and salt. Garnish with a lemon peel. It would be plain in tastes and nourishing broth. The soup contains a lot of vitamins and other essential nourishment. I will enjoy good health when I continue eating it.
