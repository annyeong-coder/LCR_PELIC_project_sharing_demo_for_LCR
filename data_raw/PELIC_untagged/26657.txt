I'm one of ELI student. Peter is my Grammer teacher. I live in Pittsburgh since 2008 and I like the weather in Pittsburgh specilly when it is raining. I love the people her they are friendly and helpfull. I like eating at ANON_NAME_0 store the one at Boquat St and sometimes having lunch with yor friend at Panera Bread will be a good idea. I'm planning to study at University of Pittsburgh next semester if I get accepted for Master Degree of Public Health I'm so exited to start studing at PITT.
