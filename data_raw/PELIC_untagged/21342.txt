This semester I have enhanced a lot of things such as grammar pronunciation and scanning of reading. For example I was always confused grammar structures however I have clarified that grammar is very rational expect preposition. Now I can use diverse ways of grammar. My speaking teacher corrects my pronunciation frequently so I can pay attention during speaking. Thus I have cultivated my problems of pronunciation which are L and R sound. Last semester I was not good at reading. However this semester I enjoyed reading. I attribute those reinforcements of my English to ELI program. Next year I will go to Canada for a year. Fortunately I got a working holiday visa which I can work what ever I want. Not only do I pursue my study but I also retain that I have learned at ELI.
