Welcome to my website! I'm ANON_NAME_0. If you are difficult to pronounce my name just call me Julia. I had lived in Seoul when I moved in Pittsburgh. Now I have been living in Pittsburgh for study English since 2006 December. I've made this website to write my experience here. I've posted a lot of photos and gathered valuable articles about my interesting field. I hope you enjoy them. When I lived in Seoul I worked for Korea Telecom and I did not have enough time to enjoy my life. However I have enjoyed a lot of activities since I stopped my job and moved in Pittsburgh. I have been learning how to play tennis for 3 month. Last month I learned how to use forehand. Also this month I learned to use volley maybe I finished volley because it was easy. On the other hand I've learned to use backhand probably I will learn how to use backhand again. It is difficult to use backhand. In addition playing tennis is very interesting but sometimes it is dangerous. At first time I got accident when I played tennis. When my coach threw a ball to me I was running due to hit the ball but I slipped and I've laid for a few minutes. As a result my knee bled and bruised. The bruise has still remained on my knee although it happened 3 month ago. However I love tennis because it helps me keep my health and give opportunities to talk with my neighbors.
