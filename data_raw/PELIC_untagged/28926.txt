Dear SAND Thank you so much for your letter. You really meet a problem but there is no need to worry because it is a common problem which usually happens between lovers. I believe this relationship is very crucial to you so I think you should grasp it and don't let it run away. In my opinion you ought to go to visit your boy friend although he hasn't mentioned it since he moved. It is because he had told you his idea before he left and now he is waiting for your reaction and he does not want to push you and disturb your life. All of this can prove that he loves you greatly and has faith for your relationship. Another thing you should do is to ask your company whether you might get a chance to be dispatch to a branch which locates in Minnesota. If you work in Minnesota you can not only live with your boyfriend but also keep your good job. On the other hand if your company does not have any branch in Minnesota you had better quit from it because you are unhappy without your boyfriend. Also you can get high salary in this company which means your ability should be good enough to find another excellent job with high salary in Minnesota. If you think your boyfriend is the most crucial part of your life you should move there definitely. Bless you. Yours Sincerely Chatty
