The first thing we can learn from Caral is Caral had served as a major trade center for the region. Shady found necklaces of smail and the seeds of the coca plant which did not come from Caral so we know the rich trading environment and the fact that there were elite grades who did not work for producing food so it could be a proof of urban society emerged. Second what sustained such a trading center was not food. The early farmers in Caral redirected area rivers into trenches and canals to bring water to their fields. Last she found that the farmers of Caral grew the cottn that the fishmen needed to make the nets and the fishermen gave them shellfish and dried fish in exchange for these nets. These trading made the resources of the sea more readily available.
