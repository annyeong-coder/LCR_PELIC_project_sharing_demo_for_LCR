The movie I loved is Twilight. Twilight is the popular movie not only in the U. S. But also almost all countries around the world. It is a romantic movie gaining a lot of money when it was showed. It is a film about a vampire named Edward who is falling in love with human named Bella. Bella moved from Arizona where the weather is quite warm to Forks located in Washington where is the weather quite wet. At Forks school where they had the first met Edward acted as he did not like Bella. In fact he already fell in love with her since he met her. After they had chance to get to know each other they fell in love. However it is not accepted for humans to fall in love with vampire so Bella decided to keep it to be a secret from her father who is a policeman and her mother who is re married. Moreover he cannot depart from Edwards whom she fell in love with. It had many problems and obstacles that could prove their true love. One of the big problems happened when they were facing James who is a vampire whose wife name Victoria wanted to drink Bella blood because she had great smell blood. For this reason Edwards tried to protect her as many ways as he could do in order to safe his girlfriend's life so he decided to stop James action by burning him where he confined Bella.
