ANON_NAME_0 Student's Last Name Writing 4 October 14. 2008. Compare There are three similarity and differences to compare and contrast between two co workers I had worked with them. There named ANON_NAME_1 and ANON_NAME_2 so there were three differences such as how they used to come on time how they used the lunch time and how they were useful. There were similar because their used to write by the right hand also they were wear glass when they read and they had have Toyota cars. Ail use to come to work on time because he is thinking the work is more important and he knows if he comes late his managers will be anger and he will not promote to another level in the other hand ANON_NAME_2 always comes late because he is very lazy and he does not care about his future and his manager always got anger for him. They were using them lunch time on different ways. They have an hour a day to eat them lunch one hour ANON_NAME_1 had eaten his lunch less than an hour and he know he has to return to his work but ANON_NAME_2 he takes more than one hour because after he ate his lunch he always go to smoke cigarette and he takes more time they gave him. ANON_NAME_1 more useful when he does his work because usually he finished more than 100 document daily because he use his time correctly but ANON_NAME_2 does not finished more than 45 a day because he did not use his time correctly and also he is very lazy. After we compare between ANON_NAME_1 and ANON_NAME_2 how is better co worker and how more useful time come is on time and how use time at the better way we found ANON_NAME_1 is is better than ANON_NAME_2.
