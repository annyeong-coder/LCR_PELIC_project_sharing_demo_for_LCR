My name is ANON_NAME_0 Last Name . Some of my friends call me Attin. I'm from in Japan. I'm studying English in Pittsburgh because I want to become a nurse in here. I have a nursing license of Japan. Actually I was working as a nurse in Japan during nine years. I absolutely love this work. I'm doing my best to keep up my spirits on a cold for my dream come true.
