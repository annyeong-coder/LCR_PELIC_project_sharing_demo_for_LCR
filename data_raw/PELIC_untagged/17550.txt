Education is very important in Korea. In my country there have a proverb that says education have to be made plan that think after one hundred years. As the article almost koreans believe education is not just teaching and it can make more to be well. I agree with it. Because Korea does not have underground resources. In addition it is not large like America. So koreans have to develop industry by education. As a result the teacher is respected in my country. This is reasons why education is very important in korea.
