Who I was and who I am I was a very terrible student when I studied in the primary school. Playing a lot and refusing to finish homework I was blamed by my teachers as well as my parents all the time. The reason I did not pay attention to my study was because the teachers did not think I could study well. Until one day my mother told me that I should not study for my teachers but for myself. After that I changed my study attitude. When I was studying in the middle school I made new friends who did not know my previous study records. Therefore I thought it was a good opportunity to change myself to a good student. Therefore I have been a good student since I graduated from primary school. Neither my teachers nor my parents could believe that I completely changed to a good student. But I really have done it. One of my best teachers told me that I need to believe myself. This sentence encourages me all the time. In my spare time I like playing badminton with my friends or walking with my dog. After moving to Pittsburgh I have not been seeing my dog for a long time. Even if my parents can hold my dog in front of the video camera to let me see her I have still missed her. Now I have been living in Pittsburgh for a while. I have been eating sandwiches instead of fried rice for lunch since I started taking ELI program in the CL. Moreover I have cooked for my husband since we left China. Now I am a good student and a good housewife.
