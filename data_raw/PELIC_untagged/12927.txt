The Problem of the Brazilian Slums One relevant problem that Brazil is facing nowadays is the absence of housing to the poor people and the intense growing of the slums. This is a very complex problem because is caused by many different aspects of Brazilin socio politic organization. The main characteristic that defines the Brazilian slums is the irregularity of the construction. This means that everything that is constructed in the slum from the streets to the housing is not approved form the government and even the land do not belong to the real dwellings. Building more subsidized housing and starting a program of urbanization in the existing slums are two possible solutions for this problem. Built more subsidized housing is a solution that fight against the increasing of the problem once that the perspective of this reality is to keep growing more and more each year. In this matter the government the private sector and the communities have to join their forces to propose new forms of housing and more important affordable once. This way a possibility of acquiring a house will appear and the possibility of living in a slum will be no longer a option to this people. Making a big program of urbanization in the existing slums is a solution that should come together with subsidized housing. Once that is not enough money to build all houses that is needed a way of solving this problem is to take advantage of the existing housing and regulate them. An urbanization program would make the slums be more integrated to the city as providing urban infra structure facilities public transportation and more important a property of the plot and the house. Those solutions should go together. Dalia Last Name
