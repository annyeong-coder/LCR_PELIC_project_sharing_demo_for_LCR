I love him so much. Now I am going to locate my mom. My mom is the woman who are wearing a purple blouse and has a dark hair. She is so special. I love her so much. Also My mom who did the party to me is my best friend. The last people I will talk about is my dad. He is a guy who are wearing a pink shirt and is beside a guy who wear beard. My dad who pays my all study has a good heart and I love him so much. The last thing I am going to talk about is The Guarana. The Guarana that is green and is located on the table is a soda from Brazil. The Guarana that you can buy in Giant Eagle is so delicious.
