This day I would like to tell you about my interesting friend named Apolqasm . He has graduated since 1996. He has gotten MA in physics since 2003 . He has loved physics since he was ked. He has married since 2002. He his lived in the US for six months . He hasn't a car since he moved to the US . He has paid the rent for six months. Maybe after six months he will move to university of Kent to complete has Ph. D . He is so lucky because he has great teacher and she gives him a little home work.
