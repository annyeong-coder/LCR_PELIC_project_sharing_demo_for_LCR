My classmate likes to do exciting sports. First of all she's ridden a horse four months ago. She traveled Jeju Island in her country. There are many horses. She wants to try to ride the horse. Next she doesn't like to travel a long time. She is lucky because her country is small. She's just traveled for seven hours. But her country doesn't have a big mountain . There are small hills. That's why she's never climbed a mountain. Then she's sailed a boat on the Han River in her country. Also she's swum in this river. Han River is so long. The river divides Korea into two areas. I've never been to Korea but now I want to go there. Finally she hasn't gone camping lately. She's just come to Pittsburgh. She is busy as a bee. .
