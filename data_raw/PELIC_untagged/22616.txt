A book that is one of my favourites is The Fair Woman. It was written by Sandor Marai a Hungarian novelist who was born at the beginning of the 20th century. The book tells the same story from three different points of view. In the first part a lady tells to her friend everything about her husband who abandoned her for another woman. In the second part the husband tells to his friend everything about the woman for whom he abandoned his wife. In the third part the other woman with whom the man was having an affair tells to her new lover how her relationship with that man failed. The three characters tell different details which can make you believe that all of them are talking about different stories. No one is lying they are just telling the story from their point of view.
