Last Saturday I was at home bored and thinking of doing something fun and my friends called me to hang up. I had kept on studying all day and needed to get some fun. I hung up the phone to consider whether to go or not. I will call back to tell them that they picked up at 9 pm. The bar was by reservation so that one of my friends had signed previously. We had an incredible night and end up eating pizza. I woke up with a hang over.
