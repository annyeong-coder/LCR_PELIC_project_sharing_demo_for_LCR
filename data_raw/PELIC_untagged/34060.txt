My life has really changed a lot in the past few months. Three months ago I lived in Riyadh. Lately I have lived in Pittsburgh. Last year I worked at Saudi Telecom Company. This year I have been a student in the ELI at the University of Pittsburgh since May. I played volleyball in Saudi Arabia. For the past two months I have played tennis.
