HI I'm ANON_NAME_0 . I've been living in america since 2006. I've been building this website for a while. And I almost done. I've written this page to introduce my self. I've often been work hard. I grew up in al ahssa saudi arabia. And my family did adventure sports like diving. I've been working on bachelor's dgree since 2006 in pitt. Since I moved to pitt. I've learned how to dive. This month I've already completed two dives. And I have a social life too. Actually last month I got engaged to fantastic woman. I've been thinking to bring her here to live together. She hasn't been sea diving. But she wanted to try it once. Thankyou
