Flow is immersion or the mental state what is immersed in or absorbed in something. It needs to feel pleasure and develop creativity. When I was a graduate school I had experienced flow. When I worked in the laboratory my junior in school called me. But I didn't realize to call me. I was focusing on running an important project. As a result I had completed that project successfully because I was in flow. I believe that school doesn't need to be organized to create flow. It is up to students to create flow. Students can reach the flow state by trying to focus something on their own. To create flow immersing in something by oneself is more important than teaching flow in school.
