If I had been born in the USA I would be a native speaker English and I would never need to take the TOEFL test. It sounds good for me. On the other hand If I had not lived in Libya I could have never known about this great area of world. In addition If I had been American I would have took a stand against the American war on Iraq. Moreover if I had learned in the US schools I should have had a phd now.
