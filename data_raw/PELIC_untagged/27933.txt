A few months ago my mother told me that Bobby one of dogs my parents live with had died of old age. Before dying he had looked always calm and happy even though he had been blind and had not been able to go out. My mother said that he was dead peacefully. Sometimes I learn something from animals. Maybe the reason why the author of this essay wrote about an innocent animal and children is because they seem preternaturally endowed with an inner sense of the world's essential sacredness. They transcend every kind of prejudice and bigotry so they have healing power that helps those who suffer from old wound like the author. I sympathize with this old man and I think he feel free from guilt and helplessness haunting him for a long time.
