Beef is my favorite meal. I started playing tennis a week ago. I put too much salt in the dish today. I haven't had my hair cut for a long time. Could you give me some advice to improve my English Yesterday I bought two kilos of beef. There are three groups of Japanese. I put a grain of sugar in my dish. I was very depressed in a period of time. My mother works in a branch of government.
