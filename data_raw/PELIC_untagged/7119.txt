I like to be with friends who are honest with me. I think friendship has to have faith towards to each other. Friendship which contains faith won't change easliy. I love the kind of people who are funny. I also like to have friends whose personality is good. Actually my best friend is the one who has good personality. When I was in 8 grade I met my best friend who is really nice and kind. We are still best friends. It is not going to be change.
