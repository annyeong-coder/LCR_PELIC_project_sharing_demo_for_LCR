I am the one who has an intuition. Let's look on my experience March 2007 before I came tho Pittsburgh I had planed to study abroad started with English classes and enrolled a MBA program. At that time it was some sound in my brain which said You should get the TOEFL and GMAT scores before go to study the MBA program at the US but I did not pay attention on that sound. I have been in Pittsburgh for almost two years. I wish I had studied in the MBA program after my first year in here. Now I have stuck on the English course not yet shifted to the MBA program. I wish I had gotten the TOEFL and GMAT scores before I came to the US.
