A few days ago I had an interesting experience at Giant Eagle. I had little food at home and went there to buy some. There were a lot of people this day. I thought that I had enough money to buy the food I wanted. I used to pay everything by cash and I had never used my debit card before for that kind of purpose. However after computing the agent told me the amount I should pay. That was a lot more than what I expected. Because there were many people behind me and my English is not so good to talk much I was scared. I had to pay quickly and left the line for other people. Then I got the idea to use my debit card for the first time. I asked the agent how to use it and she showed me. So I was able to pay. Now I wanted to understand why the amount was too much. I found out that one expensive item was considered twice. I told the agent that her computation was wrong and she accepted. I went to the customer service and they gave me a little money back. Since then I check the amount they charge me each time I buy things there. Anyway it was a great experience where I learned at least how to use my debit card to buy things.
