The technology is getting to be developed as the time goes by. After Industrial Revolution a lot of inventions are created by people and they are used as many ways often in our lives. In schools we can see using them easily around us. Now some of people think that might not have to come to class and study at home using technology. What are the effects of this if it could be possible The first one is that every students can handle technical ones that they provide for their study. These such as a computer or a radio or etc should be essential for students to study. So they can provide these things from the government or schools or communities which they belong to The second one is that parents don't have to worry about the dangerous of school life. In traditional school sometimes relationships with friends causes big problems. For example fighting with friends doing bad things to weak students. If it's too much it might be a treadgy both of students. They don't have contact in person in the real life if we study at home it could happen less than before. The last one is a bad side that student will not adapt the society easily. The school is a kind of small society. In traditional school student can learn how to make relationships with people and cope with some situation they have. By experiencing them students are growing up and learning how to live in the future when they are in the big society. However studying at home can not provide this education. Excepting those three ones there are a mountain of effects students might have. We can not judge which way of education system is right or wrong but we should consider any kinds of effects when we take the way to study at home using technology .
