My name is JaeHoon ANON_NAME_0. In my country my friends usually called me jae ko. Ko means nose in Korean. Because I have a big size nose they are calling me like that funny combined nickname. I have huge interests in sports especially soccer. But soccer is not famous in U. S so I'm trying to have interests in football. Furthermore football team in Pitt is famous for their great ability so It's very excting because I like the winner. And I'm planning on treveling from the eastern part of U. S to the western part after this semester. It's very important part of whole plan in U. S and the big chance to get great experiences. And It also important for my dream being a good architect. Because the architect need not only the drawing skills but also experiences from as many parts as possible.
