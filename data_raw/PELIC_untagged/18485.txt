If I went to a dessert island with three tings that I can bring I would bring water a book and a dog. I must bring water to survive in the dessert island. I have heard people can be alive for only three days without water therefore water is essential in the dessert island. The book is also important thing. Life in the dessert island makes me tired. So I have got to choose the book. I might change last one but now I consider bringing a dog. I think a dog is better than my peer because a dog never complain in difficult situation. So I don't have to argue with my dog. I also want to bring my parasol but I can't because I already chose three things.
