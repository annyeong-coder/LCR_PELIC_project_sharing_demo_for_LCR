A year ago I was trying to make new friends in Pittsburgh because I live in this city and I didn't have any at that time. Fortunately I met my friend Afnan who is from she Saudi Arabia like me. I met her in the ESL classes at Duqesne University while we were waiting for the next class that we were taking together. She is very important to me because we have many habits in common and because we understand each other. We spend most of our free time together doing many things which we missed doing with our friends in our country. Also we help each other in any difficulty we face in our expatriation in the United States. According to that we learned many new things from each other as we were sharing our opinion. We didn't know that our friendship will go this far but we are happy now with fact that we became sisters and we love everything we do together. In addition we always plan to meet when we go back home since we live in different cities there. I am so glad that I got to know her ans I hope we stay friends forever.
