At the begging of 20th century there were few schools in the country in fact in the past there is no funding from the government to the education the funding came from richer private citizens the government took the control of it in 1940's. There are huge differences between the education system in the past and the present of you can say the difference before and after the oil. In the last few decades there is no schools the boys go to the old man house called Motawa and the girls go to the old women house called Motawaa the education was limited to the teaching of the Holy Quran or the three basic reading writing and simple math at that time did not require more than that. In this time before discover the oil there are the establishment of the first school in Kuwait in 1911 and the second school 1921. The education system now a days is very different especially when the government took control the system is dividing to many levels the first one is Kindergarten for Kuwaiti children between the ages four and six. After that Elementary school and Intermediate and High school and if you want to continuo your higher education you have two choices even Kuwait University or Public Authority Applied Education and Training. The development not just when they dividing the levels but also when they change the teaching system for example in these days children they start to learn English and computer science since they six years old and also they learn about every thing like science geography Arabic Art. The both education system in the past and now free for Kuwaiti people until they graduated from the university most of the people send their children to government school unless if they want their children in forging schools like American or British or French school.
