I have been at some restaurants in the USA since I came here. Sometimes I go out with my family and sometimes with my friends. I remember when I arrived to the JFK airport and I was waiting with my family for the next flight which goes to Pittsburgh. During this time we went to the TG Fridays restaurant and we ordered three meals which each one contained one grilled chicken sandwich and some French fries and one glass of drink. We enjoyed there but something had been happened which make me remember this restaurant. When we went back to the gate before a half of hour for the liftoff the gate had been closed that result we missed the flight. One day of the summer I went with my friend to cake chesses restaurant in the morning then we ordered two dishes of omelet some breads two cups of coffee and some chesses. But we found something surprise us. That was the omelet contained some sausages and the sausages were mixed with some bacons. However we are not allowed to eat bacons we asked the waitress to change those omelets and she did. The last meal I had at restaurant was last night. I went with my family to the Olive Garden then we ordered one dish pasta three sodas some salads and some bread. Those kinds of food were very delicious. We enjoyed there.
