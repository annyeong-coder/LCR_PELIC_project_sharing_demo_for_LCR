ANON_URLSPAGE_Most people prefer to use their cars than to walak. According to Andrew Furman the reason for that is not because cars are comfortable and people become lazy but the reason is there is no nice places to walk through. In Europe there are beatifull places in old cities. However modern cities and suburbs in North America force pedestrians to walk in boring routes. But imagine if you could walk through interesting areas like art exhibit or green spaces the people start loving walk which is good.
