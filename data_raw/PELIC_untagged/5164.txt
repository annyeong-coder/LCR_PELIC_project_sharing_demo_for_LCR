I used to play soccer when I was in middle school. But since then I have played basketball. I have been playing basketball with my best friends so far. I have learned how to ski from my father for seven years. However I couldn't go skiing during two years because I had gone the military by 2006. Actually this year I went to the Hidden Valley in Pittsburgh with ELI teachers and friends. It was really fun. After finishing the military I have enjoyed playing ping pong even though I disliked playing ping pong before.
