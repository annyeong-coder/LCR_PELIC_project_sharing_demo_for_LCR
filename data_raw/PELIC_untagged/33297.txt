First of all always being sad may makes you lose your confidence. People will not be successful if they are not confident. Thus it will be another sadness when they fail in something. For instance I have a Chinese friend who is poor at Chinese writing. So every time we had to write he felt very sad because he thought he would get a low score again. With this negative implication in his mind he hadn't any confidence to improve his writing skill. Therefore he just gave up thinking and got a low score in the end and then became more and more inconfidence. It's really a negative cycle isn't it Moreover sadness may causes health problems. Always being sad is a kind of mental problem. Patients who are with this mental problem never smile because they can only see the negative aspects of one thing all the time. However a scientific study also shows that mental problems are easy to cause physical problems because once a person has many negative emotions their immunities will be decreased a lot. . That means sadness will not only affects people's mental health but also makes people unhealthy in physically. If we lose our health it will be absolutely a biggest sadness! My grandma once was told that she had a cancer when I was 15. So she was sent to the hospital and had an operation. After the operation my grandma was positive and never thought about the harmnessess of the cancer. However the woman stayed next to her was so sad and never went out to meet the sunshine. Nowadays my grandma is still very healthy and the disease never hurt her while the other woman is still stay in the hospital. Last but not the least sadness may sometimes leads to bad relationships with others.
