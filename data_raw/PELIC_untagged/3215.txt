The apartment where I live is nice and sunny. I like my living room where I can relax and watch TV with my family. There are a lot of things in it. There is TV. Next to big couch where I watch movies. There is a window that the sun shines come from through it in the morning. Beside the living room there is dinner room where I eat my meals everyday. The apartment's door that has two locks is next to the TV. I like to set in this room with my family who came with from my country all time.
