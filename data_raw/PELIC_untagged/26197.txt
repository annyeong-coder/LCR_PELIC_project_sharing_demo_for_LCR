According to Yueh ANON_NAME_0 ANON_NAME_1 stereotypes are starting points to understand other cultures social groups and individuals who belong to them. From my own experience I can say that this can be true sometimes. I have a lot of Russian friends and one thing I noticed about them is that they can be very changeable depending on their mood. I had a Russian classmate at high school. She was a really nice girl but she had a very difficult character. One day I was sitting in the classroom waiting for my teacher to come when my classmate entered the room. I said hi to her but she didn't even look at me. I was really upset that day thinking that maybe I did something wrong. The next day she came to the class and started to talk to me as if nothing happened. I asked her what was the matter with her and she replied Oh I was just in a bad mood . I walked away. I tried to justify her behavior but I couldn't. I was thinking why people hurt others just because they are in a bad mood. We all face difficulties and we all have problems but that doesn't mean that we should demonstrate our bad mood to others. Anyway she came up to me saying that she was very sorry. Of course I forgave her but after our conflict we both knew how to treat each other. Now we are friends but in order not to have conflicts anymore we use some tricks If I call her and realize that she is not in a good mood I just tell her to call me back. And the same with her. She just tells me that she is busy and that she will call me later. Since that conflict I haven't had any problems with my Russian friends. I know that this is the way they are and I just don't pay attention. Even though I still feel uncomfortable when they show me their bad mood I know that they don't mean to hurt or offend me. This is just the way they are.
