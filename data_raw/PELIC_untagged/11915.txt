A lot of garbage is generated every day. These garbage triggers pollution of the environment. It is the most important thing to how to dispose of garbage for every country. We need to find some effect and useful ways to depose them such as recycle and reuse them. For example when I lived in German one of things was surprised that a plastic bottle of cost is more than a bottle of water. You must pay the deposit of bottle for store. The store is required by law to recycle bottles. A bottle of deposit is 25 cents but a bottle of water price is 19 cents. So people like to return bottles to get back their deposit. It is a good way to recycle and reuse garbage.
