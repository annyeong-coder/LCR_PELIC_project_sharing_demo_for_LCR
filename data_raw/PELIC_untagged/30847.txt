Hasan Albarqi October 21 2011 Writing 5S Weekend is the best thing that happens for employees and student. Starting from Friday until Sunday you have to enjoy your life but there are many differences and similarities between Friday and Sunday. The differences are about working and shopping and the similarity is having fun. First working is different between Friday and Sunday. On Friday when I hear its Friday I become happy I don't know why but I think it is related to emotional after hard week work and I stop every things because this is the time for fun and I can do what I want but without violate a law. On Sunday it is the time to start doing homework clean my home and clothes also go to supermarket to get some foods and finally relaxation. Second the similarity between Friday and Sunday is still I have time for fun. On Friday I have all night for fun go to see an exhibit hang out with my friends go to malls to see new fashion and play soccer. Also on Sunday I still have time for fun. I can do homework and all necessarily work at home in the morning. After that I have whole day to do what I did on Friday. In conclusion Sunday and Friday are the best on the week but there are some differences and similarities between them. The differences are related to working and shopping and the similarity is having fun. I hope that Friday and Sunday are the days of whole week. I think all people become happy.
