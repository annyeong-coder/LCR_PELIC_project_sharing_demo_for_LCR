In my opinion nothing but spruce trees mounded with snow a vast and enclosing mosaic etched solely in grays and whites is the most descriptive from the reading. Especially spruce mounded vast and enclosing mosaic etched solely in grays and whites are very descriptive. I think these words describe the landscape very apparently.
