In my home I sometimes feel bad and unconfortable against my husband because he's always leaving his clothes on the floor and he doesn't put away his tuff. His behavior like a child let me down. Since I got married I have been telling him what he shoud do after he used stuff such as toothpast a comb and the stationery. He has been counting on me inside a house so I have to take care of everything for him. I used to be willing to look after him but I found out that it was not good for him. So I started to point it out to him to put away his stuff everytime he forgot it. It is as if I'm bringing him up as my son. Futhermore he ofetn asks me what he will wear before he leaves home. It's not my business but I pick out his clothes from his closet reluctantly. I sometimes feel like giving up taking care of him. Actually I made up some of the paragraph to carry out this homework.
