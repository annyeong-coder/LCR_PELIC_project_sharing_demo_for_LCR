Cari Safina talked about the Gulf and oil spill. He studies the sea bird and now he is writing a book how the ocean is changing. All of burning oil coal and gas affect and change the atmosphere. Also people who live around the Gulf are aquatic people. People and kids use the beach while people are cleaning it. Oil affects animals under the water and the plant growing slowly. Also the fishing is going down. Booms are mixed the oil with water when they pass through the oil. He refuses acknowledge this issue by accident and he wish that no spill will happen in future.
