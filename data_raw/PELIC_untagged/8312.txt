The worst meal that I have ever had it was made by me. I was in U. S. And I was excited with the idea of cook my boyfriend's favorite dish and I tried to cook Chicken Marsala. At first glance cooking the dish seemed easy but I had to face some trouble when I was cooking and it was a mess. First of all I bought the worst Marsala wine that I could find. The smell was awful and it never blended with the rest of the ingredients. Second I needed corn starch to make heavier the sauce but I did not find it in the supermarket. Because by the time I cooked I did not know what was the name in English and I was looking for Maizena Corn starch's name in Spanish . So my sauce seemed water and of course the flavor was very different. Finally I was not happy with the flavor but I wanted to impress my boyfriend. So I was preparing everything to make a nice presentation of the food when I fell down on the floor with one of the plate and I lost the food. I started to cry because I did not have anything else for dinner and I felt very frustrated. However when my boyfriend came over my home he brought a bottle of wine and flowers and he cheered me up. After that we went to a beautiful Italian restaurant and we had a delicious and glamorous food. I had pasta with salmon and he had his Chicken Marsala.
