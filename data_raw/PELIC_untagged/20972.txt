Why the drinking age should or shoul not be lowered to 18 The reason why I am interested in this topic is based on a lot of bad events caused by young people's drinking. When I saw their families' grief and their death by drinking problems of the young throughout TV and newspapers I have begun to strongly believe and support that we have to retain the law that young people under 18 can't buy and drink alcohol. Physically their body isn't well developed in that their bodies are not enough to purify alcohol like adults. So they might be easily affected by some side effects such as brain damage and other organs' damage unlike adults. Also mentally they are lack wisdom and ability that they can think reasonably after drinking. Compared to adult because they have more tendency to show their unstable emotion and impulse the invisible dangers such as drinking car accident and impulsive theft are waiting for them.
