I asked some students in the ELI some questions about why chose ELI and any new information about it. First question why do you think the ELI is a good place to study Hanan Elajaili said Because it has excellent teachers and staple program. Second question why would you recommend the ELI other students Hanan Elajaili said It has strong program and has many advantage. Third question what do you think are the strengths of the ELI ANON_NAME_0 said It has good teachers the class it's very small it helps and good to me to contact my teachers ELI is locating at Pittsburgh and it has good benefits. Forth question why did you choose the ELI at Pitt over other schools ANON_NAME_1 said Because ELI has five classes every day another schools don't have like this system and has many activities and I find many to help me in this institute. Finally I discovered All the student consolidate the ELI it's very strong.
