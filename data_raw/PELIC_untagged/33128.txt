This semester I have decided to organize my studying habits. Initially I have planned a scheduled study time for all the courses in order to achieve my goals . After that I have been writing the new vocabulary on cards and I have been reviewing them regularly. Also since May I have been practicing the language with native speakers. On the other hand I have not prepared for TOEFL so far. Although learning networks are effective means of language acquisition I have not joined one yet. Setting a schedule for learning English has helped me a lot to improve my language. For example as we have started learning the core vocabulary I have written many paragraphs with them. Also I have been trying to correct my grammar while speaking. I have been recording my speaking and I have asked one of my friends to evaluate it. Since I have moved to Pittsburgh I have been reviewing my schoolwork over the weekends and this has helped me a lot to be ready to acquire new knowledge. Moreover I have been revising the notes that I have taken previously which have assisted me to get good marks in the quizzes. However It have been said that note taking is a key factor of effective learning but unfortunately I have been trying hard to take notes on some movies that I have watched. It is obvious that I need to spend more time on practicing note taking as well as reading the strategies of note taking.
