I have been quietly influences by one friend of mine Takao. I met him in Florida when I started to study English in United States. I am still inspired by his attitude to study especially by the way he attempted to achieve his goal in United States . When he came to Florida he could hardly speak in English although he had made an effort to study English everyday. He tried to talk with native speakers even though he could not understand what they said totally. Finally he could go to graduate school and his English skill was considerably improved. Thus I am invoked by him to study my major in United States and his influence can be seen in my study approach. I was thought by my university professor Dr. Takahashi to study my major in United States. When I hoped to take advanced education in my major he recommended me studying abroad because he had studied business management in United State. While I worked in Japan I was thinking about studying abroad then I frequently consult with him about my future. Then I was helped by him to choose school and to deal with some troubles in United States. Thus I respect him and I was thought by him to stay here. My boss will always be remembered by me for business behavior. He was my directly boss and he was always taking care of his followers. When some follower failed in his matter my boss always tried to solve problems with him and my boss frequently apologized to business partner in stead of him. Moreover I consulted with him in my business plan he advised me to make decision of it accurately. Therefore he can be respected by me to conduct in social activity and can be of reference to my ideal manager.
