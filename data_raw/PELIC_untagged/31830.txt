Modern technology has been improved in the last twenty years. A lot of changes during those years have made people's lives easier than before. One of these technological changes is cellphones. Cellphones have helped society in many ways. First of all since cellphones have become popular to most people around the world lives have become more convenient. For example fifty years ago when someone moved away from his her family for studying or living purposes it was difficult for him her to find a way to contact his or her family or friends. Now in these days it is very easy to contact people regardless where do they live. The thing that you need to do is just to press a few buttons and talk through your phone. Another thing is some phones which are called smart phones have many advantages rather than just call family or friends. For example they have Internet services. Some people need to work in the Internet most of their time. This kind of cellphone gives people the chance to use the Internet even they are outside their homes. Although cellphones have helped people and have made their lives better some people say that cellphone have some disadvantages. For example they say that cellphones cost a lot of money but I think no one is able to move away from his her family for several years without call them. To sum up cellphones have improved people's lives and they made people seem close to other even if they live thousands of miles far away.
