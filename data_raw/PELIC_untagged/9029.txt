My father is a fashionable man. His hair is dark and curly. He always sets his hair by himself looks so neat. He is not very tall men but his medium height and average weight just fit his personality. He wears glasses looks like a teacher. He likes to dress suits when he goes to work. Also he always has a warm smile on his face so he is a charming man. My father is not only fashionable he is also responsible. He loves his job loves our family. When I was a little he always worked too late in company so he left me with the impress of his tireless work. But he will help my mother to do some homework at weekend also will teacher me and my sister playing some sports game such as badminton table tennis and swimming if he has some free time. Of course he is strict with us about our study. He is good father. The most praiseworthy that my father is a punctual person he is also known for keeping his promise. I very respect him for this part. I love my father.
