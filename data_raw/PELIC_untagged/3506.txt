I would like to have conversations with you. I don't want to lose my old friend. You MUST GIVE UP smoking. If you smoke a lot you will lose your health. You OUGHT TO REALIZE that you are not single. You SHOULD TAKE moderate exercise. When we were students we often went mountain climbing. You were active person who enjoyed discussing with friends. You HAD BETTER TALK with them and FIND problems which you felt angry.
