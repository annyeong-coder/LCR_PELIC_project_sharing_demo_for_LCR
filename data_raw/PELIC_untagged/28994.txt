There is a debate about the necessity to travel to the country where a language is spoken in order to truly learn the language. When someone travel to the target language country the only way to communicate with people is to speak their language and that result in more practice. In addition he'll learn it from native speakers so there is no fear of learning it incorrectly. Living in an environment that is completely surrounded by the target language is strongly beneficial for the learner. Learner can't speak his native language because people will not understand him therefor he must try to speak their language. People every where speak the target language and that will increase his listening skills. I've studied english language in my country for more than one year but I got more benefits in the united states in just five months. Learning the target language from native speakers guarantees true pronunciation. I've learnt English vocabularies by my self and now I'm facing problems to re correct those vocabularies' pronunciation. Also student study new vocabularies at school and he re listen to them from people so that keeps him remembering their pronunciation as it is happening with me now. It's true that some institutes provide native speakers to teach their languages and students can learn as if they travel abroad to learn. However It's only one benefit in contrast student is forced to learn speak and listen to the target language from native speakers. In conclusion there is no doubt that learning speaking listening to a language in where it's natively spoken is more beneficial than learning it in non native country.
