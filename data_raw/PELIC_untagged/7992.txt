An Unforgettable Place What's your unforgettable place This kind of place is generally supposed to be related to some very impressive experience in our deep memory. Sometimes we benefit directly from it so we feel very grateful for it. Sometimes we learn lessons from it so we can apply it to our future life to avoid the similar undesired situation. For me such a most memorable place is that I had never thought that I was finally in relationship with. Furthermore I found my love and got my desired knowledge there. That place is Tsinghua University which is the most prestigious university in China. It is right this university that saw all unforgettable events that had happened to me in my life.
