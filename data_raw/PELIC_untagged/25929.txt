I am looking for a girl who loves to watch movies. I like to watch action movies that made me exciting. My soul mate is someone that I can talk about the context of movies with her. I can watch movies with her. I like to go the Southside Works which is a big movie theater. In addition I also enjoy walking down the street and watching people to do something. If she likes to do both that we could talk about the style of clothing and feeling. The girl who is optimistic person enjoys her life. I hope that we will enjoy our life and have fun.
