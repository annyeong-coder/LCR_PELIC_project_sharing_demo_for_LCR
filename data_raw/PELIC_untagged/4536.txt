EunJung would be a good roommate for me because she has the similar schedule with me. For example we are both Korean she doesn't have a pet and so do I. She plays a video game as hobby when she is in home also she would like to enjoy a trip and she like to make a cook. Especially her routine are very similar with me. She usually get up at 7 15AM I also get up at 7 00AM. And she is ELI student and so I am. And going to bed getting back home having dinner are very same with me. Of course some parts of all are different such as age sex etc. In spite of that we would be the best roommate each other.
