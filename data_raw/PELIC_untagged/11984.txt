I think that Korean government should encourage uniformity of language in Korea. There are several reasons why we have to keep Korean language Valuing history and excellence of Korean and protecting our own culture. Koreans have their own language Han gul. In the world it is very difficult to find the language which survived for more than 10 decades but Han gul was made more than 1 000 years ago. Also Han gul is praised by many famous linguists for its excellence. Han gul is precise and fine language and it is so easy to learn Han gul that the illiteracy rate in Korea is extremely low. Furthermore using our own language can be a good way to protect our culture. Usually young people try to pursue new things that come from out of their country. After they spend their 20s going after things from other countries they start to look at their things that they had since they were born and compare things they have to things from outside. Finally they will realize that the excellence and the preciousness of their own language and culture. What could happen if Korean government decided to accept other language as an official language First of all there would be a chaotic period because Koreans consisted of single ethnicity and language for a long time. Also Koreans have lots of cultures and long history from ancestors who used Han gul so new people who use other language would not accept these cultures and history as theirs. As a result the unique characteristics of Koreans could be faded or disappeared. For these merits of keeping Korean only and demerits of allowing using other language I strongly recommend to hold the uniformity of language in Korea.
