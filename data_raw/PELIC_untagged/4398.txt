I was writing a e mail when my roommate came back. While he was cooking I took shower. We were watching a TV news while we were eating a dinner. After I came back my lesson I slept for 2 hours. When I was reading a squirrel was looking me that live on the tree close to my room window. While I writing this sentences my roommate went to the shop. I was dreaming to become a pilot when I was a child. Once the river beach a man came to the old man and said Your wife falled down to a water she was flowed and disapeared . The old man went to the river and was seeking his wife through upside of the river. Man asked Why are you seeking your wife through upside of river. She might have flowed downside of the river . Old man answered She was a stubborn one and might have gone upside the river .
