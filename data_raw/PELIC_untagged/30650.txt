today initial recourse for many of us is Internet which provide our computers. The research is good example too if recently we had to find some information in piles of books or magazines today we simply look it up on Google or similar programs. It is convenient and available resource for many type of information. It is evident once we knew it we doesn t want to refuse it anymore. Another great feature of using computer for me is entertainment. I just love to watch movie TV show and funny video which you can easily find through your computer with Internet. If you don t have time to see your favorite TV show in time it is not a problem at all now. You can just click Youtube or other websites and here we go you can enjoy your watching. Nowadays technologies develop so fast and sometimes we can t catch them up but many of us can use our computer with Internet access as a great recourse. We use it for communication information and entertainment. My University IT teacher told me in 1994 that a computer without Internet access is used only approximately on 30 . In that time I didn t imagine how right he was. Unfortunately he passed away in couple years after our conversation and couldn t see by himself how this concept was obvious today. Today computer with Internet access is very important devise so we can t even imagine our life without it.
