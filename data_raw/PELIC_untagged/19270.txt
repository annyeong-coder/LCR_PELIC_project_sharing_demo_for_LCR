I ran out of money many times since I stoped working and back to school. I was earning a great deal of money when I was working now I am using the money I earned. Being out of money makes me think about other people who do not have money I started spending moneny more wisely than before. I stoped buying many stuff I realized I am not in need for them by this way I am saving a little amount of money.
