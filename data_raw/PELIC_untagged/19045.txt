Breathing training is very difficult in singing area. My German teacher had told me a lot of practice methods. One time she helped me to find a long rubber band she let me hold the band with the both sides and pull . That is very hard to hold the rubber band but she made me hold it steadily. During the practice I should feel the muscle of my upper part of the body. She got me to grasp this practice fast and she made me practice every day. I appreciate her giving me so many practice methods she helped me to find the way how can I study singing by myself in the future.
