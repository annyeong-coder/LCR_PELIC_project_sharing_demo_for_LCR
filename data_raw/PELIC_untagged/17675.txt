To make the desicion to travel by yourself it's not easy you have to be motivated and realize that it will take a lot of effort for you to be away from you family for over a year. From my perspective the best way to handle it is to focus on everything that you know will be hard. And letting all the positve sides be a bonus that will make it easier for you. It's different to be pessimistic than careful of your expectations. When you travel and work by yourself in another country all the desicion is up to you. You don't have anyone you can lean or blame on. You will be more independent and you will grow as a person. For example when you wake up every morning and see that you are not laying in your own bed in your own house where you have a family you love. And the closest way you can get in contact with them is a phone call. You get stronger as a person.
