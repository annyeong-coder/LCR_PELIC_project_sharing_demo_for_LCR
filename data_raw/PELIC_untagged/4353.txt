Yesterday I had many extra classes apart from ELI classes. I had TOEFL class and conversation partner class. After that when I went to my apartment I moved my stuffs to a new apartment. It took about 3 hours to finish to move my stuffs to my new apartment. Then I went to have dinner with my sister and my friend at Oriental Kitchen restaurant.
