When I was in Chicago last one day I went to a restaurant that was famous at that time. I ordered a bowl of rice and a slice of pizza. My cousin were I met him in the restaurant had a chicken . The food was horrible the rice was too salty and the pizza was too cold and my cousin chicken was not cooked enough.
