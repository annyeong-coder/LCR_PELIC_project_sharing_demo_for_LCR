When I lived in Tokyo for 4 years since 2000 I went around the historical place in my free time. Because there has been a lot of famous historical place in Tokyo and I have been able to move easily by convenient transportations. For last 1 year and a half in Hiroshima before moving to the United State I preferred to take the rest listening to classical music in my free time. Because I was very busy to take care of my grand children especially my second grandson was a baby.
