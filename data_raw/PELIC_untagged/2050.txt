My name is Dan ANON_NAME_0. I'm from Taipei City but I'm living in Pittsburgh now. My father gives me the name and it means he hopes that I'm always living safe and well in my life. My interests is listening to the music and dancing. I like popular music irrespective of Chinese or Other languages. My favorite dancing is Latin dance because it keeps my shape. I have some good hobbies and bad hobbies. I'm always cleaning my room. I'm always studying after class. However I'm always making my mom angry because I'm always playing on weekend. I'm always going out with my friends. My parents don't like that because they think that a girl should be quiet and stay at home on weekend. I'm planning on going back my country on April. When I arrive in my country I'm going to take the Toeic test and find a job.
