I would nominate who is the best for my children and who have experianc for example did he rise child befor what is his her relagien did he have stable and secuere home for my children and what s he can provide for them fainally the most emportant thing is the educational level. Then there is sensitive resones like s he age and health because I need somebody take care of my child not to take care of him her selfe . The guardian relationship sometime affect his her life with positive or nigative ways so if its stable that mean s he good for the children.
