I live with my Turkish friend whose bed is located next to my bed. There are two desks that are also next to each other. My computer is on my desk and desk lamb is in the corner of the desk. We have just one bookcase that is right left of my desk. There is a plug between our desks. The perpendicular rug is on the ground and staying parallel to the window. Our room is rather plain and this situation helps us to prevent it from mess.
