Dear Mr. ANON_NAME_0. I am a student at the EFL computer training institute. My classes are very good but the Institute had better make some improvements or mant students are going to leave. First I think tou should clean the office. Second you should change the window. Third you should arrange the desk. Forth you should sweep the floor. Last you should change the wall paper.
