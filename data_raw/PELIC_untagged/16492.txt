Long time ago when I was a child I did allot of things. Lake example I plead out said with my friends. Another think that I liked to do was to bring a dog or a cat that I fond on the street. My parent usual herd the same music every Saturday. Today I'm older and I don't bring an animal that I'm find in the street. I have one dog and it's enough!
