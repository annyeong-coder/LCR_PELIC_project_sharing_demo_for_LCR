Staying on the desert island might be a little dangerous so we need some items that should be useful and reliable. We have to bring a knife. With the knife we can cut something and maybe we might need to defend against some animals or insects. Matches have to be one of items of our equipment. We can make a fire with it to cook something. We must bring a flashlight to light at night while moving. Because we might get hurt if we cannot see where we have to put our steps. What about a fishing pole I think we should bring it to fish and have some fun.
