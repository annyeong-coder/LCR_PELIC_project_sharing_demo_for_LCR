If someone is in flow he or she reaches ultimate state of creativity in which children immerse themselves in doing creative job and can feel genuine pleasure. I felt the pleasure of creativity when expressing my opinion in writing in English. There was no 'answer' so I wrote my thoughts freely. In my opinion an individual learner should find something he or she is interested in and trust his or her own potential for creativity. Moreover schools have to make circumstances for students to choose what they want to do.
