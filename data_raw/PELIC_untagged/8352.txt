I got my toefl score last semester. I had been planning for 6 months. Before I got the qualify score I'd been worrying about the speaking part test. Before I started practicing English I had given up several times. But as soon as I began studying hard. I'd been practicing the speaking part for 4 months. So far I have found the best way to speak since I started practicing. I have been solving the hard part. As the result when I started to speak I knew I could pass.
