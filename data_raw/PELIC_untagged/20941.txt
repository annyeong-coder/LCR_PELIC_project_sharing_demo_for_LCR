I would like to write about should we begin to teach English as a second language to our children when they are very young they are about 5 Learning and teaching English is an issue in South Korea. If it is necessary what time is the best to do that Some say that learning English is more efficient as they are younger and younger. And some parents tried to begin teach them as they are 4 or 5 years. Some scholars recommend those ways. However I do not agree with these tendencies. I think that it is not too late to learn English after they learned their mother language. Some scholars revealed what problems are when they learn it as they are so young. Therefore I would like to write about that. I'm not sure it is good topic or not or there are many sources underlies my opinions.
