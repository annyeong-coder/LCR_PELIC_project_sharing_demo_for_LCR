Two Heads are Better than One I believe the English saying that says two heads are better than one. First last semester when I was playing soccer I fell down and the my thumb was broke from a dislocated. Then by the time I couldn't help myself but my friends came to me immediately to take me to a hospital. Next in the hospital my doctor decided to take me to surgery to return my finger to its place. At the time my friends were nervous and concern about me especially when the doctors were taking me to operating room. They were waiting for what will happen. When the surgery finished successfully my friends took me to a hotel to take a rest. Although the surgery was painful I was really glad at the time when my friends stayed with me in the hotel. Finally in this life you can't stay alone without your friends. One day will come when you will need them.
