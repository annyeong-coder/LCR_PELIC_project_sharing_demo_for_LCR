The U. S. Government decided that cigarettes are the major cause of death and disease and discourage its citizens from smoking. But the U. S. Encourages people of other nations to smoke by being a powerful ally of the tobacco industry. As a result the U. S. Cigarettes business is booming exports are soaring and factories being built. What other countries want from the U. S. Is a relationship but not American tobacco.
