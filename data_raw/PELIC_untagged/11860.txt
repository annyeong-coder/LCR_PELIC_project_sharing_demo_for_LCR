There is only one place where I am pleasant to spend all of my lunch time on and enjoy with the yummy food Thai Gourmet restaurant. It is located on Bloomfield area close to Strip Market. There are almost ten Thai restaurants around Pittsburgh but do you know why I ranked Thai Gourmet to be the number one of mind. These are a few reasons that why I would like to have lunch there. First of all after I tried all of Thai restaurant's food around Pittsburgh I have to say Thai Gourmet's food is extremely original test such as Moo ANON_NAME_0 Yum Neam Sod and Papaya Salad. The second reason is freshness of the gradients that they use to cook. It is undoubting why the gradients were fresh because the distant between the restaurant and Strip Market is very close each other therefore the gradients are used day by day for example if you order Spicy Rice Noodle with Shrimp you will know how sweet from the fresh shrimp is. Lastly if I compare the price of Thai food in Pittsburgh Thai Gourmet is the cheapest than another. I always need to ask them wrap the rest of food back every times after I could not be done with it. Not only the original Thai's test freshness of the gradients and reasonable price but also fast and warmth service from beautiful waitress that I can not let another restaurant to be number one of my mine.
