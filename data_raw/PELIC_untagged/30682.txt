This article is about how the United States is a country of immigrants. At the very beginning the Spanish French and English moved America to start their new life soon after it was discovered. These immigrants pushed Native American onto new land further land. Even immigrants was an important part of America they looked down on new immigrants because they looked the new immigrants as a problem. Most immigrants came to the US for economic reasons because Americans needed the immigrants to work and farm land. The economic opportunities also inspired immigrants to move to America to create a better life. Meanwhile Americans expected that immigrants could adopt American culture quickly. However most of immigrants tried to keep their own culture language and religious practices. For example the Huguenots adopted American culture very quickly but the German and Irish immigrants still maintained some aspects of their cultures. Today America considered a mosaic with immigrants adding their culture heritage to the mix of American culture. Because in a mosaic each piece keeps its own special identity while contributing to a large design so that people thought the mosaic idea represent the diverse multicultural society of United States.
