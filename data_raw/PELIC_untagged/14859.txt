Travel economical educational and fun Nowadays many people think about how to make trip with a lowest cost get some educational and have a lot of fun. I think it is possible to make the trip like this. First of all economical we can go to other countries and have a vacation over there with a low cost by stay in the motel or guesthouse instead of hotel. It will help us to save a lot of money. More over we can eat a frozen food instead of traditional food or luxury restaurant. Secondly educational we can get a lot of education by go to the history place in each country. It will help us to know the history of that country. In addition we can also learn how their life by looking at their daily life.
