Before I came Pittsburgh I aready picked out to live with host family. To live here doesn't let me down. It cheers me up when I look over this area. Because this is so fresh area I came to figure out the importance of fresh air. In addition I feel comfortable because this neighborhood is similar to the place where I grew up. However distances from home to school bring me down. Sometimes I feel like giving up to go to school in rush hours. That's why I have to get on the bus early. Even if there are some bad points to live this house I'd like to keep on living here.
