There are many ideas to be awake in the classes. However I think the best idea to be awake in the classes is to sleep early at night. And that subquent many things. First of all don't take a nab afternone. Because that propeply don't make feel sleepy at night. Also you shouldn't sleep after you eat your dinner. I mean you should take rest after you eat and after that get to your bed. Because you might feel bad or you may see a bad dream. Finally if you sleep early and wake early you will feel good and you will be happy all your day.
