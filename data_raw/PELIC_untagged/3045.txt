Dear Mr. ANON_NAME_0 I am a student at the EFL Computer Training Institute. My classes are good but the Institute had better make some improvements or many students are going to leave. First I think you had better decorate the Training Institute. It is too tattered. Then I give you some decisions you had better put away the electric wire of light because it is very dangerous. You should not paste the papers on the broken glass window. You should turn on all of the light when we are working. You should ask the staff to clean the Institute every day and they ought to empty the trash every day. They had better not drink or eating when we are working. Everything should be neat in the room. And they ought to close the door when they are working. In addition you had better buy more computer and chairs for the Training Institute. That's all I can tell you. It should improve now. Your student Jian
