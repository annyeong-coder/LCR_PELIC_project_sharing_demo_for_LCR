Me and my friends love to go shopping together. One day we wanted to buy a dress for a party. We stopped at the first shop and found a pretty dress and we really like it so we decided to buy but after we bought we saw another shop which has the same dress as we bought and the price is much cheaper. We were so regret and think that we shouldn't have bought this dress and we must have checked with the other shop before made any decision.
