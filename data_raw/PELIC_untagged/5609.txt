There are three things that I never do it before I came to Pittsburgh. First I had never cooked any kind of food before because my mother or my sister always cook foods but now I have to cook by myself. Next I had never cleaned a bathroom before. When I stayed in my country my servants did it but now I have to do it by myself. Last I had never done a laundry by myself before but I have to do it by myself now.
