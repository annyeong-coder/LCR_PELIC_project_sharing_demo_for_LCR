I used to live in Mongolia and used to dry weather. Also I didn't use to do home activities. In my country I used to play my daughter and used to visit to my friends. At the weekend I used to play a billiard with my workmates. Now I am used to living in Pittsburgh and am used to adapting to humid weather. I am used to living alone doing all my home activities. In here I am not used to visiting to my friends also I am almost not used to my native language. At the weekend I am used to shopping.
