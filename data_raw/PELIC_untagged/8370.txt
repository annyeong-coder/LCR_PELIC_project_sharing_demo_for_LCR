Two head are better than one. I agree that two head are better than one. I have some experience about it. I have friends in the ELI. We are from diffierent countries. We met at my home last Wednesday. I wanted to serve some food for dinner. It was not easy because I had to make 5 servings. It was a lot of food. My friends came to my home early however and they helped with my work. HJ washed vegetables and ANON_NAME_0 sliced it. Patty and I cooked. Aybala brought a handmade cake for dessert so I didn't need to make a dessert. We made dinner together and we were able to make dinner more easily. If I made dinner alone it would be more difficult. If I made food alone I had to wash the vegetables to cook a lot of food and to wash the dishes at the same time becouse cooking makes some dishes. Also I had to cook some dessert. It takes long time and it's not easy. If I had it I needed more time and effort But I didn't need it becouse helpping of my friends. We were able to work easier whthin more short time. That day we enjoyed meeting and it will remain good memory for me. If we help each other it makes work easier.
