Nowadays most people look up in newspaper specifically in travel section to find out some information that help them to make interesting trip. So some of them look for economical educational or fun purposes. There are many economical purposes like shopping around for a cheep ticket selecting the lowest price of transportation or find out some important ways which help to improve own business. Otherwise most people read the travel section for educational reasons such as going to museum visiting famous universities which help to select the best major in the future or sometimes for research purposes. Today most goals of travel are to have fun. Thus most people are looking up in the travel section to acquire more information about the beautiful places around the world. Moreover they are interesting to try new food or to attend football matches. In summery there are many reasons let people look up through the travel section in newspaper such as economical educational or fun reasons. In my opinion I prefer reading this section for education purpose because that will give the more experience about other cultures.
