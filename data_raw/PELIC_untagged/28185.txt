This is largely because clean air and water are indispensable to the survival of both humans and animals. Under the pretext of the industrialism and agriculturism our society has being destroyed the nature . Although governments has contributed to develop a civilized society this too much fast development is bringing a countless of other problems. Companies are not only mindlessly releasing toxic substances into river but also emitting exhaust gas into air. In addition as society is becoming urbanized people cut a road through hills and cut a countless trees. Given that natural resources is essential for human to survive in the earth and damaged environment also result in catastrophic disasters like floods or landslides a lot of countries should solved the problems of environment before it is too late to solve it. Through history in England because of expensive price of plants people used coal for energy source instead. As a result England has been infamous for air pollution albeit it the Industrial Revolution happened nearly two hundred years ago. From my viewpoint thus it is reasonable time that environment issue must be concern from the government' policy.
