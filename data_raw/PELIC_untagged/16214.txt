I will tell you about myth of Korean Origination Dan gun myth. Long time ago Korean peninsula was controled by God Hwan woong. It was very peaceful world. There were two animals bear and tiger which wanted to be a human. So they visited Hwan woong to tell their wish. The wish was accepted but they were given some conditions by Hwan woong. It was said that they have to stay in the cave for 100 days and eat only garlics and mugworts. The cave was located in the forest. After few days the tiger could not endure the condition and escaped from the cave. However the bear held up through all sorts of hardshops. After 100 days the bear became a woman called Woong nyu. Hwan woong married with her and the first Korean was born Dan gun. We think that all of Koreans are originated from Dan gun and we are inherited pertinacity and faith from him.
