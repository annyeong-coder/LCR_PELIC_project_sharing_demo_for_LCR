Nowadays environmental problems are one of the biggest problems in the world. Most people realized about this issue because it directly affects to our lives. A pollution problem is one kind of problems that people are concerned about. It is happened in all part of the world. In my country Thailand is also facing the pollution problems because we have many kind of petrol transportations such as trucks cars buses and motorcycles. Moreover the government does not have a policy to control the number of vehicles so it is rapidly increasing every years. For this reason Thailand has a chronic environmental problem for many years that Thai try to solve. For example Bangkok the capital city of Thailand is one of the countries that facing a severe traffic congestion problem. As a result of traffic problem Bangkok have to encounter not only air pollution problem but also noise and water pollutions. Besides the pollution problems cause Bangkok to face an increasing temperature in every years. As the problems mentioned above we should solve these problems urgently in order to protect our country and our world.
