One of the most difficult and important decisions that I had ever made was coming to the United States. I remember that time like it is now. . . But I can say that I am proud about myself ans I am happy that I made decision finally. If I hadnt come here I would't have met such perfect people and friends from different countries. If I had stayed in my country I would't have spoken english like I speak in these days. I wouldn't be so strong and brave like I am now. If I hadn't come to Pittsburgh I would have never met my uncle again. I have just one wish. I wish me that I had taken my sister with me because I miss her very much. If she had come here with me I wouldn't have been so alone like I feel now. I would like her to visit me soon.
