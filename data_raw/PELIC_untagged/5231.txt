If you want to do some researches and have no idea about finding references using a computerized card catalog is the best method to begin with. First of all all you need to do is typing your topic in the computer and press the return key. After that the computer will search its database of magazines and journals and it also give you a list of all the articles related to your topic. Secondly you can choose which ones you want to look up and you can print out the list of citations. In addition the dates of the articles are given in the list so you can just look up the most recent ones. Moreover this program can give you another good feature as well. Clicking on the box that says abstract can give you a brief summary of the main points of the articles. Finally if you want to find book references there are magazines and journals in the periodical section on the second floor. Be careful you cannot take them out but there are several copy machines in that area if you need to make a copy of any of the articles. Enjoy your researches!
