Do you know that the people are becoming more addicted to Tobacco From my bad experiment about smoking and going to the hospital once in awhile to see a doctor from the disease that I was smoking it I started to call cigarettes the slow suicide. The rate of Tobacco smoking is much higher than among those with mental illness than among the general population . However while my health was getting worse and worse I discovered two solutions to solve this problem which are by exercising every day and by making yourself busy. First of all when I decided to quit smoking it was really difficult for me because I just stopped smoking without adding an alternate in my life which I believed at that time the only replacement for smoking is by exercising so I started to exercise. By exercising every day for one hour it will keep you away from smoking. Also if you keep exercising regularly you will feel healthier and usually people after they exercise they don't want to smoke which is a good result. Secondly by the time I discovered that not only exercising can solve the smoking problem because it needs to include some things that can keep me totally away of smoking. Personally I kept my self busy all the time by reading books not staying at the same for long periods of time. Also the important thing is to keep your mouth busy by chewing gum so you will not start looking for a cigarette. Finally your health is your life do not throw it away by smoking a cigarette because my health were getting worse and worse until I quit so if you are a smoker follow my solutions or someday you will create your owns.
