Americans like to make heroes to run the country. When someone dies in war Americans make him her heroes so that other people are willing to participate in war and sacrifice themselves. Sometimes I wonder for what they have to die. In World War II there was an acceptable reason to protect their country from invaders. Nowadays wars are for military supplies company's greed. But ordinary Americans make themselves heroes and rush into unjustifiable war. I don't want unnecessary sacrifices. I remember the parodied logo on the bumper of a car We support our troops not who sent them .
