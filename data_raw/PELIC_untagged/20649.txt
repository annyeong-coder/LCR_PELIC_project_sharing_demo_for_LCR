Initially Yolanda's mother want her daughter to be a famous poet so she used to go all the poetry recital her daughter gave and always sit in the first row. She had talent for poet from her young age also. Unfortunately she transformed from a girl who has no hair to the most popular instructor of the college but not on purpose. However she still loves poet although she declared that she was not poet anymore. She write down her profession as writer teacher and this fact indicates that she doesn't abandon her talent. The most important fact is that her mother consider her daughter a poet and Yolanda isn't reluctant to accept this fact also. It is inevitable for Yolanda to pursue her dream maybe her recital will keep lasting as far as she lives.
