I want to introduce how to make greentea esense pack for keeping fair skin. It is easy to make pack if you follow several steps. First of all prepare one piece of soft thin towel some of greentea and honey. Second mix greantea and honeyat the rate of 1 2. You should make thick for appling to your face. After that make wet tower enough and then heat it in the microwave for short time. Be sure not to overheat. Because If you overheat it it's too hot to cover your face. Next wash your face with warm water. Warm water make your skin puts off bad things. After washing apply skin lotion to your face enough for straightening it up. After that attach your sheet on your face and place greentea pack on seet for 20 minutes. Finally take off sheet and don't wash your face. Just apply essense to your face and take a rest. It's my secret keeping fair skin. If you try this way you have fair skin like White Pincess.
