In this chapter the editor is talking about what a big agitation for smoking is going on by tobacco companies through their ads on tvs and logos around the world. The famous american tobacco companies like Kent Marlboro Camel or Philip Morris made their logo very attracting especially for kids Kent has stars and balls almost all kids will be interesting in knowing what it is of course camel is an interesting animal. So by making ads and logos like this tobacco companies are increasing their clients especially among young people. But the tobacco spokesman says tobacco ads in fact attracts only people who already smoke. But most people including me will disagree with this. The only reason for different companies not only tobacco to make ads and commercials is to increase the number of clients. The companies certainly would not spend their money just to tell already smokers to buy their product.
