This picture shows a countryside of Korea where traditional houses are still used. There are three seniors in this picture. One of the old men whose hat and jacket are white is riding a bicycle from left to right on the road. Behind him there is a low wall made by rocks over which people can see the inside. The wall is covered with plastic for the construction period when this wall can be damaged by various tools. There are two old men who are building a traditional house especially the roof of the house beyond the wall. An old man whom another man is looking at is below the roof and is assembling woods. There are three more Korea traditional houses which lots of trees surround in back of this picture.
