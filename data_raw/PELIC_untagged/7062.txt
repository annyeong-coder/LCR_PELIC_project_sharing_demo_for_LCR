WHO IS A FRIEND I think a best friend is someone who always tells me the truth because he doesn't need to cheat me. He always wants my happiness and my felicity. He always has better perspective than me about my problems and know how he can help me to find a solution. He understands me respects me and accepts me the way I am. This friend who helps me when I am in trouble is someone who doesn't have a price because there isn't enough money to pay him for everything that he does for me like listen me give an advice support me and be my friend. A friend is someone who keeps my secret who is my partner who does things with me and who shares his feelings with me. Probably a best friend and a friend share similar characteristics but a best friend is someone who is always on my side is my right arm and has heart while a friend is someone who is not always there.
