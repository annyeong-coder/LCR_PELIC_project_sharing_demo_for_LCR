Sports stars earn ridiculously large saleries. It's easy to know about this fact through messmedia. When someone who is a famous sport start wins the game or move to another team the salery is always mentioned and it's a tremendous number. Even ordinary people whose saleries are the highest they can't make money as much as sports stars earn easily. It's the same to do their best and try to acheive their goal but sports stars have make more money than ordinary people. Even if sports stars have much more hardness in physical it can't be justified that they should earn much money. Ordinary people also have hardness in different ways. If what they are going to do is required to have specific skills or knowledge they study or get some experiences that make them helpful. Like sports stars train everyday ordinary people upgrade their skills or knowledge through diverse activites. So it doesn't seem to be fair that only they can earn moeny like that. There should be some standard to restrict to earn unlimited money to sports starts.
