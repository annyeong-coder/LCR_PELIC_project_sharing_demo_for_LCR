Many years ago my father persuaded me to choose education as my major when I was preparing exam for entering a university. I didn't hear my inner voice to follow my father's suggestion. Looking back on the situation now I wish I had not been dogmatic to choose economy as my major. At that time my dad really hoped that I could work in a high school as a teacher. Sometimes when I was sleeping on the bed I was thinking that I would be a crazy or a nice teacher now if I had chosen education as my profession. Unfortunately I have to work in an office room when teachers and students were having a summer vocation. I am jealous of teachers in my country because I would still get salary during the summer vocation if I were a teacher who does not need to work at summer. It would be wonderful if I were a professor who does not need to prepare his or her class presentation in the office room where I hate working. If only I had listened to my father!
