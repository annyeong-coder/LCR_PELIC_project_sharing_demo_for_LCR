I agree with ANON_NAME_0 about people can use stereotypes to help with conflict resolution. For example stereotype allow us to put people into a category and make inferences about how they will behave based on that grouping. There will still be differences between individuals from one culture and with the same individual in different situations. But the stereotype is reasonably accurate so it is useful.
