I have had many experiences using English for example by the time I had to go to the United States embassy back in my country I had to use a formal and confident English in order to talk to the agent to get my visa approved. In deed I had to talk with my advisor for choosing the right school for my master and it was a very polite English not the same one when I'm with my friends we used to have some slangs and it makes the language very simple or the way I communicate with my girlfriend we speak Spanish but both of us incorporate some words in English of course it makes the language broken but to us its fine because we get to practice both languages and we absolutely understand each other.
