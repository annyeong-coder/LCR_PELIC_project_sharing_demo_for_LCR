I agree with the idea don't disclose too much personal information. Although we should be honest in online dating it is not necessary for users to release all informaiton becasue it is possible that someone abuse our information. For instance if I write my cell phone number someone who see my profile might call me for telematketing or might use my phone number as crime. Thus we do not need to tell too much information. On the other hand I disagree with the idea don't do all the talking. In my opinion it is esential that each users who would like to develop relationship have much time to talk. We need to express our intention by our voice. In addition I feel that words that are typed frequently give me a sensation of coldness. Therefore I insist that we should spend much time to talk without online.
