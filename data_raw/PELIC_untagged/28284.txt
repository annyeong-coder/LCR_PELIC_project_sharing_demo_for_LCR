My family has lived in Yanbu city for 12 years. We used to live in small house. In 2001 we moved to Jeddah city and we are living in a big house. We have traveled twice every year but from 2006 my family has traveled three times. In 1998 my big brother moved to other city to studying. Also in 1999 he went to US first time to get his Bachelor degree in computer science. He has been in US for 11 years.
