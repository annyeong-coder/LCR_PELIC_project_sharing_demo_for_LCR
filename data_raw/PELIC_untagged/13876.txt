These days English is floated as a worldwide language which resulted in that many Korean have learned English in various countries where there citizen use English such as America Canada Australia Philippine and so on. It seems that English is getting more important in Korea which caused many people to think that English has to be an official language in Korea. This policy has been very controversial among Koreans especially students and teachers. There are many people who think that English as an official language will make lots of benefits to Korea because many problems will be solved if English becomes an official language in Korea such as the growth of economy of Korea high expenditure of learning English free communication with people around the world and so on. However I disagree to this opinion and insist that English shouldn't be an official language in Korea due to 3 reasons. First using English in Korea is not relevant to growth of economy of Korea. Second enforcement of using English will cause more costs than present when English is not an official language. Third not all Koreans need English to communicate and if English becomes an official language it will make the gap of communication abilities deepen. My purpose to write this essay is for trying to change thoughts of people who insist English should be an official language and to warn them their thought can be dangerous in the future of Korea and threat our identity as a Korean.
