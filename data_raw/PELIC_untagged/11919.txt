Hong ANON_NAME_0 Express which is a Chineses food restaurant and located in downtown is my favorite place to eat lunch in Pittsburgh. I have my lunch there with my classmates twice in a week. For one reason is that you can drink for free if showing your student identification. You can enjoy the lunch and the drink that's matched in your stomach. The other reason I like to go there is the owner's passion to the customers. When we order the meal the owner always recommand us the popular food with smile and it tastes really good. The price is also cheaper than the others. For example Tso Gen Special Lunch is my favorite one and just 5. 25 Dollars including the taxes. For the most important reason is that every time I have my lunch there it makes me miss the food in my country. I really miss my mother's homemade food. Next time if you visit Pittsburgh it's a pretty good place to have a lunch.
