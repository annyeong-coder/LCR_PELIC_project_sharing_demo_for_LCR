I have been most influnece by one person who was my close friend. Even though everything was totally different between he and I such as personailty enviroment and living style I was taught a lot of things which I had never known before by him. When we shared our ideas and thoughts we had some samll argument if some of them were not matched. Most arguments couldn't be answered what is right or wrong so it was so difficult to end our conversation. However through this I could be more open mined to accept other opinions and the knowlege or facts which he gave me while talking was extended. Unfortunately he and I don't contact anymore but he will always be remembered by me for being special in my life.
