I met Yuri who is my best friend while I was studying in elementary school. Yuri was not my classmate at the first time. While I was talking with one of my friends she came to us. We said hello and that was all. However in the next year we met each other again as classmates. She was standing next to the door when I opened it. We were surprised because we didn't expect to meet again. Since then we became close and now she is my best friend.
