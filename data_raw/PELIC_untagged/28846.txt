Topic 1 Viewpoint A. These days many universities around the USA starting to receive the student application for spring terms some students probably submitted his application others still struggle to do his best to get good score for standardized tests such as TOEFL and GRE . Because many universities pay too much attention on standardized test students get upset when they receive low scores and prefer not to apply soon. Paying too much attention is a bias against the student and also unfair to judge student ability on one exam. What universities doing is a bias against the students they put the student in jeopardy because he has a bad score on one standardized exam. Looking the whole application to choose a good student should be the only way to accept him. Many students have good work experience excellent recommendation letter and good grades on his whole previous schools. So why universities through away all these good things because of one exam In addition some students got bad scores for these exams not because they are not qualified students but may be because the exam stress and the stress that student put over their shoulder to get a good score to get accepted lead them not to concentrate and do well. Some students get sick at the day of the exam. This is really unfair they work so hard trying to do their best and to get study in good universities but because of one exam his dream will go away. Universities have the right to choose a good students to study and work with her by asking all the student to do the same exam the standardized test .
