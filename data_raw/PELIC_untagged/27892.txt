This essay is very well written. From the first word until the last one the reader is completly plunged into the stroy of Al the main character. The story has a double face and on the one hand it can be considered as the lovely second life of an ex alcoholic but on the other hand there are a lot of sad aspects which make us feel depressing such as the fact that Jack will die or the difficult life that Al has had. I can't relate to it because I have never had a dog and I have a very different relationship with my grandparents but this does not prevent me from finding the story touching. It would be interesting to discuss about how to talk about death to children. Should we tell them the truth or protect their innoncence about this topic.
