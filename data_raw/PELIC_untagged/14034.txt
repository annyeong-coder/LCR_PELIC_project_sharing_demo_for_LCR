The authors mention that 'flow' is entering the ultimate state of creativity. I think the authors want to emphasize the importance of nature being concentrated so they use 'flow' instead of the march of time. For instance water flows from rivers to oceans endlessly. It does not care about time weather and everything. Also nobody can stop the flow of water. Hence if children fall into 'flow' they can only concentrate on their interests such as the flow of water. Therefore nothing can interrupt children when they fall into 'flow'. They can think and focus on their interests regardless of time. For those reasons creativity of children can be improved by 'flow'.
