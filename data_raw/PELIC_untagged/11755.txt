The most important decision I made in my life is to choose to move to the south part of China to live. If I hadn't moved to south I would have a totally different life. The city I moved to is near the coast and the city itself is a important seaport. So it is a open and vigorous city where I can develop a open minded perspective of life. If I had lived in my hometown which is a peachful but conservative small town I would not come to the U. S and maybe I would just went to work after I graduated from high school. What's more If my family had been living in north China we might have been poorer than now and my father and mother would not have their own company. It is the city where they are live now that offered them such opportunity. In addition If I had not moved I would not have met my girlfriend. I don't want that so I am very satiefied with this decision. I hope I could finish my study in the U. S as quickly as possible and then go back to China.
