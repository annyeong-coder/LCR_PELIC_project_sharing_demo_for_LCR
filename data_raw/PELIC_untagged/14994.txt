I met my friend Abduallah when I was living in Alkhobar in Saudi Arabia. Today Abduallah is my best friend. I remember the first time I met him at Starbucks. I was working on a project with a friend of mine when he came toward us to say hi to my friend. At that time I didn't know him at all. When my friend introduced him to me I remembered him. He was my classmate in intermediate school but we weren't close friends. After that I started to meet him from time to time until we became close friends. A while after that I was looking for apartment when he suggested that I move with him because his roommate just moved out. We lived together for a year. Then I graduated from the university and I came to Pittsburgh. Abduallah graduated last summer and now he is planning to come to Pittsburgh to do his masters degree.
