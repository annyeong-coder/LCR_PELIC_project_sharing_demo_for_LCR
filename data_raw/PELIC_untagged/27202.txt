ome papers about Niagra falls trip at Niagra Center Building we came down to the side of Niagra river and we took a boat that it moved to the outskirts of falls and went back to the port. In that time I felt a strange sensation about this amazing falls and I thought over how does my god create this falls so I said Subhan Allah for every new view. After we got down from the boat we went to a big garden and we lay over the grass to relax and sleep so we stayed there for about 1 hour. After that we took unforgettable pictures with some nice people. Then we ate our lunch in subway restaurant. Finally we travelled from Niagra at 3 pm and we went back to Pittsburgh at 6 30 pm. I think this day is one of special days in my life.
