There is something really bad going on in the world today US cigarette companies are doing everything they can to sell cigarettes to many countries outside the US and children are really suffering because of this. The number of smokers in the US has decreased for 8 straight years but sales outside the US have more than tripled since 1985. Even worse a very scary problem for the world is the strategies US cigarette companies are using to sell cigarettes to young people. In Latin America as many as 50 of teenagers smoke. In Hong ANON_NAME_0 even 7 year old kids smoke. Not only US cigarette companies but the US government also has to do something to solve this unethical problem in the world today. I am not a smoker and I actually do not like it at all when people smoke in front of me. If people want to smoke that is their right and I do not have anything to say about it. However according to the article what the US cigarette companies are doing is very unethical. Many children are becoming smokers because of advertisement and because of free cigarettes in social places. Cigarette companies say they are trying to advertise to people who already smoke but that is a really bad lie. Of course they are trying to attract more non smokers like children to become smokers and they can make the most money out of them. This is a really serious problem for the world today and the cigarette companies and the US government have to solve this problem because both of them are responsible.
