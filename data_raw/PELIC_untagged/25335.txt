Ill always know that they always be with me in my harte . The corect one A Sad Memory One day when I was sleeping peacefully Suddenly the door opened. I knew that something was going on . My sister woke me up in different way And she was so gentle with me . When I opened my eyes I knew something happened. After awhile she held my hand and started to cry I couldn't catch my breath. It was my grandmother. She died . After that I couldn't talked for two hours. It was like a dream to me. And then I went to the mosque and I saw everybody crying. She was a great woman's. Everybody loved her . I didn't cry at all . I was in shock and for 3 days I didn't cry at all. I tried to be strong and I didn't show my father what I really felt because I didn't want to make him suffer because of me like when my mother died. At that time I was having test in school and I couldn't focus at all . Finally I was able to cry in the class room. I began to cry and I realized that she was gone forever. I know it seems embarrassing but it made me feel better. I kept all the feelings inside me but when they went out it released me . In my life all of my favorite people died but it didn't break me. It made me stronger . I will always know that they will always be with me in my heart .
