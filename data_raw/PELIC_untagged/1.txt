I met my friend Nife while I was studying in a middle school. I was happy when I met him because he was a good student in our school. We continued the middle and high school to gather in the same school. We were studying in the different classes in the middle school however in the high school we were studying in the same class. We went to many places in the free time while we were studying in the high school. When we finished from the high school I went to K. S University and he went to I. M University. While we were enjoying in academic life we made many achievement in these universities. I graduated when Nife was studying in the last semester in the university. After that I got a job. Fortunately it was nearby my home. I worked two years then I got scholarship from ministry of high education in my country. When I came here to U. S my friend Nife arrange some documents to study at grad school in Malaysia.
