My weekend was so busy first of all I welcomed my friend he came from my country Libya he just arrived on Friday evening. So he was as a guest for me. On Saturday morning I spent most of time to find an apartment for him and his family to live. And I found. And then I took him to his new apartment after that I took him to furniture store to buy some needs. Finally I got a few hours to study and to do my homework. Then I went to deep sleeping.
