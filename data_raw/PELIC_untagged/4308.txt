Doubtless no one has not faced this kind of a problem with his or her bosses plainly I had this experience twice in my business life. My X boss and I might not have come together. The reasons for both situations are the nationality and the jalousie of me. One of my characters is to play the win win situation though but both X bosses were not fine with this character which is playing the win win situation they want to be the winner all the time and for all situations they faced. In fact I should not have been clear a bout this character in front of them. I should work quite in front of them but the co workers in both organizations should not have talked about me all the time with positive thought in front of the other supervisor and bosses though because the other supervisors are strict and they act as manager with there co worker and treat them co worker as an animal and they must have been cool and treat the co worker as a human being not as an animal or machine. My boss should understand that the role should have been act equally to the entire employee including him self. The promotion and incentive should not stop or delay because of the clarity or because of being modest person though they must re read the company polices twice to understand the role play it as it is not to play some of it and ignore the rest of it because of liking it or heating. To be the adulterate for applying the company roles is awful. They should not have applied the adulterate at the role of the origination. I have to not change this characteristic because once I applied it win win game I feel confidant and the co worker which I usually called them my brothers of success are happy and they had do their best in the work because their feel that I trust them and I know that there are a human being rather than an animal or machine once the do there job the thanks and the success is for all of us not only for me as a supervise. My boss are supposed to understand the TEAM work game as well.
