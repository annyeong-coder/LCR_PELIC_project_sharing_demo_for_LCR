I am writing about the pearl of the desert Ghadamis . It located in the southwest of my country. It's a tiny place surrounded by alot of thhe sand. It's an old city and it has magnificent history. It was one of the important places in the world trade between the north and the south of the great desert. It's one of the nice places in my country I advice every tourist to visit it. The population of this city estimated about 10. 000 People. The people of this city are proud of their town and their culture. They cooperated to make their city beautiful and clean to attract and fascinate the tourists from over the world and to ensure the survival to their city. The best time to visit this city is October every year because there is a big carnical in the old town. More over in the evening you could watch the live city in the silent desert. I wish you will visit this place some day.
