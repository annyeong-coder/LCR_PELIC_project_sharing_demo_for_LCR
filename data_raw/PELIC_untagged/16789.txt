While I was studying in senior high school I met my friend Shinjan. He was a very funny person. At first school day when he sat near my seat I was talking with him. And then I occurred that we have the same hobby. We all liked baseball. Sometimes we made ball by paper and played baseball game in my classroom. While he was pitching the ball I always hit the ball to be the Home Run. We always debated about who is the best hitter. When he forgot to do his homework I always let him copy my homework. When we were absent from the class we were arresting together by teacher. He is my familiar senior high school friend. After college exam we entered the same university and majored in the same department. While he was studying in the library we usually shared the course note to each other. While he was making a proposal I help him to finish this. So we are a very good friend alike my brother. We had a very crazy and wonderful memory about our studying period and it's the most relationship for me.
