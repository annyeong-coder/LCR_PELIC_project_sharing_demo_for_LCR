My apartment is now clean and tidy. I have recently made some changes in it. I covered up the floor with new carpet. I tore down a wall to make the kitchen more spacious. I took the curtains down and threw away most of the old furniture. I hung up new curtains on every window and put up pictures on some walls. I painted the walls and touched them up with some decorations. An electrician helped me to fix new bulbs to light up some corners. I feel happy to spend more time in my house now because that cheers me up.
