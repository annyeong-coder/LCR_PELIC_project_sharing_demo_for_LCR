As mentioned above crocodiles and alligators are quite similar. However we can differentiate by using their snout shapes. For example alligators have broader and U shaped snouts whereas crocodiles have narrower and V shaped snouts. Moreover alligators and crocodiles have different types of teeth. Alligators have stick out of jaw teeth. They are visible when their mouths are closed. On the other hand crocodiles' teeth don't stick out of jaw. They are not visible when their mouths closed. Furthermore we can differentiate both of them by using their skin colors. Alligators have darker skin than crocodiles. They are usually in gray or black which are different from crocodiles that have lighter color skin. They are usually in olive or tan colored.
