Today is Sunday. I'm going to cook pancakes for breakfast. These ingredients are eggs flour milk sugar salt and butter. First crack the eggs into a bowl and beat them well. Second add the flour to the bowl. Next add the milk little by little and mix it carefully. Don't over mix. Then add the sugar and the salt. After that heat a frying pan over a moderate fire and put the butter in the pan. When the butter melts put the dough in it. Then cook both sides till it is golden brown. Finally remove it to a dish and enjoy it with maple syrup. It will be delicious. I promise. How about you too
