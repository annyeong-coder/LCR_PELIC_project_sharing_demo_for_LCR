Since I finished my military service 2003 I have wanted to travel many foreign countries. In fact by 2005 I had never traveled to any other countries. When I dropped the university in Korea by 2006 I had made some plan to make a trip. So after my dropping university I have been looking around out of Korea. In addition before I came to Pittsburgh I hadn't wanted to live with my syster in Pittsburgh. Acually I had really hated what my sister had handled me in Korea but because of my financial problem I've been living with my sister. Also I had wanted to make a girl friend who is very beautiful before I came to U. S. But I hadn't yet met her by I came to Pittsburgh.
