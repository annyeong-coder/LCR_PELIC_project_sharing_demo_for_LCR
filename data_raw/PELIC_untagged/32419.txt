Internet as a Way Out Very long ago there were difficulties in making contact each other all over the world. It seemed impossible to see someone in the east while you were in the west. Therefore people needed to travel long distances to trade or study. Of course nowadays when technology has invaded the world everything is possible in an instant. One of technological advance that has changed the world is the Internet. As a matter of fact the internet has affected many areas of life such as education commerce and e government. It is obvious that Internet has made education much easier than in the past. Therefore education is developing more and more thanks to Internet. For example students can apply to any university online even when there are far away from it. Moreover distance learning is now possible for anyone who cannot afford tuition. In other words he can study and get the desirable degree while he is home. In addition it is possible to be a businessman without commuting daily. As a result he or she will save time selling and buying goods at home. There are many examples for online business i. E. Buying products online such as Amazon Booking and Orbitz. Businesspeople demonstrate their products online in order to promote them. Some governments have started e government access since the Internet was introduced. To achieve that system Internet must be used by all departments so that everyone can accomplish what they need to do. Citizens can renew their passports and driver's licenses as well as pay their bills without needing to go to that department. This policy had a fruitful effect which has made life easier. Finally from my perspective Internet has been developing in every field including education business and e government day by day. Therefore life seems to be more convenient. All people can achieve things at one stroke.
