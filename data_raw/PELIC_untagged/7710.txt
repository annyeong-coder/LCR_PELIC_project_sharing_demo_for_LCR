My childhood bedroom is very simple. When you enter my room you can find compurter is on right front corner. Then my desk is next to the compurter. Moreover these is a box for my favorest toys is on right back corner. Also there is a window on back wall which has a very beautiful view can make your mood great. Finally my bed is on left back corner. Even though my bedroom is very simple but I feel very comfortable to live in my simple bedroom.
