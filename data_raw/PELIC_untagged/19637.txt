When I arrived in Pittsburgh I had a lot of things to do. First I found an apartment but I have not equipped it with furniture yet. I bought only necessary things for my apartment but some other things I have not bought yet. Besides the home improvement I wanted to visit museums but I still have not visited them. I also wanted to look for entertainment centers in Pittsburgh but I have not done it yet. Instead of this I bought an electric guitar and the best leisure activity for me is playing my guitar.
