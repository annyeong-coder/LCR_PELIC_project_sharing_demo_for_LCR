New an Apartment One month ago I moved to new an apartment. First I was gloomy by the place and my new neighbor but when I met my neighbor he was a good man and helpful he helped me to carry my staff. He has two kids and a dog his dog is very messy and noisy but the kids are very cute. I'm cheerful actually it's difficult to find good neighbor these days.
