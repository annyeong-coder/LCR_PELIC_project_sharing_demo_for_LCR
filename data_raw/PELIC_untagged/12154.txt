Comparing the differences of Racism between US and Brazil Is very common hearing a Brazilian saying that there is no racism in Brazil. But this isn't a true affirmation. On the other hand the racism in US is reported everyday by the media so the American racism is known by people. Although the racism in those countries is different mostly in the spatial segregation and the job opportunities areas. Spatial segregation is a way of identifying racism. The black community in the US seem to be more segregated that in Brazil. They have special places to shop and most important they live in separated neighborhoods with exclusive black inhabitants. They seem to be a community indeed. However in Brazil we don't see black people as a community their segregation are economic more than all. The neighborhoods that you see more black people are the poorest ones although you can see different kinds races in those areas.
