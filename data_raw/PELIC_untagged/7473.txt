About three years ago I worked in a hospital as an ophthalmologist. I was asked to go to see a patient who stayed in the respiratory department because of pneumonia. He was calm gentle and friendly. Actually his problem with his eyes was just conjunctivitis and I didn't have to see him so frequently. But whenever I went to see him he looked so happy that I tried to see him as much as I could. However about a half a year later I came to be very busy and I couldn't go to see him so often. One day when I went to his bed to see him after a long interval and his name had disappeared. I asked a nurse where he was and I found he had died a few weeks ago. I was so depressed. I should have made time to see him. Although I had a lot of work at that time I could have asked someone for help. When I talked about him with the nurse she told me he had wanted to see me. I thought she could have called me and told me about that. If I had known he was getting worse and he wanted to see me I would have tried to see him. Since then I always try to keep in mind the fact that I have many patients but to one patient I may be the only doctor who takes care of him.
