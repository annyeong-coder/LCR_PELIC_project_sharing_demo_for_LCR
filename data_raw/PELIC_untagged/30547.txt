First of all the perspective is different. In the text ''Leisurville'' author shares with us his own experience therefore we can feel his view and expressions. It is narrative. In the text ''Choosing to Be Different'' author only give us some information. It seems to me like an educational article. Point of view is different as well. In ''Choosing to Be Different'' author s purpose is showing how people can chose to live differently I mean the way how to live apart. But in the ''Leisurville'' author s target is to demonstrate how artificial 'Disneyland s life' is for senior citizens.
