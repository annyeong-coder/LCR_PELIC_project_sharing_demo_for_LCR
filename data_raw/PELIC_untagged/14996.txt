I met my boyfriend Thiago one week after to met his mother first. I went in Pier 1 store four months ago with my mother. Obvious we talking in portuguese and my boyfriend's mother hear us and she had talking together because she is brasilian too she gave us all numbers that her family included Thiago. After he calls me and we hang out to dinner somtething like friends. He very nice and I had discovered that he works in front of my apartament and a lot of things than we liked. He was my friend first and after two months we dating and my relation ship now doing very well.
