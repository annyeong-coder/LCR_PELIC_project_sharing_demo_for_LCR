My best friend who is called Rosita has been my friend since we were in elementary school. Rosita studied in the same school where I did. We were classmates during more than 10 years when we enjoyed a lot together. Rosita who is now an accounting works for a company in Maracaibo where she studied her bachelor. She is a friend whose personality gets along with mine. We used to go out every time and have fun with friends that studied with us at school. Right now Rosita is making plans to come to Pittsburgh where I am sure we will have fun. Also we are planning to go to New York City which environment is exited and cosmopolitan. The airline company that she will use for flying is American Airlines. Rosita will talk to her father whose credit card is needed to afford this trip. I am just waiting for her visit next November when will be a nice weather.
