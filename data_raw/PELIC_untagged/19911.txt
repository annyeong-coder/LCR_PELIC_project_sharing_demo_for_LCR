I think it is significant for parents to pass on cooking skills to their children. First of all Children have to know that it's never easy thing to make every meal carefully for them. Children get to know the efforts of their parents naturally by challenging the long process of cooking. It might also let them realize that they should not waste food even some food is not too attractive. Second passing on parents' cooking skills is associated with passing on their tradition because it is a gathering of some slight habits done in home. Food is one of the most important parts capable of making cultures be continued for a long time. All in all it should be encouraged that parents get their children to learn their cooking skills.
