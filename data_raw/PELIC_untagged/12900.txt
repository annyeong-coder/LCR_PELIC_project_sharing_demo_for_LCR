To my next ELI semester mates First of all you must be very curios of the English Language Institute classes here and may want to know how the student life is. For me in summer term here I have had a lot of fun of studying with my classmates and teachers and got many experience in Pittsburgh. The important thing is I ought to speak English more instead of speaking my native language Mandarin. For you guys that should be the same thing. I guess you might want to promote your speaking skill in English. Please try to speak more English with the native speakers in America. As a result of months later you will have acquired more than what you want.
