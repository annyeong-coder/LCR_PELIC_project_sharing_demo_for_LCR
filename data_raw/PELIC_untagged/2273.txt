When I failed to go to the university I decided to try again. To improve myself just in a year I went to big city Seoul. There were many academies in Seoul for someone who want to retry to go to the university and I registered one of those academies. I was living in private dormitory near the academy while I was studying and there are about 50 students like me. We could be close in short time because we lived together when we had hard time leaving our home and studying all day even on weekends. But we depended on each other and though it wasn't happy condition we tried to make us happy. For example even some of us escaped the dorm at Saturday night because we really wanted to watch some movies. After the big test fortunately we got a goal that we wanted. It was just 1 year but many memories in that time led us the best firends.
