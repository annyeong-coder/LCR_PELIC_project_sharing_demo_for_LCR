In the end of 2007 there was a survey ranked the worldwide top 20 from Forbe of the U. S magazine. Taipei was the top 7 in the list and just lower than Shajan which located in China. Is Taipei overcrowded in this small island According to the data from Forbe Taipei has high populations which have affected residents' daily life including air pollution which let people infected threatening living traffic problems and overcrowding plots and office buildings in the metropolitan city. There is no word to say the mayor city has never fixed it. At least based on the situation we got we had some solutions to deal with these issues that reveal something visible on restorative infrastructure alternative transportations and urban planning. First of all air pollution is the serious problem that we have and has been threatening our life for many years. Second problem is traffic jams especially in peak hours. The finally one is overcrowding plots and office buildings in the metropolitan city. In short for our city's own good we should fix some problems from our neighborhood in daily and try it best. Meanwhile facing the dilemma of the overcrowding city Taipei we hope our government try more effects to promote well.
