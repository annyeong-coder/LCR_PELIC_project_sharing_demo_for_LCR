Having had a promotion at work my father earn a high salary. After getting a scholarship from the government my sister went to study in China. While celebrating his ninth birthday my little brother received a lot of gifts. When asked about his journey in Australia my cousin said it was a service mission from his ministry. Before getting married my brother were going with many women. The period when he got his first car bought after one year of saving money my uncle got a accident. Before allowing that my father leave the village my grand father made a traditional ceremony to protect him against bad spirits. Since making fashionable and nice dresses my aunt saw her customers increased.
