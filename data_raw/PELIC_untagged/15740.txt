A few weeks ago there were so many furniture in my room so I had to decide to throw away some of them. Before I threw them out I looked them over to classify what is really needed for me. I also picked out a bright colored curtain and hanged it up on the wall. From that time my house was totally changed it cheered me up. When I went back to my home I found out myself being comfortable. Now it is well arranged and straightened up because I never put off cleaning my house. Although it is very hard to clean the house regularly it is worth trying out.
