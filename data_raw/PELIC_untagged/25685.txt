Semiconducting industry and bio technology have been developing for twenty years by my goverment in Taiwan. These jobs required graduate school students in the aspects of science and engineer. I have just studied physics so I am a research and development by occupation. My assignment is integrating these techniques because they had been independent researched before. Moreover I must often absorb technology information which have been written in English. Therefore I hope to advance in my field by improving English and learning new information.
