Haste makes waste because every thing needs step to step. If you save some time the base will not hard. Result will be defeated. The waste is not only time. It is such as me. I always want to fast. But I usually forget something when I am quick. Once my favorite movie would come on. But I must cook. So I decided I cook as soon as possible. I used the strongest firepower and the least water. Finally I finished cook before the movie start. But my dinner was too bad. Outside of food had burn inside was still crude. And I forgot add salt. I was very hungry when I was watching movie. This is a lesson. If you want successful you should not hasten. Haste will waste your time and money and stuff.
