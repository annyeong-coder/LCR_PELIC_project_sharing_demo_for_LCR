Maybe synesthesia can make my life more exciting if I have it. I think that synesthesia can show me various aspects of the world that I have never known until now such as flavors of words colors of flavors physical feeling of music and colors of letters. During reading this article I really wondered how the synesthetes feel this world. According to the textbook the synesthetes have some differences in their brains. It points out the fact that the synesthesia is a special and unique ability or a gift rather than an illness even though newest technology can not explain the factors that cause it. Of course many people are skeptical about synesthesia and this fact can make the synesthetes feel isolated. However I think it is just a small toll to have more interesting world. Also the synesthesia does not make people sick or stupid. I think it is possible that the synesthetes get along with people well if they keep the secret and just enjoy their ability.
