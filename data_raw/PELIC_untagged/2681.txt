How to Fail A Test How to fail a test In my opinion it is too easy to fail a test. If you want to fail it absolutely you can if you do not absolutely you can. There are many ways to fail a test. I'm going to write about it. The most important way to fail or get a low grade is if you neglect the study or that class that you will take a test in it. For example if you have a test tomorrow and you don't study at all it is normal to fail the test because you are neglected. Do not trust your self if you do not trust your ability I mean if you are a pessimist you will not pass the test. For example if you are studying and you say ohh it is too hard I cannot understand it it's a big problem. My advice for you readers is to trust your self and be an optimistic. Finally all of us can pass the tests all of us have the ability it's true that every one have a special abilities but this doesn't mean that they just can pass the test and we are not. Study hard and try to do some of my advices. I promise that you will be better.
