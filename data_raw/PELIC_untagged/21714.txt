The best meal I have ever had was in my country. One day I prepared barbeques. I bought pieces of meat and some vegetables. I mixed them together with a lot of spices. After that I flamed enough amount of coal. At the end the food was delicious. Also my friends shared with cans of soda and bowls of steamed rice and some plates of appetizers. After we finished some of us drank cups of tea and others ate some fruits.
