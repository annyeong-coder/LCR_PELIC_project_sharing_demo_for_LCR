I had a problem in writing checks. In Korea we don't use check the same way Americans use. We get a check when we ask in bank. So it made me confused to write a check in a check sheet. Because it was a first time to use a check I looked up internet. I chose a site that shows the example of checks which are filled out. It is more easy to me to see the completed check than read the way to fill out the check. Justin Pritchard 30. 10. 2008 ANON URLPAGE
