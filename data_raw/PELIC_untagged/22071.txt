When I were walking on the street a girl asked me what was the time. Then 2 days later it was the first day of the high school. I saw the girl again and I asked her if she remembered me. She remembered. Finally we were in the same class. Both of us were excited that we made friends on the first day. How luck we were we were deskmates. One day she was calling me while I was having a shower. I missed her call then I called her again. She wanted to invite me to her birthday party. I was happy. I decided to buy a gift to her. While I putting on my shirt it was raining. It stopped raining after I have waited for 3 hours. Then I went to mall and chose a little toy as a gift.
