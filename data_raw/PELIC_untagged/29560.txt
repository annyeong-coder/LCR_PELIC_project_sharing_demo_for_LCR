Dumplings is one of my favorite types of food. To make dumplings first you need to make dough then you can choose a meat filling to put in. Finally put the raw dumpling in boiling water after twenty minutes you can enjoy them. I use 1. 5 Pounds of flour 1 teaspoon of salt 1 whole egg and 2 caps of water to make the dough. My favorite meat filling is a combination of 2 pounds of ground meat a pound of raw shrimp 3 teaspoons of sesame oil a cup of water 2 egg whites a pinch of gingle 3 branch of green onion 10 drops of wine some salt.
