According to the author there are many creativity killers such as evaluation competition and pressure in school but we teachers parents etc. Have not noticed or we think that it is not a big deal. At first or second year of school children are excited to explore the new environment but Adults do not care that what children is interest in. In my personal experience when I was in the first year of the elementary school I was curious to savor new experience and to make new friends. Therefore I did a lot of things which teachers thought that was stupid and I was getting to be inhibited to experience the stupid things that I felt interesting. When I was in the fourth year of school A lot of homework and tests were given. I was being evaluated and controlled. I was getting to know how to win a reward and be liked by adults. How Got a good grade and did everything for being a good student. Gradually I did not know what I want how I think and why I live. I do not want to walk a comfortable way that others have prepared for me. To summarize the adults sometimes kill children's creativity and they never know. Because they want children to do and to learn children always have no right to say no.
