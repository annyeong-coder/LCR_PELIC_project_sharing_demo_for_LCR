I don't remember the worst meal experience and also I can't say a meal this is the best meal experience for me. Because Turkish cuisine has many delicious meals. But I can describe a nice Turkish meal. It's called BOREK. Borek is a dish making by a dough and meat or cheese. First you need to have a paper thin dough by a rolling pin. Between every paper thin dough you need to spead well melted butter. After 5 6 times you do put meat or vegetable mixture in it. Than cover the ingredients with 5 6 times dough. And replicate the same process as before. Later spead two egg and butter mixture on it. After cooking at the oven it's ready to eat.
