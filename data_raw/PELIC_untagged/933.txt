Someone may argue that natural resources play a significant role in the economy of a country. However I believe that education is more important to a nation's wealth than natural resources because the country consists of people. The development of human civilization is originated in education that brings up human resource. For example as we know some countries like Japan and Singapore are natural resources poor but they are still rich from their human resources. In addition Chinese idiom says to cultivate trees it takes ten years to educate people it takes hundreds of years. So to educate the people government should establish a systematic education policy not only concentrate on the current advantages. Turnabout and Relevant quotation
