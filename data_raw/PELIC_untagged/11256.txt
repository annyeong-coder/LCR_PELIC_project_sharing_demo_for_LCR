My younger sister is 19 years old and she is only my sister. She is my sister best friend and the closest person together. My sister is somebody who I like the most in the world. I will try to place her into one or more categories. If I had to say what king of personality she is I would say that she is an extrovert sensor and feeler. She is everywhere where is fun and a lot of people. She is a person whose energies are activated by being with others. When she starts to smile everybody around her is smiling too. She is like sunflower because she opens to the world people friend family most of the time with her lovely smile and sweet heart. I can say that she is also judger because she is a kind of person who likes to make decisions and has things settled. Barborka is my sister whom I respect and I want to be always with her when she needs me.
