Our trip to Frasan Island Ten years ago my friend's ANON_NAME_0 and I were interested in going to Frasan Island which is located in west southern region of Saudi Arabia. Frasan Island is scary jungle and it has many kind of wild animals. We prepared to take some stuff with us such as fresh water ax matches fishing equipment and compass. We started to go to Frasan Island by the small boat and when we were on the way we prepare the fishing equipment and started to fishing some fish for the dinner and return some of them back to the sea. We also used a compass to find the right direction. After we get there we did not enough fresh water and we started to cut some woods by the ax and we gathered them and ignited the fire by the matches for making the dinner. At this time we heard the wolf and we slept a little bit in this night. One day later we went back to the city and it was scary trip and interested story
