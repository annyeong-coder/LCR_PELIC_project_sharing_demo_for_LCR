I was born in Chang won. Also I grew up there. When I was 20 years old American age was 18 years old I met my boy friend. He was my friend's friend. I have fallen in love with him. I have met my boyfriend since 2007. He changed me everything that I haven't been do things. When we weren't a high school student we wore a uniform. Then we went a beach. That was so fun. Every cost was student's rate. Actually that is illegal. I have traveled Orlando. I went the Disney World and Sea World. I have seen 'The Shama Show'. It was a Killer whale show. I have used a cup of Cinderella. It has been my treasure. I can't forget Orlado.
