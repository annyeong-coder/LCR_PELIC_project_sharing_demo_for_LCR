I live in Kuwait. Kuwait is located in middle east between Iraq an Saudi Arabia. Kuwait is borded by Iraq from the north and south by Saudi Arabia. Kuwait has been considered on a beach coast. Our culture based on democracy. All people can complain about rules. The rules are came from the citizen. They candidate an eligible people to guide their rules and make the social in Kuwait perform better whether with their work or their social interaction. People in Kuwait like their cuisine so much as they daily eat rice mixed with meat whether its white meat or red meat and the meat should be spiced up really well. Kuwait is a beautifule and democratic countrey. If you are interested with restaurants elegance clothes nice beach and have a relaxation time you will definitely find it.
