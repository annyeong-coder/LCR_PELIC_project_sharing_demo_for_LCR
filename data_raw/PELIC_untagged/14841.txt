In my opinion movies are a good way to know about different countries. Foreign movies have been encouraged the reflection of different cultures. Even though movies might be talk mainly about the subjects or main ideas it is also demonstrate some customs and life style through indirect target. Moreover in some countries movies could help the foreign people how to learn the dealing with citizen people in those countries. Now movies have a lot of advantages that might support any country to show its customs and cultures.
