The authors of The Creative Spirit believe that every child have a creative point of view to recognize new things. They attend schools full of energy and desire to discover new world but year after year they start loosing this desire because of exposing to one or more of creativity killers such as being observed all the time being restricted by the class time and being worried about the grades. In my perspective I completely agree with the authors' opinion. I remembered when I was in the elementary school the teacher showed us a piece of art and our task was to try to copy it. She refused or even punished if any students added or omitted something and she could not understand that it is difficult for any child to copy adults' work. So she always said that I never could be an artist or sculptor. When I grew up I understood why she said that. She said that because she buried my desire to create things and developed the ability to imitate others' work.
