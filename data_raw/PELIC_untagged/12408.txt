My last tripe was in last summer I went to natural please were are trees and grass lands there is clear air. I smelled a good air. I did not listen any noise. In the night I looked to the sky to the stars and the moon . Some times I see some animals like rabbits or foxes. And often I stay few time to see the small insects like an ant or a bee I saw how it works hard. The ant or the bee work to collect the food in the summer to the weter. In the morning I looked to the sun when it rising. So I think the cooking in the natural pleases more delicious than the houses. I spend good times and I did not for get this moments.
