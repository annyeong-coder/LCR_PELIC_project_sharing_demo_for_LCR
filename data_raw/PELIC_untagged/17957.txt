My father in law had a difficult childhood. He grew up in a next country. That was hard process for him. Because his father worked in the foreign country. He had 2 younger sisters and brother. One day Their family has to move to another area by taking a mule. My father in law has to assist his sistars and brothers because he is the oldest son in his family. At that time it was a terrible environment on the road. But there is no available way to go to other country. So his younger sister fall down from the higher space on their way to other town. And she passed away. That is really sad story for him.
