Dear Karina How are you I hope that everything is ok. I'm thinking to buy the digital camera that I told you by telephone last week. I have two good options a digital camera and a photographic camera. Today is easier and practice the digital cam because we can see the photo at time that we take the picture and we can delete or no. In addiction we can first past to the computer and then decide whish photo we want to print. That is the advantages to buy a digital camera. The other kind of camera the photographic cam has similar price but doesn't have the advantages as the digital cam. The photographic cam isn't practice and functional as the other one. So I think the best decision is to buy a digital camera. If you were here you could help me in my decision but that's ok you can tell me you opinion by telephone because I'll just buy the camera in a few months. So I'm gonna wait for your answer ok I love you dear sister Love
