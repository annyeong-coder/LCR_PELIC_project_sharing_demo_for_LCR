In the beginning children have a lot passion and interest. Therefore education used grade and competition to limited children. Children received heavy evaluation pressure that will reduce their interest. Agree. In our country we have the education problem. Our education was tough us that study is only way to achieve the goal. Everyone have to attend college our social value become strange. I think every students have their own abilities we should not just used school evaluation to grade them self. Everyone have their position and value in the society.
