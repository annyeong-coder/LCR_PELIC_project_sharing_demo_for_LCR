Many Korean are enthusiastic in World Cup. When I watched soccer games in 2002 I realized that sports are valuable to society because they provide entertainment. Many people enjoyed watching soccer games even people who work in a company. They needed a rest without stress so it was good for them. Most students also enjoyed watching the games. After they finished their school they wanted to watch the games with their friends or family. Although they had to go to school the next day they didn't sleep to watch the games. Even teachers were excited. In society most people need entertainment to forget about stress. Since sports make people get out of stress sports are really good opportunities for people who like them.
