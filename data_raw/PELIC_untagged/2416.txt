The word of Love is hard for me to say. I don't use this word so much and it's a bit awkward to tell someone about it. But thinking about my entire life I have used this word once to only one person who isn't my family or friends. There was one boy I felt some special feeling for. First I didn't have any feelings about him and he was just my friend. We were good friends like my girl friends who are closed to me. After time passes I realized that I had been having feelings for him for a few months. I still don't know why I was like that but I think it's because we shared a lot of ideas thoughts and our personal things and we talked many times even though we weren't in the same place. We talked so many things not only simple conversations but also some issues in the world or something like this. So I could know him much better and it made me be into him. Until now he is still a special person to me even though we couldn't be well. He's the first person who taught me what the love is except my family and friends. I think I won't probably forget him for my life even if I don't get in touch him.
