The Eating Habits in the U. S. And in Taiwan Indent The United States is a country in the North American continent and Taiwan is a country in the Asian continent. There are so many differences between these two countries such as weather location races e usually eat cereal as their breakfast because it's convenient and easy to prepare. However there are some experts indicate that the nutrition of cereal is not high enough for a breakfast. On the other hand Taiwanese eats plenty of food as our breakfast. In a traditional breakfast store we can find different kinds of food are served as breakfast. For example we may order a small rice roll a cup of soy milk and an egg as our breakfast. We believe that we need to eat a lot in our first meal to get the energy for a whole day. Indent Third the taste of food is also different in the U. S. And in Taiwan. I think many Americans eat saltier or sweeter food than the Taiwanese because most of the time I think the meal is a little salty for me when I eat outside. Moreover I still hear some customers ask for some extra soy sauce for them to take out. On the other hand if I buy chocolate here I usually find the taste is too sweet for me. However the taste is different from different people after I discussed this with my Taiwanese friends who are studying in the U. S. They also have the same opinion as mine. Thus I think the taste of food is really different in these two countries. Indent As mentioned above there are many different eating habits in the U. S. And in Taiwan. It is totally different living customs that cause the difference. However there is no good answer about which kind of eating habit are correct or not. Therefore we should learn which is good and suitable for us and try to improve our eating habits to make them become better.
