I am planning to get married next may 2007 in my home country with my family and friends. My plan is start from here Pittsburgh because I have to add my wife to my I 20 and reserve an appointment in the embassy of the United State of America in Riyadh. It will take time to get the visa which will be the problem I'll face it and it let my fianc to study computer since or computer programming. I am going to study at the engineering college in the mechanical department and I hope to pass the interview and joined them there at that college. After all I hope to every body happy life with their families and I hope to finish my wife visa as soon as possible to join me and both of us joined the happy families with our own life.
