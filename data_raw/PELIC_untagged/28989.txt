14 Nov 2010 ANON_NAME_0 Kinds of Students Students are the most important element in the education process. However students are not equal in their behaviors so there are two kinds of students good and bad. The first kind of students is good. Hard working student is a good student because he does a big effort in his study. He works hard and does impossible things to obtain a good mark. For example every day he comes to the school early. He prepares himself to the lecture and participates in the class. In addition good student is considerate. He respects student's desires and thinks to give a good feeling to them. For instance he respects his teacher through the attendance and uses a respectful and appropriate dealing with her him. He assists his classmate when he needs help. The second kind of students is the bad. Bad here means he has abnormal behavior so we can see a careless student who comes to the school late. He doesn't manage his time to come early. Also he doesn't do the homework and class activities. Beside we see another type of bad students called noisy student. This student doesn't commit good manners when he talks with his classmate. He talks a lot so he is a talkative. He interrupts his teacher during the lecture. To sum up the students over all the world aren't similar so there are good and bad students. In my opinion every teacher can distinguish between these kinds by evaluate them.
