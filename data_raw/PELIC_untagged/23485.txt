Before 3 weeks I saw film. The film was cop out. The film talk about to cops and they want to catch a criminal actually the film is action and comedy at the same time. At the beginning the film was so funny and excited after half an hour the film was boring I disappointed because I really want to know what will happen in the end. After 2 hour the film was so confusing about the to cops the surprise was that the to cops catch the criminal after a big time of fighting and shooting guns against each other finally in the and I was exciting and to know if there is part 2 of the film.
