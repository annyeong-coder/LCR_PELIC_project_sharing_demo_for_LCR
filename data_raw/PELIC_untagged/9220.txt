The information in the diagrams might affect the way I give feedback to others in this way I will always try to make praise. Accordingly to the two diagrams praise installs confidence confidence conduct to high standards which will assure strong results. However unsatisfying feedback installs a lack of confidence which implies hesitant attempts and then poor results. Therefore to give a constructive feedback I think it is better to give a praise than an unsatisfying feedback.
