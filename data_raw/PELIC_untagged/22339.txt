Hello I am Rocio Last Name and I have been doing this site with the objective to introduce myself to you. I born in Argentina that is a country in South America. Since I was a child I have liked to listen to music and dance. In addition I have learned how to dance ballet salsa and a lot of different kind of dancing but I never learned tango which is the most traditional dancing in my country. I know this is not rational and unbelievable even though this is the true. Also I like diving and I did a diving course when I was in High School. I attribute this special achievement to my father. However I have not been doing sports for a long time.
