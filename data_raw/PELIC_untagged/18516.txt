When I worked at company I spend a lot of money to buy new clothes. Now I am faced money problem. I don't have money to pay next semester tuition fee. I shouldn't have bought clothes. I should have saved my salary constantly. At this time I lived with my parents. My mother might have warned me because she knew I was shopaholic. Last week I asked my boyfriend to borrow his money but he turned it down. He couldn't have refused my offer.
