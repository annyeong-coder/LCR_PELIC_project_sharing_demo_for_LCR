Which is a better pet a cat or a dog Many people keep pets to enjoy life together. Cats and dogs are the most popular pets. Cats and dogs are very different in many ways and they also have common things. For me s cat is a perfect pet. It's difficult to make a decision but you may choose one after knowing their features. Cats and dogs have several common things. First of all both animals have good sizes for pets. It is easy to play and live with them because they aren't big like hippos and they aren't small like ants. Then one more good reason is their living space. They can live in our houses so we don't need to prepare big pools or caves for them. Next their appearance is so cute. Moreover it's obvious they can heal us after we watch their action with furry shapes. We can see differences between cats and dogs. First their instincts are different. For example dogs are pretty loyal because they used to belong to a pack and lived together under a leader's control so they follow their masters' orders. In contrast cats have been loners they've decided everything by themselves. They don't care about their masters but they are loyal to their feeders. Dogs will ask you to play together but you will ask cats to play together. As for taking care of them dogs are worse than cats. For example dogs need to walk with their keepers and they can't clean up their own bodies. Furthermore they can't take care of their own waste. Dogs' keepers need to help them. In contrast cats need much less care than dogs. They walk alone clean up their own bodies themselves and bury their own waste. In conclusion we keep pets because we want to add a little bit of fun for to our lives. For these reasons I prefer cats over dogs because I have a busy life and I can't take lots of time for a pet. Some people love dogs but for me I always choose a cat as a pet.
