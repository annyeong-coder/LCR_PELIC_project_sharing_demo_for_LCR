I visited Las Vegas August this year. I went to their with my family. I walked with my family and took many good pictures in their. I saw the fountains water show in Las Vegas. The water show played with quiet music. That was very beautiful show I like that very much. I ate some good food in their. There were many gambling houses in Las Vegas. But I'm 19 so I couldn't gamble. My family and I were very happy at that time.
