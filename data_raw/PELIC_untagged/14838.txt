I had a car accident six year ago when I went to the beach with my friends. When I had been driving on the highway I was crashed by another car. Then my car was fallen into a small canal. My friends and I hurry out from the car. I was helped by people around there. My car was completely demolished. After that a police came. I was asked many questions by the police. The car that crashed my car had been escaped at that time. I was very shocked. After that accident I didn't drive for one month.
