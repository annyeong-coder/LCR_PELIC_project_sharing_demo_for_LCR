Before I came the USA I have never lived along in a narrow apartment. Also I have never used crated cart it is anew experience for me I mean I didn't shop or buy anything online. It is comfortable to save my time. Other thing I haven't don before is omit playing soccer I used to play it day after day but now I can not play soccer because I don't have free time to do that. In addition to live along and put off soccer I have never played American football I played three times during I had been in Pittsburgh. It's difficult for me to understand it. But I hope to understand it as soon as possible.
