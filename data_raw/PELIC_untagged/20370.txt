The five things I would take if I were going to be shipwrecked are First I will take an ax to cut the trees in the island and to make a fire to prepare the food. And to reprepare ocean water to make it fit to drinking. The second thing I will take a cooking pot to prepare some see food from the ocean. Third I will take with me some fire works because when I see ship on the ocean I will play it. Also I will take a compass to I know where I am and which direction I should go. Last thing I will take many matches. Because I will need it to make a fire to cook some food and to play the fireworks when isee any ship.
