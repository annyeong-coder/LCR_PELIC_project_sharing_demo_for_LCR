Five month ago I have learned from my experience to follow my intuition. Looking back on the situation I wish I hadn't moved from that apartment. I lost many facilities which were available in that apartment. If I had lived in that apartment I would have done the laundry without leaving the convenient of my apartment. But today I have to share the laundry room with my neighbors. If I had stayed in that apartment I would have attended my first class in time because now I have to take two buses. If I had not moved from that apartment I would have been happier.
