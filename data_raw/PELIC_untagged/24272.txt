When I was 10 years old I couldn't read books about philosophy but now I can read books about philosophy. I was able to run quickly but now I can't run quickly. I wasn't able to cook very well now I can cook different dishes. When I was 10 years old I could play Tamgara but now I can practice other sports. When I was a child I was able to create unknown worlds but now my imagination can't easily dream of unknown worlds.
