After I had graduated from a college I joined one of the special schools in my country. When I joined at this school I taught English subject for primary classes. By the time I was principal teacher about English's activity in mother's party. I had already picked up all things that I need in party. I had been training my students to sing mother's song perfectly for two weeks. Before a party started we had been practicing in a yard of school. My students had been super singers so I had felt so happy.
