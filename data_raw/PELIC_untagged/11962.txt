I am Ricardo and as my Spanish name suggests I am from a small country in South America named Ecuador. According to my mother she gave me this name because my grandfather urged her to name his first grandson like him. When I was young I read about the meaning of my name and I found that it was related with kings power and bravery. I have a special interest about learning English and getting a Master Degree in the United States. My life is not only studying I also like to spend my time listening romantic music seeing plays watching movies especially movies about real life . I play basketball two times each week and I have usually run 4 miles every day since I came here. I am 36 years old and my plans for the near future are getting a good job finding the love and enjoying the time with my family and friends.
