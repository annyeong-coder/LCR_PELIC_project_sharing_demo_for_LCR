About one week ago classes from the ELI had an outing trip to Cleveland. We took a bus for our trip on the way to Cleveland we stopped at a rest stop and everyone could have ten minutes break. Meanwhile I and other ELI students came back to the bus early one student started to push each other in the aisle area on the bus. We should not have pushed each other to have fun. Suddenly a guy who seated apposite from me pushed my forehead. For his rude attack action was really unexpected I automatically slapping back on his face. I thought. Oh my God! I should not have done that. I could have prevented this happening. What a mistake!! I could have remained at that time. I ought not to have reacted to him right away such violent manner. I could have warned him and told him that I felt really insulted. On the other hand he might have thought that his action was not a big deal. So perhaps my defensive slap may have justified. Nevertheless I wonder. Maybe I should have handled things differently last Saturday. I felt so terrible. Anyway hopefully I should not have slapped anyone for rest of my life.
