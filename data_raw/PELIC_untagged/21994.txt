While I am planning on taking a trip with my friend I need to tell anyone about my plans. First I will write down my own procedure. Making a list of something I prepare to do about this trip. Those contain a digital camera a flashlight cell phone a small first aid kit a lot of water and enough food during a trip. Then I check the boat equipment or engine if prepare appropriately to an island and bring lots of oil with boat. At the same time I have to check the weather how the day is. I can take a little clothing sunglasses and umbrella and put tent in my backpack. Finally I always bring the map of on a trip if you can't find it. I must to be a guide is responsible for arranging for anything. The planning list can let me be safe.
