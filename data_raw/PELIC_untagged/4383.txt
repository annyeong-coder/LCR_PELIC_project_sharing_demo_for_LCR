I've read many good paragraphs since I started to study English. I recognized that a good paragraph is organized very well. So I think organized and paragraph is easy to look at and understand what an author's saying. First of all a composition is important to organize opinions. Even though there are some grammar mistakes in the paragraph a good composition makes the paragraph arranged. Secondly indent and margin space can also help the paragraph look arranged. So readers can understand the author's opinion easily. Finally the author should put a topic sentence with details such as reasons or examples. Because even if the author gives readers the topic sentence clearly it's too hard to understand the author's opinion without any details. Therefore I think a good paragraph has to be looked clearly and it also has an exact topic sentence with more than one detail.
