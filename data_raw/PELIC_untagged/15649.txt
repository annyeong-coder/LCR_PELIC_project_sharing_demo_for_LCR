On day my friend decided to go journy at local place. It was sound good for me. But if the time could have been back I had not gone with them. The way to reach that place is so difficult. While on our way we stuke in the sand because we went in small car so if we had gone in four wheel car we could have stuke in the sand. After we spent more than hours trying to get rid of this woe I wished that I could have accepted to go with them.
