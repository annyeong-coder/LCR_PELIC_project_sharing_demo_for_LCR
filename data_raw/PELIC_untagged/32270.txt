One day I heard a funny story about a blind man in Texas. There was a blind man who was making his first trip to Texas. How this happened is something that he was seated next to a Texan on the flight and the Texan spent a lot of time telling him how everything is bigger in Texas. By the time the blind man reached a large hotel and he was very excited about being in Texas. The long trip had worn him out so he decided to stop at the bar for a small soda before going up to his room. When the waitress served his drink he thought that it was in a huge mug because he is in Texas. After drinking such a large amount He asked the waitress where a restroom was. She told him to turn left at the register and it would be the second door on the right. He reached the first door and continued down the hall. A few steps later he missed the second door and went through the 3rd door instead. Then he didn't realize that he entered the swimming area. What the next happen was he walked forward and fell into the swimming pool. He suddenly remembered that everything is bigger in Texas. What he finally started shouting was Don't flush! Don't flush!
