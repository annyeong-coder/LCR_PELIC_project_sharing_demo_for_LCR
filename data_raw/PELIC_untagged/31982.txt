When I got married I thought with my wife put every old things in a time capsule. We put the capsule in a small storage at home. The capsule contains many things. Forexampel some old coins and stamps. When we travelled to Egypt I bought an old ring and nickels for my wife. I put a lot of photos for me when I was child. In capsule few old watches and little sand I bought it from Jordon in 2005.
