McCrae and his colleagues developed a questionnaire that is called NEO PI R used to evaluate real and perceived personalities. They conducted 3 groups of NEO PI R surveys two of them were previously collected in a wide variety of countries that can reflect volunteers own personalities and personalities of other individuals they knew and a third survey in about 50 countries that reflecting national stereotype. They compared these profiles and found that in most countries two profiles based on real people's information matched well however they were very different from stereotype profile.
