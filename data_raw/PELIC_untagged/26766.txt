Hello OSS hope you are doing well. I am student from Saudi Arabia. I graduated from King ANON_NAME_0 University in 2009. I was working in Jazan University as demonstrator in physical therapy department. Currently I am studying English in ELI at University of Pittsburgh and I would like to start studying to continue my education in same university. However I am honored to study at University of Pittsburgh because of its excellent reputation. In fact I got a conditional acceptance to study for one year at Physical therapy department.
