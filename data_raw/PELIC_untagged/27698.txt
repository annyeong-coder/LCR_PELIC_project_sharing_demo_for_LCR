I live in a a nice apartment. My apartment has one bed room and a small kitchen and a big living room. I always enjoy decorate my living room by cover up the scratches on the wall by hanging some posters up. Also I like to change the decoration by moving the chairs around. Moreover I think it would be nice to hung up a mirror in front of the door. Likewise I like to turn on some music to fell more liveliness. Also I like to clean the apartment by throw the garbage away and put the book back on the book shelf. If I could make changes in my apartment I would like to tear the kitchen wall down and the living room will look more bigger than before.
