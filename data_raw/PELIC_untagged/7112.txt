My best friend Haejin who is an elementary school teacher is my life friend. We went to the same high school and she went to University in Pusan whoes college was near by my university. Therefore we easyly met each other. She is a person who is kind warm and supportive. Even though she and I are the same age she always cheer me up. This is one reason for which I respect her.
