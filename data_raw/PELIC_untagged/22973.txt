My apartment in the USA is smaller than my apartment in Saudi Arabia. I like it but now I have to stay away from some of my old habit. For example I can't leave my shoes out I can't turn up the music as I want and I can't clean my clothes up in my apartment. In the other way now I count on myself to clean up my apartment and throw out the garbage. Also I don't have to think over the gas and the electricity. But I turn off the light to avoid burn it down. I think my new apartment turned my habit over.
