My profession require many skills to be able to ensure high level of performance. As a teacher for Arabic a second language I must obtain a high understanding to language and how languages work because the needs to transfer this knowledge to students. Another skill that I must have to know how to use the technology in my classes such as Power Point or using Online system to submit homework or even sending receiveing E mails. To work in this too skills I started to prepare to take a master degree in Applied Linguistics so I can have more knowledge in that field I also worked to improve my skills in computer and I took the ICDL classes and certificate.
