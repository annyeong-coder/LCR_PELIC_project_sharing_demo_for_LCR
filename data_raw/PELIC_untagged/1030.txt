October23 2006 Dear Dad I am going to get a driver's license within the next few weeks but I'm still thinking about whether I want a car or a motorcycle. I can tell you some information about both of this two things. First cars are more comfortable and safer than motorcycles because cars have airconditioning and big seats but the most important thing is we sit in the car not like motorcycles where we have to sit outside. Second if the roads have snow it will be very hard to ride the motorcycle. I think also it will be very cold when you are riding the motorcycle outside. Third a car is more expensive than a motorcycle. So. . . What do you think Dad please give me some suggestions. . . Love
