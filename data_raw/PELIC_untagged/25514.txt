When I was in high school I used to drink milk everyday. But now I drink coffee everyday. My best friend Zi Ling is my classmates. She is come from Taiwan too. We used to speak Taiwanese when we had secret. We used to cut out hair together. We used to have long straight hair. But now I have long curly hair and she has short hair. We used to be together all the time. Now we can't be together all the time. Because we are in different country and we all busy in our life. I really miss her.
