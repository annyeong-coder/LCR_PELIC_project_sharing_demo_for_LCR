Having watched American football I perceived how much this sport is violent. It seems that players seek the strong contact as a form of improving their performance. The fans approve and the Tv show incentive this shape of sports. Even though I do not agree nor like I began to watch some games principally of Steelers which the team of Pittsburgh where I'm living. Watching this game with some friends American people I began to respect. After being learned about some specific rules then I understood more although I continued to not like the game. Even though I do not like I watched since I wanted to practice my English. Also I liked the party when Steelers plays. American Football as being the most famous sports of the United States we should at least respect.
