Since I was a child I had wished to work for the Swiss diplomacy. At the same time at home I have always had a strong education against any form of violence. That is why I decided not to do the army although I thought it would be better for my CV. Lately I have learned that to be accepted in the Foreign Service it is strongly recommended to be an Officer. If I had acted intuitively and done the army I would now have better chance to be accepted in the Foreign Service. Moreover if I had decided to stay longer and become Officer my chances would be even bigger. However given my values I don't wish I had taken an other decision. Indeed if my grades will be good enough I will be able to find a job related to the international relations ant the promotion of peace in the world.
