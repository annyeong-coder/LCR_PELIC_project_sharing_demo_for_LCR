Last year when I was walking on my neighborhood I saw a terrible accident. Father and son was playing soccer in the park that is surrounded by two streets with heavy traffic. The boy was only 5 years old. The ball was kicked by the father and it run to the street. The boy started running to catch the ball and he crossed the street without realizing it. A car was crossing the street at the same time and the boy was beaten in the head. The boy was crying very loud and immediately he was taken to the hospital. In the hospital the boy was examined by the doctors and fortunately he did not have major injuries. The boy was kept in the hospital for the next day of the accident to be sure that nothing happenned to him. The boy has been fine since the accident.
