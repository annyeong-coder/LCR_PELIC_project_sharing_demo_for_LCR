Three important areas of my life are my family friends and education. All families in my country want to have more than one boy so if I hadn't been born my parants would have been frustrated. They wanted to have a lot of childreen very much. If they hadn't had me they might have had depression. I have a lot of friends who met and know each other through me. If I hadn't been born they wouldn't have known each other. Also if they hadn't had me they might have felt something weird.
