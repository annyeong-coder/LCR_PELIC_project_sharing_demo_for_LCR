Mastering a musical instrument can take more than a decade of practice If we want to master a musical instrument we should practice it more than ten years. The more we practice it the more we can play the instrument well. I like to play music with some instruments for example play the piano trumpet or Indian harp. I started to play trumpet about six years ago and I played it everyday in Japan. Am I good player No still now I can't do it well and I want to play it better than now. The mastering instrument is really difficult and there is no way to do it easily. I know one horn player who has job in Tokyo symphony. He told me he was not a good player in the world. He said he was on the way to be a good player. I was surprised because he has really nice sound and nice sense. So I think mastering a musical instrument can take a lot of time.
