The cost of gasoline is high. The cost per one gallon is approximately 4. 00. When I came here on last July the cost was about 3. 00. For one year gasoline price is increasing about 25 . Why the cost of gasoline is high There are two main causes that the cost of gasoline is high first possible cause is too much consumption of gasoline because of growth of the world economy. Another possible cause is to depend on petroleum resource such as gasoline. First possible cause of the high cost of gasoline is too much consumption of gasoline in the industry. Recently international economy is growing. These affect gasoline consumption because almost of industrial power is based on gasoline. There are much consumption but supply is not. Therefore if there are much consumption and not enough supply the price will rise. For example China economy is growing rapidly so it needs more much gasoline to enforce new facilities and run it. Second possible cause of the high cost of gasoline is to rely on petroleum resource like gasoline. When we drive a car we use gasoline. Almost of hitting systems use gasoline in the house or company. Many of power come from gasoline. To decrease gasoline we should use alternative resource like solar energy and high efficienct products. For example there are hybrid cars. In conclusion the causes of high cost of gasoline are too much consumption of gasoline because of growth of the world economy and to depend on petroleum resource such as gasoline. In addition gasoline will be exhausted in the near future.
