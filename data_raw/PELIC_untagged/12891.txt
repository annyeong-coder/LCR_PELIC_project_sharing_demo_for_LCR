Mr. George W. Bush The White House Washington D. C. 20500 07 19 2008 Dear Mr. President My name is ANON_NAME_0 Last Name . I am writing this letter to tell you some very important information about current circumstance of the tobacco companies in the United States. Do you know the tobacco companies of our country are using different measures to attract foreign children to smoke They offer free cigarette for these foreign children advertise a lot in developing countries and even say that smoking is American life style to attract children who are curious of American life. Furthermore in order to get more benefits the United States Trade Representative also encourages these tobacco companies to explore oversea market. The USTR even threats foreign countries to open their cigarette market otherwise it will stop the economy and military assistance for them. Since the U. S. Government has decided in 1964 that cigarettes are a major cause of death and disease and discouraged smoking it's unfair to let more and more foreign children begin smoking. In order to enhance other countries' international impression to the United States I strongly suggest that you order the USTR to stop helping tobacco companies open cigarette markets overseas and prohibit tobacco advertising in other countries. Sincerely ANON_NAME_0 Last Name
