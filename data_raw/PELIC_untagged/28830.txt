Believing of many people said that a lot of women avoid studying science and technical subjects because of social pressure. However I disagree with that because many women are involved in science project and also women are considers better than men in work. I do not think most scientists and engineers are men because there is a study in Kuwait University says that the number of girls who applied on engineering and science subjects are doubled of the numbers of boys. Also there was an article about three girls who designed a new airport for their graduating project. That seems women are creative and not being restricted for any filed to study
