Hmm this is a good guestion. No not really because I do not like to try any kind of food tell I now how the make it like what they use with it the smell how is it and how is the food look after the make it because when I try something and I do not like it I get sick after I eat it. Sometimes when I want try something I have to ask him first and thinking of I would like it or not. This is my reason
