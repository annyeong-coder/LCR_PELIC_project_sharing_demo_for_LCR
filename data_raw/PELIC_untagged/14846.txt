The foreign movies are a good way to learn about a different country or culture. By developing the media industry people can easily meet with the foreign movies. It is a good opportunity for people to share their own culture by films. First of all people can travel in movies with watching the external culture. In the picture there are several parts of culture such as foods clothes houses and so on. Second movies show us the internal culture. Although we meet the different language we can feel the emotion of their culture. Last foreign films reflect the history of nation. I think that the most certain way to understanding the culture is to learn their history. For these reasons I agree that foreign movies are a good way to learn about a different country or culture.
