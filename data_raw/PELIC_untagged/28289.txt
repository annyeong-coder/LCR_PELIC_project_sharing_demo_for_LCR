My family have had some changes in the last years. We lived in a small city for 5 years. We have moved to the capital of my country since 1985. We lived in Egypt for 4 years. We enjoyed many vacation around the world. My sister has married since 2007 and she visited Egypt twice. She has been in Denver since 2009. I have lived in Pittsburgh for 3 months. My sister visited me last month. I was very happy when I saw her again. We have called our family once every week.
