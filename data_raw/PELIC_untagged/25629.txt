It is difficult to define the relationship between organized activity and individual creativity. It seems that most schools prefer focusing on organized activity rather than individual creativity because a school results from trend toward systematic education. As a result a school has a responsibility to promote cooperation and conformity to society's values. The problem is that how schools can reduce uniformity in education and encourage creativity in individual children. To address this problem more various methods to guide children are needed and grading students based on their reporting cards should be eliminated.
