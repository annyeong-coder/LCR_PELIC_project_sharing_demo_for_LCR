The worst meal experience I have ever had happened in LuLu restaurant. Last August my parents came to Pittsburgh. Almost time we had meals at home because my parents are vegetarian. It was difficult to find a vegetarian restaurant especially they like Chinese food. Some friends told me that LuLu is the best restaurant in Pittsburgh and there are some vegetable menus. I forgot to make reservation before we got there. We waited for thirty minutes and my father was hungry and angry. I ordered one Hawaii fried rice and one kimchi fried rice for my parents and I had fried rice noodles. The meals were terrible. Rice was hard spices were too much and tofu was not fresh. My rice noodles were too dry which let me have stomachache. We didn't finish our meals and we went home had instant noodles. After that day I haven't been LuLu again.
