Indent The Chinese New Year is very important to the Chinese. The date of the Chinese New Year is different every year because the date of the Chinese New Year is base on the lunar calendar. According to the lunar calendar the January 1st changes every year. We celebrate the Chinese New Year for whole 15 days and each day has different meaning for us. However the most important thing is the families need to get together in the Chinese New Year. I remember when I was a child I loved the Chinese New Year a lot. Because during the Chinese New Year I could visit relatives with my families. We also could travel everywhere we wanted in this vocation. The most exciting thing for children is we only allow playing fireworks in the Chinese New Year. We usually bought many fireworks from the grocery and played fireworks with my cousins in a park near our home. I enjoyed the time played with them because it's hard for us to meet each other in our daily life. I miss my childhood a lot. After 2 weeks the Chinese New Year is coming. It's a pity that I can't get together with my family because I'm in the U. S. But I will call my families and greet with them. Hope all of us can have a wonderful and perfect new year.
