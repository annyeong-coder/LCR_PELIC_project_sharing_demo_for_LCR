I met my husband when we entered a same college at the same time. We were playing volleyball in a same team while we were studying in the collage. I didn't know about him well at first but 3 years after our enrollment I was paired with him in a project for 6 months. We talked about so many things while we were meeting. Strangely I was very happy while I talk with him although there were many differences between us. I thought he was a reticent person while I played volleyball together whereas he talked very much to me about his childhood hobbies favorite things and his philosophy of life while we were doing exercises together. When we ended the project we were living together. Few years later we get married when I started practice at a hospital that is 200 miles away from our hometown.
