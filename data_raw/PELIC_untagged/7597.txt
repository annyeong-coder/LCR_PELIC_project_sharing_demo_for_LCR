Living future Advanced medical just one pill New technology in the kitchen more comfortable and perfect than dish washer I'd like to live future time because it would be fantastic. There are some reasons for my choices. First of all we can make advanced medical technology in the future. Lots of people who are suffer from cancer now they might not die because of just one pill without any tough operation in future time. Current many doctors and scientists research and study about medical technology. And another reason I thought is new technology in the kitchen. Many wives who live this period should do many kinds housework by them selves although there are comfortable machines. Because they are not nearly as much helpful as wives hands. In my case I always have trouble with dish washer. It doesn't work clean as my hands and what is worse I should pay expensive electric charge when I use that machine. In the future maybe I can do kitchen works with machine's helping. So I'd like to live in the future period.
