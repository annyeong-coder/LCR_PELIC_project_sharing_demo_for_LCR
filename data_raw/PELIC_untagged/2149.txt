I am going to introduce myself. I'm ANON_NAME_0 but some of my friends call me Jimi. I am studying English since last year. I want to improve my English skills because I interest another country culture. I think language important to learn culture. My hobby is watch movies and listen music. When I am watching movie I am always eating popcorn. I want to be international businessman. So I am always trying to learn culture and history.
