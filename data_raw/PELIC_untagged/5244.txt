This is the advice that I would give a new ELI student. First of all you have to attend class everyday and submit homework on time. Second you should meet English speakers and talk to them because using English is the best way to learn English. Third Take care of your health because living in the U. S. A. Is hard to you something to eat and missing your family. So you should take care of your health. Finally you should meet many different country people. If you meet many different country people you will learn various different country cultures.
