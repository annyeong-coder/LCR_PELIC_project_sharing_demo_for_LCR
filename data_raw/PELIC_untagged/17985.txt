Culture shock is a problem for people who travel and the best way to solve it is studying the culture in the other countries. First we can study the cultures by reading books about cultures. Moreover we can learn the culture from visiting a good place. Finally we can study the culture by making a good friend who is a foreigner. I think studying the culture is better than not studying it.
