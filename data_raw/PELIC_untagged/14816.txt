Foreign movies a good way to learn about a different country or culture . In my opinion that foreign movies a nice way to learn about different country different customs and traditions. For example I never have been in India and I didn't know nothing about Indian's culture. But two years ago my friend gave me CD with Indian film Black Angel this movie about love story. I saw that and I was interesting about this film because it illustrated Indian wedding customs it is distinct from Russian's wedding customs and traditions. This example demonstrate that we can seeing foreign movies and get something interesting about foreign countries.
