Before I came to Pittsburgh many friends recommended visiting Falling Water. I went to Falling Water last June where there is a green building that protects the environment. I was interested in for how much money I could have this building. Then I wanted to go to night clubs. In Taiwan my parents didn't let me go to night clubs. Until now I haven't been there because I haven't been able to find someone to go with me. And I wanted to go for a drive by myself in America. I can drive but I am afraid to drive in Pittsburgh. There are too many Stop signs and people drive too fast. The most important thing is that I am afraid of getting lost. However I have driven my brother to school three times. I wish I could drive to travel by myself before I leave America.
