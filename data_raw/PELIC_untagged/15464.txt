When I was living in Korea I wanted to see the movie Shindler's List I did not. However a few months ago I found this at the library in which is located Shaller Township. This movie playing in Korea is one of the most popular movies. Shindler's List directed by Steven Spielberg is critical and commercial success. Shindler's List with which was produced Steven Spielberg Gerald. R Mallen and Branco Ruthtihi won a prize of Academy Award in 1993. This movie which has historical background makes people think about life. Many people especially Jewish lost their life at a period of Adolf Hitler. The director referred to the matter life of Jewish at that time in this movie. Oscar Schindler a businessman gave refuges to the Jewish that has lived in Poland for the period of Adolf Hitler. This movie was dramatized an unaccountable heroic act of Oscar Schindler.
