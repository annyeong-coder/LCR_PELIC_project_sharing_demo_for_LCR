One of events which I wish it had not happened had tortured me. During preparing the exam for university I and my ex girlfriend were always at odds about little things. My intuition warned me there were reason but I ignored it. I simply thought that was just her capricious because we had been made serious relationship for a year. When we argued I didn't realize that how much she got stress because of the examination for entrance to university because this was second chance to enter the university for her. Had I known she got stress so much I would have done something for her. She was independent otherwise I would realize that. After all when we broke up I just said that I am tired of you. If I didn't harsh to her we could have good relationship
