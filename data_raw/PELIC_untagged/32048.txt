Nowadays media has strong impacts on people lives and values unfortunately media is paying to much attention to celebrities' personal life which of course something wrong. The reasons why I disagree with this issue are first that the persons are usually affected by the things they see everyday and everywhere in media so the media should be careful what to show because it has direct effect on society. For example celebrities sometimes do violent or bad things in public like drinking too much or driving too fast the next day everyone know what he did in magazines and news channels as he is considered as model by his fans most of whom will think that he is doing the right cool thing. Second media should respect personal life these celebrities are normal people and they have the right to be respected posting their pictures and stories everywhere is absolutely violate their life. I remember one time I read in the news paper the journalist were running after Queen Ranyia the queen of Jordan just to take a picture of her with her son when they where spending a vacation outside their country
