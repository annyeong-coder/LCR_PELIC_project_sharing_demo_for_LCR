Achieving my goals in life is undoubtedly a source of happiness and this is certainly true for some people. When a man achieves a goal he feels that his efforts are being rewarded with success which results in real happiness. Obtaining an MA or PhD degree buying a new house or having a good job are all examples of accomplishments that make people happy. Among the goals I have achieved so far the ones that make me the happiest are those that make my family feel proud of me. Enjoying a healthy body I believe can give a great deal of happiness to those who appreciate it. When a person gets sick he loses the full taste of happiness even if that person has other good reasons to feel happy. As the human body suffers physical pain it becomes hard to enjoy other things along with that pain. A toothache can simply take away happiness from any person however strong. On a larger scale chronic health problems can deprive a person from enjoying happiness as long as those problems persist. Enjoying physical and mental health is enough for a person to be overwhelmed by happiness. Reaching a level of contentment and satisfaction is necessary for happiness to be attainable. This feeling of extreme satisfaction is stimulated differently for every person. As for me achieving an important goal making others happy and being healthy can all drive real happiness into my heart. Although a person's life is full of ups and downs a wise person should know how to keep his her spirits up and stay content and happy at all times.
