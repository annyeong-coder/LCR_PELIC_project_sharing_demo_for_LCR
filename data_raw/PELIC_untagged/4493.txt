My first name is associated with my mother's name. One chinese character is same as hers. The character's mean is wealth in which included mind and supplies. My hobbies are travering abroad and playing golf. I have just a little time to travel but at least I have a long trip once a year. I'm planning to trip to the Grand Canyon and Yosemite in this summer vacation. I play golf twice or three times a week. I do it with my husband or with my friends. Compared with Japan playng it here is inexpensive. So I can enjoy it so much.
