With whom should I spend the rest of my life a question has not been solved for many people. When I asked my father's help to collect myself and answer this question Son more hast less speed. Take your time and look inside yourself then around you. Do not make any decision on rush and remember that not everything glitters is gold because crying after making the wrong decision will not help you. After that I've done what my father has taught me and I've come up with some examples. I would like to share the rest of life with a woman who is honest and cares about the family. Also the woman whom I want to choose should have a sense of humor open minded and smart. I'm a person who likes to eat and relax sometime therefore she should know how to cook and not being annoying all the time. Finally I'm also a person whose energy is always active so she should be a dynamic person. All these criteria that I've come up are the most important. However I believe that in order to have a happy life I should give to get what I want.
