I have been most influenced by my husband. I was taught by him to keep having a positive thinking and doing something to progress even if I am in trouble. I am still inspired by him especially be the way he loves people with no reason. He is suppotive friendly and sociable. They were things which I don't have. He is a baby child and he was brought up with lots of love by not only his parenats and his 3 siblings who are 20 year older than him but also his relatives and neighbors. Therefore he can love any people without having doubts. I used to be a person who was untrust people who came to me close. I believe that I was raised with lots of love of my parents but I couldn't help being cautious to make friends and be frienly to them. His influence can be seen in me of present. We have been knowen each other for more than 15 years so I was helped by him to solve a problem in my life anytime. Even if I pretend that I am depressed he always realizes something happens to me. My mind is always read by him. It's sometimes annoying but I think that it is a wife and husband.
