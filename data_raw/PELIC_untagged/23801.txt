If I had studied hard when I was a high school student I would have gone to the school which I wanted to go. However my grade in a high school was not good so I had to go a university about which I was not satisfied. If I had continued to go that university I would have graduated from the university 3 years ago and gotten a job in the major of the engineering. I decided to transfer a university. Had I not transfer a university I would not have come to university because I have been interested in learning English since then. After transferring a university I planned to come to the United States. If I had not come to the United States I would not need to do this homework now.
