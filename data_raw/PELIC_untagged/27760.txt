One day I called my friend to buy her wedding dress but she didn't answer. I left her a voice message to call me back. When she called me back she told me that she just woke up. We went over her wedding ceremony and we found out that we forgot to buy her wedding cake. We decided that I pick her up and buy everything left. She told me that she was very tired but I told her to keep on her hard work.
