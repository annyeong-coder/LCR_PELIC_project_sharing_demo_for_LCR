I have never buy lotteries because in my perspective that winning the lottery is very hard to happen. But it does not mean that it is impossible. I would be very happy if I win the lottery. Winning the lottery would have three important effects on my life. First I will buy everything which I want. My family is not rich so I had to think carefully before I bought something. For example when I bought my first motorcycle I had to collect money for 6 months. If I won the lottery I can buy it suddenly. Although I want something is more expensive than motorcycle. Second I will travel to anywhere which is my ambition. I love traveling but it may be difficult if I do not have much money. As a result of winning the lottery it will be easy to travel. It is not necessary to worry about my budget I just worry about where I should go first. Finally I will establish the foundation for help poor people who can not help themselves. In my country there are many people who do not have opportunity to get something good for their life. For instance poor people can not give education for their children because they do not have enough income and their children have to leave from school to help their family. As a consequence of winning the lottery I would be one of the happiest people in the world.
