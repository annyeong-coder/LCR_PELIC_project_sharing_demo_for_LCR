I've been making this site for a while and I'm almost done. I've been made this page to introduce myself. I've been learning photography several years ago. I've leaned how to use manual cameras and the way of developing black and white film. Recently I bought new digital camera so I've been making album with my photos. I've been trying to get the prize from photography competition many times but I couldn't. I've sent my photography to another competition last month. And I like to play basketball. But after moved to Pittsburgh I haven't been playing lately. When I was in Korea I played basketball so many times with my team. Watching American TV shows is my favorite thing to do here. I've been watching Prison Break Lost Heroes and CSI . I watched Friends when I was in Korea. I loved it.
