I think that the economic affect the tourism by two ways. One on them is when the economic of any country is growing up I think it will grow up the tourism too. We can see in the chart that the prediction in 2020 is putting china in the first class because they accept that the arrivals is about 137. 1 And the second way that is accept the arrival in the united states is the second after china. Also I believe that the annual income for the people are affect the tourism a lot because if there is no enough income there will nobody traveling all over the world. Furthermore the terrorism affect's the tourism because if people would travel for pleasure and joy they would want to be safe. I think It's true that the economic and terrorism affect tourism in the world.
