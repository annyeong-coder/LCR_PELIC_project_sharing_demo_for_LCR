According to the World Wildlife Fund WWF it said that we focus special attention on our flagship species giant pandas tigers polar bears endangered whales and dolphins rhinos elephants marine turtles and great apes. In order to protect those animals two approaches are more effective and practical. The first approach to save endangered species is to save an area of nature as much as you can. The human being has coexisted with animals since the human being was born in the earth but the human being has being ignored the nature where giant pandas tigers rhinos elephants and great apes live for the sake of more convenient our lives such as constructing many roads bridges and railroads. Many woods in mountains were cut because of golf resorts and huge areas of the nature are used as a farm to product vegetables. However we should use the areas not horizontally but vertically. This method can save mountains and forests. The second approach is to reduce garbage. Especially artificial garbage such as plastic bags aluminum cans and batteries produce air environmental and water pollutions when they are disposed. The garbage disposals directly threaten the lives of polar bears whales dolphins and marine turtles. When you go shopping you use your own bags for shopping not plastic bags of shops or stores as much as you can. Therefore the two methods we can practice now are to save nature and to reduce garbage.
