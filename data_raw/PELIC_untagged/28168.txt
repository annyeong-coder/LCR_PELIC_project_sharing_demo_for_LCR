German proverb said Friendship is a plant which we must often water . I total agree this opinion. People are emotion animal all of feeling that come from understand each other and relate to life for a long time. In my thinking if we don't establish contact our friends very often maybe we will miss our friendship easily. I want to talk about the example by myself. I had two roommates when I was studying college. One of them who is my classmate's friend we didn't have the same class together. But we ate dinner together every day. After we graduated from college we still establish contact very often. We like talk about job family and emotion that we have problems. Even we didn't meet each other very often. Friendship likes plant that need water makes it grow up. So I think people who need to cultivate friends often to keep friendship.
