Michelle May 23 08 My favorite place to eat lunch in Pittsburgh is Taiwan Coffee which is locating on Forbes Avenue. There are the following reasons First it just takes 5 mines to walk to there so that I can take my time instead of being rush. Second during the lunch time they have a special meal which is cheaper than others. Only 5 you can get a set that contain the meat rice and vegetable. The size is toot big that I couldn't finish it by myself so I always share a set with my friend. Third due to the owner is also come from Taiwan and it seems more familiar and friendly for me. In a word I would like to have lunch in a convenient place that would not too far and the price is also acceptable. I think Taiwan Coffee is my best choice.
