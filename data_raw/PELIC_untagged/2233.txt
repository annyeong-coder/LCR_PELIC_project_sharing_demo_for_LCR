Good luck has very something to do with success. For example for the sportsman success means win the game or get the highest score in the competition. In this case it could have so many different situation. It's not the determined by himself. It's just given to them. In this condition these differences could be helpful to him or not. Only GOD knows. Additionally when I was middle in the test before I couldn't remember the correct answer but I could guess at least. But my guess turns out correct answer finally. At that time good luck helped me. It was not my answer. It could happen something in the world you can't believe. So good luck is essential part of success.
