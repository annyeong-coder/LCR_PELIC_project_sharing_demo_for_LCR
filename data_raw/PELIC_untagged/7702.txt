I'm from Thailand which is located in South East Asia and bordered by Burma Lao and Cambodia. My country is composed of 76 provinces. Moreover it's divided into 6 regions North South East West Center and North East. The most important person in my country is the king Bhumibol Adulyadej. He is regarded as the world's longest serving current head of state and the longest serving monarch in Thai history. Bhumibol is considered to be the most respected person in Thailand because of his personality and his works. Also it is claimed that he is the best one who influences Thai people. Those are because he ameliorated the conditions of poverty almost entire of Thailand. Moreover he paved the way for sanitation and resolved controversies in Thailand many times. For these reason it is said that he is the center of Thai people and it is assumed that he might still be the Thai king at least 10 years even though his age is eighty.
