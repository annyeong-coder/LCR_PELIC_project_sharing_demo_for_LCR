Undoubtfully sports are crucial entertainment activity to people. Also sports have significant meaning for people because there are unpredictable life moments. Watching the moment and being in the place of a grand slam a touchdown and a buzzer bitter are a reason of sports. Wearing favorite team's t shirt and watching their games have people share life and fellowship in middle of routine life. A single sport game gives very similar feeling of a life moment. If their favorite team wins at final people cheer together and if the team loses go home sadly. Sports have become an exit from their tough job and chores. Especially in American society sports are big part of their culture. Wherever I go the cities in the U. S. There are sports stadiums and people who wear the sport team's logo. For example when I was traveling Boston I went to Fenway Park home of redsox. Often redsox games' tickets are sold out because for Boston citizens being in Fenway Park is one of their lives. I could feel their passion and love toward redsox easily. Even my friend who did not like baseball before started to like redsox. He was so excited to the game and crowds. Whenever he accesses to the internet he checks sports section first. So sports are not just a set of game. It is a life and passion to people.
