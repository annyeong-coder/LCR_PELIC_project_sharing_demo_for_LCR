Personal Letter March 20 2007 Dear Father Hi my father! How are you I'm very fine. I want to buy laptop for studying. I have compared between the Toshiba and the LG laptop for a week. The Toshiba laptop price is 1020 but the LG laptop price is 840. The Toshiba is more expensive than the LG. The Toshiba can put in more files than the LG because the Toshiba has 160 GB the LG only has 60GB. Both have the same memory. The Toshiba and LG are different in screen size. The Toshiba has a 14 inch and The LG has a 15 inch monitor. The Toshiba is easy to move anywhere because the Toshiba is smaller than the LG. The Toshiba CPU is Intel dual core 2 and the LG CPU is dual core so the Toshiba is faster than the LG. In my opinion the most important thing is CPU if someone wants to buy a laptop. It was difficult to choose between the Toshiba and the LG but I have decided to buy the Toshiba. I miss you. I want to go back to my country. You wait for me this December. Take care for your health. Good bye! Warmly Your son
