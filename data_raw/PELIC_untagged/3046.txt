To dear Mr. ANON_NAME_0 I'm a student at the EFL Computer Training Institute. I think this class has some problems. First this class doesn't have enough computer so you'd better to provide computer to our students. Secondly it's too dark to study. You ought to fix the lights. Thirdly The window is broken. This season is winter so you should fix the window. Fourthly you shouldn't allow to eat food in this classroom. Fifthly this classroom is too dirt so maybe you'd better clean there and ought to make more trashes. Lastly we need to use copymachine but it's out of order. So you should repair it.
