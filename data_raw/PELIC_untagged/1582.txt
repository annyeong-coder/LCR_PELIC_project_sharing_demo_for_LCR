Two important areas of my life are my family and my friends. I am the first child I in my family so if I had not been born my parents would have been unhappy about it. They wished a boy as first child. If they had not had me they could have lost any hope about a potential successor. I am very important to my friends and family in our association. They could not have gotten a drill machine for their potable water if I had not been born. They would not have done much success on their biannual competition if I had not been born.
