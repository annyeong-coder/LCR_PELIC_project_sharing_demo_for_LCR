In the morning I usually wake up at 8 o'clock. I take a shower and put on the clothes. Then I strighten up my bed and desk. When the bus shows up I rush to the busstop and get it on. After arriving at school I usuallly buy some bread and a cup of coffee for my breakfast. My classes are from 10 to 16 o'clock and I should keep on attending to every class. Before going to bed I call my mom and talk about my usual day. After hanging up the phone I turn off the light and go to bed.
