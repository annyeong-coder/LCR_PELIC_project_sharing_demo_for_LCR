Increasing of operating expenditures per student in the Fox Chapel Area School District must come to the attention of the resident of Fox Chapel. In 2001 in the FCASD operating expenditures were just about 9 600 dollars. From then on to 2005 operating expenditures were about 12 000 dollars. The increase in percentage is 20 percent. The increasing percentage on average every year was about 4. 46 Percent. This was a bigger increase. It shows that the management cost was increased. It indicates that the government continually raised the education outlay every year. It implies that the residents will pay more tax. This should lower the life quality of the residents in FCASD. The residents should supervise the principals of all school in FCASD to improve their ability and reduce unnecessary cost.
