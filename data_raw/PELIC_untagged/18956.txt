I usually RUN in the park early in the morning but today it IS RAINNING so I DON'T RUN. I AM PARTICIPATING in ELI classes. Unfortunately I'M NOT TAKING speaking class. I LIKE traveling aboard. But recently I DON'T TRAVEL because of busy. I GO to swim every weakend but this weekend I 'M NOT GOING swim. I usually COOK a light dinner but today I 'M COOKING a special dinner for my sister. After dinner I usually DO homework while I 'M LISENING radio. I usually TAKE a shower before I GO to bed.
