I think it would be interesting to have synesthesia. Because this condition can bring you up and you can get more senses to feel those words music and letter. If I have synesthesia I would think this world would be more colorful. When you listen to the music you can see music symbols dance in forth of your eyes. I think it will be very interest and wonderful experience. If you can taste the words it might be a good way for remember the words. For example when you read the word 'sugar' you can taste sweet. It is good way to remember what is 'sugar'. And when you read the story you have more feeling and get more interesting from the story if you can taste the words. Of course I don't have this kind of condition but I still think this world is really interesting. Although I cannot taste the words when I read the story I can discuss my feeling about this story with my friends. Although I cannot see the music while I listen to music I can share my feeling about this song with my friends. Therefore I think it is good if you have synesthesia then you can share more feeling with your friends. If not this is fine because I still can discuss my feeling with friends.
