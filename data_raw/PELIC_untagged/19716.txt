Finally the day that I was anticipating has come the day for the volunteer at soup kitchen. I woke up early on Saturday morning however I felt that it was a kind of dilemma whether I want to go to the soup kitchen that I have longed for or go back to sleep. I finally decided to wake up and get ready to go. The soup kitchen was held at a church on Centre Ave and Aiken. I ANON_NAME_0 and the other students helped prepare the tables desserts and plates etc. All the volunteers helped serving food to the people coming to have breakfast at the church. There was no disruption while we worked so I think it was an unqualified job for the day. Before I left the place I felt that the activity has sparked my wanting to come for the soup kitchen volunteer every Saturday. However I have to fight with the laziness I always have in the morning.
