Happiness is really important and necessary for people so everyone wants to be happy. There are so many ways to reach happiness and everyone has their own way. Achieving their goals or doing something worthy is a very general way. In my case spending time with my family learning something new and reaching goals make me happy. At first spending time with my family leads to me happiness. Family is the closest relationship from birth to death. They always support me in which I want to do and just the existence of them can cheer me up. Since I'm living alone and very lonely now I really miss my family. If I was with my family I could be glad more. For these reason this is my first and most important way to be happy. Second learning something new brings me intellectual satisfaction. I have been enjoying reading books from my childhood. Every time I realize something new through books I feel satisfaction and have the desire to read more books. It's the same with listening to lectures or classes. Learning and understanding whatever I didn't know before is very meaningful and worthy which makes me happy. Third reaching my goals will also result in my being happy. In my case I have wanted to be a teacher since I was 6 years old. I studied under many respectable teachers when I was a student. Since I have been deeply affected by them I have always wanted to be a teacher like the. As a result I'm majoring in Korean language education and preparing to be a teacher. I expect that being a teacher can lead me to a wonderful life. I hope to be happy all the time by being with my family learning something new and achieving what I've wanted in a lifetime. Everyone wants to be happy but it is not accomplished of itself. If efforts and endeavors have to be followed happiness will be achieved. In other words pursuing happiness can make your life more invaluable. Therefore I will try to learn new things more and spend time more worthily. Those who do his or her best can gain happiness.
