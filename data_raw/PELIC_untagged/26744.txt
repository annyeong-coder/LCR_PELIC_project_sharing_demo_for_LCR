I used to live in Saudi Arabia. I graduated form English college in Qassim University. I taught english language to high school in Burydah. I like to learn about people how to learn language. I read and studied some courses in second language acquisition in college. Today I am staying in America to learn English language and practice it. I am trying to speak up as possible as I can to improve my language. In past I used to live in my father home and it was big building. I drove my great landcruser to my work. My mother cooked my lunch. And there was someone wash my clothes. Today I am doing everything by myself. I am living in an old and small building. I am walking to university. And I am cooking and washing my clothes. Obviously you can see the difference between past and future. Finally I am living in Pittsburgh these days and attending University of Pittsburgh. I am acquiring English language. I am spending my time reading and writing in diary. I am enjoy my staying in Pittsburgh.
