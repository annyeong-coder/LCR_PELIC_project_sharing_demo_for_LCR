There is seven days in a week. Starting from Monday and ending with Sunday. Those days are semi equal in their meaning to people. However many people believe that Friday and Sunday are singtifigent days because Friday is the starting day of the weekend and Sunday is the ending point. So many people have different feelings about both of those days. First Friday is a crucial day to people because in that day they are planning to have and enjoy all the day especially after a long working week. Therefore people feel happy and excited about it especially if they anticiped all the week. For example many of the workers escape from work as soon as the clock show the end of the day work. However this is not the case when it is Sunday. Many feel tired and sad in this day. Moreover they know that tomorrow will be the start day of the working week where they will have to work all week just to reach the weekend to relax and enjoy their time. Second Friday usually includes having fun and forget about anything related to work. While Sunday is about doing all the work and catch up with what they have missed or not do in Friday. So a typical Friday can be described as pure excitement and joy. On the other hand Sunday can be described as the dark day because people will spend their time in their home or in offices just to do work until the sun goes down. Finally the similarity between those days is that they shear a weekend and a week. But the differences is that how people feel about those days. So happy sad mad and joy are some of the feelings that people have in those days.
