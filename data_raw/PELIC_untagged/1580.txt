Two important areas of my life are my family and friends. I am an only child so if I hadn't been born my family's life wuold have been bore. Specially my aunt. My aunt and I have very good relationship she wanted a daughter very much. If she hadn't had me she might have a unhappy life. If my friends hadn't had me they would have been sad. I am a good and happy friend. So if they hadn't had me their lif might have had less fun. . . . . EW
