I watched a movie yesterday night which name is Paranormal Activities. It was a scary movie that was expected to scare the people who watched. I got frightened for a few scenes but not that much. The movie was about one couple and the house which are living in together. The girl whose girl friend of the guy tells the doctor about the unidentified thing she was seeing and feeling. Then they start to record every single moment they spend in this house. When the midnight comes and they go to bed something that we can not see comes to bedroom and take the cover on her. The unidentified object slam the door and make some weird noises. They see the things that was happened the night before on the camera record next day. Later than they keep recording like this for nealy one month. At first the girl who is frightened by these kinda things wants to leave the house but the guy doesn't want and try to understand what's happening. Later than the guy whom she love very much wants to leave house but the girl doesn't want. She made a plan with the object to kill him unconsciously and unintentionally . Later than one night the girl kills him. And the movie ends.
