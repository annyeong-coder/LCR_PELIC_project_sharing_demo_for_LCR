Accident I still felt upset when I reminded of one serious traffic accident occurred on March 3 2006. At that moment I was planning to cross the street to take No. 10 Bus to come back home. It was rush hour so this bus stop station was already filled with people and one No. 10 Bus was being driven towards them suddenly an unpredictable thing happened contrary of being stopped this bus seemed to be control by a ghost to rush into the station. It was so abrupt that those people lining ahead had no time to escape at all. The bus was eventually stopped after it went several miles and the driver was confined to his chair due to fear. The police arrived soon the driver was arrested and injured people were taken to the nearest hospital. I was shocked by this horrible accident. How could it have happened Next day the newspaper reported the culprit was a driver who had little experience and he had already continued to work for 15 hours before the accident occurred which made him to press the accelerator instead of the brake when he attempted to stop the bus. Total 4 persons were killed in this accident two of them were one mother and daughter and ten persons were injured in varied degree. The young driver has been charged for life imprisonment but four vivid lives have been lost forever. It is a painful and bloody lesson most importantly something must be performed to prevent tragedy like it.
