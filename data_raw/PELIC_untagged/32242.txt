Koky 3G 3 12 2021 The reasons for being late to class There are many reasons for being late to class. A lot of students have problem with transportations. For instance who use buss system should be careful with time. Likewise who have their own cars have problem with traffics so they should wake up early to avoid the traffic. Indeed if the students be in the traffic they will be late to class. Some students have problem with sleeping. For example some students do not sleep early specially after weekends. In addition some students do not have someone to wake them up to class. Some students have more than one task. For instance some students have class in TOEFL and ELI so that will makes the student exhaust and they will not be capable to attend their class on time. Some of the students are not aware of the significant of classes. For example some students spend a lot of time smoking cigarettes during leisure time. Furthermore some students spend a lot of time speaking or chatting with their friends. All in all being late to class has a lot of advantages. I hope you like it
