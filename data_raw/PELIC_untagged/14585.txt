One day when I was in a shop in Hong ANON_NAME_0 an old man who is Cantonese was trying to wear a jacket. He did not know that he dropped 20 Hong ANON_NAME_0 dollar bill from his pocket though I could see him dropped the bill. However I could not tell him because I could not speak in Cantonese at that time. After he got out of the shop without buying anything a couple of young boy and young girl found it and picked it out and then bought something with his money. I should have told the old man as soon as I found it or I ought not to have ignored him. I think he might have used the 20 dollar bill for buying the jacket and wonder that they could have asked the staff of the shop about his money if the couple had been honest. That is people ought to have been careful for their belongings anytime and should not have used someone's own money for the sake of their greed for money.
