In 1997 I HAD GRADUATED from high school. By 1997 I HAD BEEN STUDYING English for six years. English is my favorite subject. I really wanted to go to American to study English however I didn't have enough money at that time. When I was in the high school I HAD TRAVELED to Thailand Malaysia and Japan but I HAD NOT BEEN to America. Now I'm studying in the ELI in America I deeply appreciate it.
