Hi Sand I feel sorry for you and my advice for you is You should've tell him that you love him so he might have stayed with you rather than preferring to go for his job. You should've ask him to stay with you just to find out if he loves you or no and that shows you love him and you need him. You ought not to quit you job unless you make sure he loves you. You mentioned that you're not happy without him so you ought to visit him and if he loves you he'll ask you to move there. Otherwise you shouldn't quit your job because you might lose you job and later you discover that he doesn't love you. If You discover that he doesn't love you shouldn't let that brings you down because you'll find someone else who will love you. Hope my advice helps you. Good luck Sand.
