My favorite place by study is in the Hillman library in the first floor because first it has computers that are located in front of desk where I am working I always study in a desk located in the center of room. In back are located the bathroom and the right is the cafeteria to the right of the cafeteria is of Start Media room it is a place where I can to see movie and practicing my listening. On both sides of my desk is the bookshelf back it is the door of out side and at the end of room is the projection screen and finally the light is very good.
