Ten years ago when I went to Riyadh where my grandparents live I saw many things. I remember my grandparents' house which was very big its color was brown. I also remember the city which is the capital of Saudi Arabia was very crowded. It has many buildings. I saw Almamlakah tower which is the tallest one in Saudi Arabia. It was very beautiful. I visited the governance's palace in which the citizens can meet the king of the country. The roads which built for the cars were very spacious. I liked Riyadh so much.
