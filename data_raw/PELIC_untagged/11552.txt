Seoul where I was born is my important place. I lived with my grandparents and my parents who I loved. And it was the only time I had a bicycle that I gave it to my sister when she was born. I like this place because my grandfather whom I followed much had spent much time with me and taught me many things. And also it was the first place where I started learning piano. At then I was the pianist whom I dreamed of. This house had two floors and the basement. An upper store where I played hide and seek with my sister was my secret room. It was so fun when I played with my sister in that house where my childhood had been spent. My sister who I had to take care of was so little to find me. After few years my grandfather whose house we lived decided to move to other city Kyung ki Do. So we moved out. Before then it was my happiest days that I had.
