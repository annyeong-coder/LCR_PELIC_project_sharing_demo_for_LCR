There are 7 person in my family including me. My Mom is 59 years old and she enjoys working in the house. My father is 64 years old and he likes to travel a lot. I have four sisters. I am younger than three of them and older than one of them. I love dancing and I like to cook as well. I usually work at Teva Lab but now I am taking an English Course. I am learning a lot with my teacher and I hope to improve my english. I am living alone in an apartment and sometimes I feel sad because I miss staying with my family and my friends.
