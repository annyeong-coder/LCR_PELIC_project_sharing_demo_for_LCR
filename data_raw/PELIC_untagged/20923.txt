There are many things I had never done before coming to Pittsburgh. First I have never seen a polar bear before since we do not have polar bears in Georgia Zoo. I liked Pittsburgh Zoo very much because it differs from the Zoo of my country. Also I had never seen this type of shopping centers because in my country we have a large building with different brand stores and here there is a large space and every store has its own building in Pittsburgh shopping centers. I think shopping centers in Pittsburgh are better for easy shopping but our shopping center is more comfortable if you do not have a car. In addition I had never tasted Mexican food before. I had visited a Chinese restaurant almost twice a month before I came here that is why Chinese food was not an innovation for me. But I really liked Mexican food which is not so popular in my country. Finally I had never seen so many fast food restaurants together. I cannot say that I like fast food because I think that it harms our health.
