Nowadays we are living in many TV commercials. But I hate TV commercials cause several thing. First I think that TV commercials have a bad influence as sexist and racist commercials. Sometimes they bring out crime. Next there are too many non efficiency TV commercials for just make a commercial benefit. It is felt boring and annoying mind to me. Finally there are some exaggerated commercials. I think this is the most important problem. Originally TV commercials should have a true tip communication. As this result I don't like TV commercials.
