I have been living my room which is dormitory of Pitt for 2 moths. This room which is tiny is rectangular. I have a desk which has drawers and a wardrobe which has 4 small drawers and 1 big drawer. There is also a bed which is so high that I can put my suitcase under in my room. My bed is near the window which is small and I can see 5th avenue though. The wardrobe on which I put foods is opposite to the bed. I also hang my favorite pictures on the wall which is next to wardrobe. I also paste post its which I wrote down important English sentences on my desk.
