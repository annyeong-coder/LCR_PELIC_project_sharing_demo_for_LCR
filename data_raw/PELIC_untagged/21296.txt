I'm a guy who lives away from his hometown. My home town is Riyadh which is located in the central part of Saudi Arabia. It is the capital of Saudi Arabia. Riyadh has many factories such as petrochemical factories and oil refineries. For instance SAC which is considered as the largest factory in Riyadh is petrochemical factory whereas SEI is the second largest factory which is classified one of the oil refineries. Alrwuddah where I grew up is a section of Riyadh. I have many friends most of whom live there. I remember a time when I was student in high school there was only two malls in my neighborhood however now there are more than 20 malls. Indeed Riyadh is considered as the largest city in my country. It has about four million citizens according to statistic in 2008. Nowadays Riyadh is growing up dramatically because there is an increase in its economy. Traditionally Saudi Arabia's economy has been reliant on oil. Within the past 15 years however its economy has diversified.
