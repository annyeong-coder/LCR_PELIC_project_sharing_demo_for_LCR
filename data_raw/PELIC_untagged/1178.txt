When I was a high school student I faced dilemma several times. One day despite severe headache I had to go to school for a big test. My mother wanted me to stay home. I also did but I went to school. The exam was terrible and I should have studied more. I almost couldn't pass the exam. Luckily I had one more chance to take it. If I didn't pass it I could have stayed same year again and I couldn't have go to the college in 2002. If I stayed home I might not have taken an exam. Though this dilemma I was grown up.
