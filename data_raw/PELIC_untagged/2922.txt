The mountain is like the giant who always stands on the ground. It is so huge that it's hard for people to get familiar with it. The peak of the mountain is like the head of the giant it is always covered by the fog that no one can see his face clearly. The green is the color of his skin because he always stands there no matter it's sunny or rainy it makes his skin looks like very rough. Grasses on the top of the mountain are like his clothes it's fit for him. And the giant wears a deep green pants because trees there are so emerald. The roads in the mountain are like the ropes which are the tool for him to hunting. Some small houses in the mountain are like the decorations on his clothes because they are so special and unique.
