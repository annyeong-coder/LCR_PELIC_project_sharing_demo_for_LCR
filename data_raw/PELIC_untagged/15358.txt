I was a product supervisor in a large computer company ten years ago and I was working along with two best colleagues. Their names are ANON_NAME_0 an ANON_NAME_1. My boss asked me to recommend one of them to be a manager of an accounting department. Soon after that I started to analyze the differences and similarities between them. Then I decided to recommend ANON_NAME_1. They have several similarities that couldn't differentiate between them. First of all both have master's degree in an accounting. ANON_NAME_1 has the same punctuality of ANON_NAME_0. In addition ANON_NAME_0 is as responsible as ANON_NAME_1. I made the decision after I looked at the differences. While ANON_NAME_1 has 12 year experience ANON_NAME_0 has 6 years experience. Also ANON_NAME_1 is good at communication but ANON_NAME_0 is not. ANON_NAME_1 is organized and hard worker. In contrast ANON_NAME_0 is less organized. To sum up after I evaluate this differences and similarities I had a right decision. I chose ANON_NAME_1 to be an accounting manager and I sent a report to my boss. Finally ANON_NAME_1 deserved it because of his skills and high responsibility.
