I didn't anticipate that my friend Mary's blood pressure went up again the day before my long weekend. She wanted me to go to her restaurant to do her work on Saturday because I'm the only one who knows how to access her computer. I felt that I had a difficult dilemma I promised Mary to help her whenever she needs. On the other hand I told my cousin to visit and stay with her for the weekend. Finally I decided to help Mary because of her fragile health. I went to her restaurant very early on Saturday morning and did the packing and managing work till 7 30p. M. I was supposed to leave at 8 00 p. M. She said she would come to do the cumulative data of the accounting part for the day. She called and told me that she couldn't come to do the last part work of the day at 7 30p. M. I asked many questions about the work however she was too weak to tell me step by step. Instead she gave me many ambiguous answers. I felt scared because I'm unqualified to do the accounting part. I was lucky that I got help from a friend and figured out how to do the last part of the work. I really appreciate her help. I couldn't thrive on too much pressure. I spent other two days of my long weekend resting at home.
