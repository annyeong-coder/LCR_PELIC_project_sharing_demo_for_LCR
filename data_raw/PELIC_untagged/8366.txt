In Japan the most important environmental issue is global warming. The advance of global warming affects environment greatly all over the world. In Japan the government took measures to deal with the problem and many schools or companies have followed the rule. For example when we go to a supermarket a cashier usually gives us the minimum number of plastic bags. In some stores we have to pay extra money if we need any bags. Moreover in many universities or companies we usually use stairs instead of elevators within two floors. We have another rule about an air conditioning. Even though it is really hot the air conditioning in public space is set for 82. 4F. A couple years ago the former prime minister proposed businessmen wear only shirts instead of wearing formal suits in summer. Since then many businessmen tend to wear casual shirt and try not to turn on an air conditioning. Even though each person has only a small effect on stopping global warming we make efforts as much as we can by following the rules suggested by the government.
