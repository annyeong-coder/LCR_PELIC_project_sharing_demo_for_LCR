It is one of my valuable achievements to get a teacher's certificate. When I decided to be a science teacher in 2004 I had been working at a company for 3 years. Until that time I had never thought about being a teacher. However while I was working the company I had been become skeptical about my job and future as a salaried man. In Korea in many cases it is somewhat stressful to live as a salaried man because their job securities are so unstable that many workers are worried about being fired even they are under age 40. For that reason I had prepared to enter the graduate school of education in order to get a teacher's certificate. After entering the graduate school of education I had been working at company in the morning and afternoon and attending the school in the evening. It was not easy to combine work and study. To make matters worse my company had introduced of new database system so I had overworked for a few months. I had considered giving up studying for several times but I hadn't. When only the last semester remained I got married on this January and quit the job in order to come to the U. S. With my husband. However just after one month since we got married I had to go back to the Korea to attend the last semester of my school. Therefore before I came to the U. S. Again on this August I had been being separated from my husband for 6 months. Finally I had graduated the graduate school on August and got the teacher's certificate.
