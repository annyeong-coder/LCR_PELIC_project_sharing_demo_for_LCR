Veranda Resort And Spa Veranda Resort And Spa is a nice place to visit. Veranda Resort And Spa is located in the East part of Thailand. It is a great place for the people who want to release their tension. It takes 2 3 hours from the capital city. The best room of this resort is quite expensive. It costs 500 600 per one night. The Spa here is very famous and popular. The last time I tried I really felt relax. Next to the resort the second relaxation spot in this resort is the beach. The white sand and the blue green sea water appeal everyone to go back there again and again. Moreover There are many interest places near the resort such as good seafood restaurants ATV cars for adventure Theater and etc. If I have a chance to go there again. That will probably my excellent holiday.
