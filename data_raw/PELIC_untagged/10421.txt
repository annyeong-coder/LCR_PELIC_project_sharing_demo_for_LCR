My house is comfortable. Sometimes I look it over before I go out to the school or other places. My house consists of a living room kitchen and bedroom bathroom. Even though my house is located on the first floor it never let me down all the time. On the contrary the location fills an atmosphere out better so I want to come back quickly when I go away from my house. However my house has a few disadvantages which is a shade house since a building stands up in front of my house. Occasionally it is difficult to get up early by reason of the problem. However I can have a good sleep day by day. Moreover I have clear feeling every morning because a lot of trees around the house think fresh air over. Also to sustain a good living environment I always make an endeavor to straighten up my house. I'm going to keep on living here until I go out other places.
