Feb 8 2009 Teresa Write about a project you are currently involved in such as learning English I have been learning English since elementary school. But my English teachers they didn't speak English in class. They only taught me the forms and the rules of making sentences in English. So I can't speak English very well on the other hand I have not had a chance to talk to someone. So I stared to take outside speaking classes to improve my speaking the teacher came from Canada she has made lots of activities to make us speak. Everyone in class wasn't afraid to speak English anymore we have had a great opportunity to speak for three months.
