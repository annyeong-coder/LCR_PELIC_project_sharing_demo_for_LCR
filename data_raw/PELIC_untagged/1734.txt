Evaluation of the assignment The final Writing Assignment of Chapter 3 The high international oil prices had as purpose to explain the reasons why the actual international oil prices are very high. The thesis statement that I gave in the essay was good and was developed during the text with support evidence details and with overall organization. In the assignment I used good support evidence and details that showed why the actual international high oil prices are the result of elevated demand of petroleum in industrialized countries and restricted supply in countries that produce this product. For instance I wrote that United States China and India are countries that are raising the demand of oil.
