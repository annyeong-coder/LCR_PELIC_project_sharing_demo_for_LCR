I had gotten my visa before I left my country. First of all I'd applied for an I 20 and the University of Pittsburgh sent the I 20 to me. From that I'd been preparing for getting my visa. I got enough evidence to proof my process in university relatives in Korea property etc. And took an interview at the embassy. I'd been looking forward to receiving my visa and finally I could obtain it a week later. Now I'm living and studying in Pittsburgh with safety because of my visa.
