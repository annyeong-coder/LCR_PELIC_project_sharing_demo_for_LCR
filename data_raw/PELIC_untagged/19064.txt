My teacher made me learn playing chess when I was a graduate student. Because he was a very good chess player. He thought that I could become a good player too. He helped me to learn a lot of things about chess. In his spare time he played chess with me. He got me to participate in different tournements. He didn t let me ignore the chess. Actually I didn t really want to become a professional chess player. I didn t like that he made me play chess all the time. However after I graduated from the high school I decided to give up playing chess. Because I thought that I wasn t very good at this. After I finished the high school we didn t meet each other. Sometimes I miss him and making me play chess.
