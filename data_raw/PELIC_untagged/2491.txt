I watched a movie called pan's labrynth by myself . The movie was great fantasy dark and sad. The story took place in Spain in 1944 during the Spanish civil war. There was a girl named ophelia who was very lonely and scared of the war. By that time she had met a fairy and had followed the fairy to underground in order to meet Pan In there Pan had suggested their missions to Ophelia in order for her to return to the underground world as a princess. The three missions had been Courage Patience and Sacrifice. These things had been so hard for her to accomplish but she had tried because she had wanted to return to under world which had been filled with happiness and peace. However she hadn't made it to the world because her step had stepped wrong and she had died. Well while she had been dying she had been able to see the world and meet her parents in fantasy world. It was quite a tragic movie. I thought even if she died she could see the world. But unfortunately she had to die. I was very impressed with the movie.
