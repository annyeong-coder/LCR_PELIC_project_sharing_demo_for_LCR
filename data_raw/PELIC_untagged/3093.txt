I thing frindship is a very important thing which is very important for everyone. My best friend is the one who was living with me in Moscow. Marsel who was living in my neigbor hood is a very good friend for me too. When I was studying in the university I used to invite my friends who are studied with me to my house and our friend whose father was an actor made a lot of shows for us. Moscow is the place that reminds me in a lot of good friends. However here I have friends too my friend who lives in Clevland visites me once a month. In Syria which is my native country I have good friends too. ANON_NAME_0 whose interests are different from mine one of them. I have a friend who lives in italy too. At last I thing friendship is a very good thing and it is like a baby that needs to take care of him always.
