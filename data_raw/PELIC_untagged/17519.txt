Six months ago I went to New York with my friends. It was vacation for two weeks. First of all our trip began from Pittsburgh we brought with us much money and some fruits like orange apple and a lot of banana. Then in fact the way to New York was a long way and it has many cars and a lot of trucks. Next when we approached from New York we saw several towers and many huge buildings my friend said we can't believe our eyes its amazing ! We saw Townsquair and liberty state too. Finally New york the best city which I saw In U. S so our trip to this city was a great trip.
