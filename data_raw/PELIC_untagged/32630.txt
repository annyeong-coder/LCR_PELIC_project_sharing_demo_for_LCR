Abortion Is the abortion murder . The unborn fetus is real life shouldn't be taken and it is result in different medical complication later. It is a fact that unborn fetus is real life and it must not be murdered by an abortion or any other non sense human decision regardless the cause and the needs to that decision. It is known that the human life has begin at conception Therefor abortion just an action of taking human life and the woman who aborted the fetus are just murdere whatever the cause was. Abortion also result in diffrent medical complication later in life such as ectopic pregnancies and it leads to higher the chances of miscarriage 1 and this may also be a kind of a carelessness to other human lifes. Some people may say that woman also have the right to control their body and being the only one responsible of that. I understand that the person has a real civil right to control his her personal condition and take care of his her body but this shouldn't give those people a credite to take someone else's life.
