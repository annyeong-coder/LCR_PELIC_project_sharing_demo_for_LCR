By 2007 I had had my driving license for 5 years. I had been practicing the driving skills in Taiwan for about one month already. I've been spending a lot of time at driving training institution. At the beginning I planned to understand the operation of a clutch from a car. Unfortunately by the time I drove the car the clutch had broken. I had to cancel the practice. After the clutch was fixed my driving progress was smooth. When I had cultivated an enough practicing I decided to register the driving examination. At that time I successful passed my paper test after I read the driver's manual but my road test was almost lost because of the S type driving driving forth and back along the S type trace. Ultimately I had passed the both tests before I found a job. Well although I have a five year driving experience until now I have never forgotten this treasure test experience.
