The best mirror is an old friend George Herbert I agree with him but not always. The friendship is important for human's life. Everyone needs that to continue his life. Everyone needs a friend who gets him advice. The someone who understands him. In my life I have my own opinion about a relationship. I look at my friends as a group but they are different from one to another. The first kind of friend who knows me in general and I know him in general too. He is the someone who meets me many times as a daily or weekly but I couldn't depend him for everything. My best friend who is my cousin I could depend him for everything because I have tried him for many happens. He is the man who reminds me to take the right way in my work or my family's life. He is the man whose job is teacher so he has enough experience about people. I have known another friend since I was 7 years old but he doesn't understand me completely because we haven't met together everyday. His name is ANON_NAME_0 whose home is Qassem. I met him at neighborhood that we grew up there. I feel miss them I hope meet them soon.
