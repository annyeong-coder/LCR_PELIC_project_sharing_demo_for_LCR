I think that frankly speaking ANON_NAME_0 and ANON_NAME_1 who are Native Americans think that 'friends' has more deep meaning than 'buddies'. Friend is a person who can share a more intimate connection with me and who is close to me. However buddy is a person that much more casual and not as close. And buddies can be lots of people that might laugh and have fun together. For example people have buddies whose spare time is spent with them but they have friends whose all time could be spent together in any situation even they are in deep sorrow.
