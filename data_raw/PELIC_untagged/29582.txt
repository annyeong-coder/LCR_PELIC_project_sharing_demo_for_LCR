I think the number 3 greeting is the most important manner. Saying hello is a basic and fundamental conversational skill and after saying it people can start to talk. My mother taught me to say hello not only a person who visited our house but also neighbors if I met them outside. The word hello makes people happy and in particular I feel it in the morning.
