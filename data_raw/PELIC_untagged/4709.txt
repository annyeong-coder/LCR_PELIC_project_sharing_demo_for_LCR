I met my friend Sueyeon while I was reading a textbook in a class. She moved to my town when I was 13 yrs old. When Christmas came she made fancy cards for many friend and I got one. Oneday the whole class sang a new song there were just two students who did not know the song. They were us because the song was for adults. After graduating from an elementary school we met in high school and became best friends.
