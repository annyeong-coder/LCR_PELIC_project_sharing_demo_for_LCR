Before I came to Pittsburgh I thought Korean must dislike Japanses because I've heard Korean could have education about Japan which is not good information. They can't be friendly to Japanses. My mother in law often said so. However many Korean who I met here in Pittsburgh are very nice and friendly. They have good opinion about my country. I regret that I belived the rumore about Korea. I should belive in what others say. Before I belive something I could check it out for myself. I really regret I should have made friends while I was in Japan. Because there are many Koean in my county to learn Japanses. I had a chance to meet them but I didn't try to know about them. I was intersted in them but I belived in the bad rumore about Korea so I didn't talk to them. They also might have made friends with me. I should have talked to them. Now I understand that I don't have to be worry about rumore about the county before getting along with them. I could have been more brave and socialble but it was too hard at that time. It must be a lesson to make friends in my life. Now I have lots of nice Korean friends here in Pittsburgh.
