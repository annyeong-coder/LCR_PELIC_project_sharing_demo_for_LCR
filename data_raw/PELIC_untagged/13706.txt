ANON_NAME_0 is looking forward to apply to a US university that has a good reputation. These days he is so busy to prepare himself for TOEFL. He is going to take a TOEFL test on coming Friday. When he gets a required score he will try to get an academic acceptance from University of Pittsburgh. ANON_NAME_0 told me that after he finishes his study he will go back home. But if he has a good opportunity to work here in the USA he will do so. But in general he will stay in the USA until he finishes his program and then he will go back home. When I have my first baby ANON_NAME_0 is going to visit me. And he told me that he will buy a special gift for my new baby and then I asked him if there is any gift for me he answered me when your hair grows back I will bring you a gift. For that I wish my hair grew back to get a gift from ANON_NAME_0.
