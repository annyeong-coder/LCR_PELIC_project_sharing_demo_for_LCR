When I am in deserted tropical island anyone can't help for me so I must can live by myself. If I live in there by myself I should have somethings. First of all I think that when I stay the deserted tropical island I will feel thirsty. So I should have enough drink to quench my thirsty. Also I must have a lot of something that it can make fire. Because fire is very useful for me. In addition I should have a paper to help me about the place. It's a important thing that find a correct way and it help to find the place there is to protect me. And I need to any signal that call everyone to help me. For example it is similar to flame. Last one is a kind of tool to chop any meat or to cut a lot of wood. I think that It's tools of survival for me.
