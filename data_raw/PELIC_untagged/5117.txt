My hobby is watching Japanese shows. I have been watching Japanese shows since I was 16. I'v watched the show called Pride . It's the story about hockey player's dreams and loves. And I'v also watched the show called orange days . It's the love story between the woman who has disablilty and the man. It's such a beautiful story. I've seen many japanese movies too. I havent been downloading or renting any japanese shows lately. Because it takes long time. However I would still like to enjoy the japanese show.
