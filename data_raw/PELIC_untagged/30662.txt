Cell phone Cell phone is significant thing that what I need in my life. If I don't have a cell phone in my life that maybe affects the relationship between me and my friends my family and my job. First if I don't have cell phone that means I can't connect my friends to hangout or to know if I miss some homework in school. For example if I want hang out on the weekend with my friends how can I contact them. Also if I miss some classes I can't contact my classmate. Second my family always will be worried about me because they will not know where am I or what will happen with me. For instance if I stay all night outside the home with my friends they will not know where am I. Third I need to be connect with my job because if my job have working pressure how they will contact me such as one day when I worked in a municipality my phone turn off so they had working pressure and they needed me but they couldn't contact me. Finally cell phone came to our life to let the people connection each other by easy way and the cell phone was working successful for all these years.
