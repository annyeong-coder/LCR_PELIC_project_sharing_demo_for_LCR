In my case I agree. There are some reasons why I agree. I have a great sense of smell. When I smell the same odor I wonder that they might match one part of section. They could have same idea in their mind. On the other hands I believe that our sense of smell can change our mood and help us remember things. For example the basil has strong fragrance even though you didn't remember eating it. But the sense of smell can help to refresh us memory. I also believe that the scent represent your personal character. The scent belong us together. However the smell is stronger or mild. The aroma could be more attractive for me. But it can not include all things. It's one part of reason how I make a decision.
