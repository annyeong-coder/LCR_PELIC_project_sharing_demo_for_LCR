The most interesting experience I've had with money is happened when I just came to the United States. Here is how it happened. I invited a friend to a restaurant. I knew that I need to tip waiter in an American restaurant so when I paid for the dinner I reminded myself of paying 15 tip which is five dollars. However I made a mistake. In China the size of money is very different. Generally the bigger the size is the higher the amount is. For example the 100 RMB ia the biggest bill and the 1 RMB is the smallest bill. In addition bills in China have different colors so I don't need to see the number on a bill to make sure the amount. In contrast the bills in the United States have same size and color. When I tipped the waiter I wanted to give him five dollars but actually I gave him twenty three dollars. I made a mistake of ten dollar for one dollar twice. You can imagine the reaction of the waiter. The dinner was thirty dollars and I gave him twenty three dollars tip. At last he gave the extra money back But I still feel embarrassing. After then I check the amount of the money twice every time. I really do not want to make the same mistake again.
