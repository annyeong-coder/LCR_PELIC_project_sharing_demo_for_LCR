When I was ten years old I couldn't go online using a computer but now I can. I was only able to type few words a minute. I wasn't able to do a search online but now I can. Before twinty years ago I wasn't able to drive a car but now I can. I was only able to drive a bicycle. I could play soccer but now I can't.
