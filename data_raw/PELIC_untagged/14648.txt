The article A Chimp Off the Old Block Discover magazine January 2002 discusses prodigy chimpanzee Ai and his young son Ayumu demonstrates literary skill by matching Japanese characters to colored shapes on a computer screen. At the Kyoto University Primate Research Institute in Japan was taught Ai to read several dozen characters in kanji. And Ayumu showed researchers that they never taught him before. He may learn himself. They spend time with learning words. 10 Month old Ayumu learns faster than his mother so researchers expect that he will continue to learn simply without having to be coached.
