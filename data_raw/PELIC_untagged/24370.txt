I am living in pittsburgh to studying English and I do not have more free time in weekdays because I have a lot of homework . Also on friday is special day to do any thing I like . Usually when I have free time I like spend my time with my friend or I read any book I like . I have many friends in pittsburgh and I like hang out with them . Usually I meet my friends in the coffee and we keep talk about any interesting subject . Usually I like go to any where with my friend from anther country because I like to learn about the culture . Last week I went with my friend to Amoush country she is from the Us and she taught me many information about the people who life in the Us . When I was child I like to read any thing around me and my father taught me the reading is important part in the live . In the weekend I have special time to reading .
