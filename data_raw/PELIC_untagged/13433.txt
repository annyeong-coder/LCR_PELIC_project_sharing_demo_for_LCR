I was born in Santiago de Chile and studied at the Universidad de Santiago . I have a bachelor degree in Public Administration and have worked in two place before coming to Pittsburgh last Agost. My first job was in the Ministry of Public Works and as an Analist. After that I worked for the Corporacion Municipal de San joaquin as the Manager of Human Resorses that was one of the most important activities in my life because I had direct work witch persons in real social danger. I'have been living in the USA for 2 months and it has been a nice experience. I like this country. . .
