About 2 months ago I had a car accident on Fifth Avenue. There were two cars in the collision. My car got few scrapes in front of the left side and a side view mirror on the driver side was broken. I blamed myself for it. I should have watched out more when I made a left. After two minutes an ambulance came not a police car. Someone got off the ambulance and told the other driver and me that we should have moved away our cars from the lanes. When I heard that I doubted that we shouldn't have taken a picture or made marks before we left. When the cars were moved next to a sidewalk the ambulance left and the driver didn't say anything. So strange! Should I have called 911 I had no idea. After I got a judgment from my insurance agency which told me you might have been right because there is no witness they couldn't believe what we both argued about. So I thought that I shouldn't have moved my car until I got a police record.
