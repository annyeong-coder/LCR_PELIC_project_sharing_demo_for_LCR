The picture was taken approximately 27 years ago. The girl who is sitting in the middle is me. The girl who is sitting on the left is my older sister. I also have an older brother who is posing with watermelon to the camera. I like this picture in which we are enjoying eating pieces of water melon. My sister and my brother are much older than me so they used to cherish me well. My brother who is living in Tokyo now had his first baby girl last year. My sister who is living near our parent's house has already had a daughter and a son. So I have two nieces and one nephew. Interestingly they look similar with us in our childhood. I cannot see them easily because I am living in the US so I really miss them. I am looking forward to having my baby who may look like me.
