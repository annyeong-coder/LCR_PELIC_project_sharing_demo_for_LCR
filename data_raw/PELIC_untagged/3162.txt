I have a friend whose hobby actually is to make more friends. He's a guy who has a very comprehensive and outgoing personality. I don't know how he has the time which he uses to stay in contact with all his friends. The reason for him to be such a friend catcher is because he has so many interests that in some way or another match someone else interests. He's one of those friends who is very supportive social and trustable. He also is the kind of friend whom you can always call to hang out and he's glad to do it.
