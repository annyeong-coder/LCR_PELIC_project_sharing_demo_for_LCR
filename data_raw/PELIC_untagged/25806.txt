When I was 10 years old I couldn't ride a bike but now I can. I learned when I was 12 years old my sister thought me. In my school I took English classes since I was 10 years old. I was able to learn English and I still able. When I was 10 years old I took guitar classes for one year so I could play guitar but now I can't. When I was 10 years old I wasn't able to make decisions in my life but now I'm able to decide whatever I want.
