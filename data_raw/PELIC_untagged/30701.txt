Vities to find fun and share many things. For example we will go traveling have a tea time watch movie watch sport games and do exercise to share our lives. So I always can release my pressures and feel funny with them. Finally travelling around the world is my dream. I hope I can see this world connect with different cultures and taste different types of foods. Moreover I love to make friends who are different country and different culture. Because our life and culture backgrounds are different I usually can find many interesting things from them and love to share my culture to them. Obviously I can expand my field of vision and make a lot of friends from different country by culture exchange and traveling around the world. So if I can travel around the world I could own lots of friends from different country. In conclusion happiness is a significant part in our lives. Many people believe to achieve happiness is their goal of lives which is as same as mine. In my opinion I love getting up date knowledge hanging out with friends or family and visiting different country to chase my happiness. Life is short so we should spend our lives in beautiful and happy things.
