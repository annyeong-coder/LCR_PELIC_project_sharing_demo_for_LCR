The view out my window is very beautiful. My apartment is in the wonderful place Oakland Pittsburgh. My room is on the fifth floor East side so I always get not only warmth in the morning with sunshine but also freshness with a forest on hill. Whenever I look out side my window I will see the hill in the end of my eyes it fill with a lot of tree in the summer and is looked clean by the snow on the winter. On the right hand side I will see a lot of small villages with their gardens this direction is good view to see the sunshine and drink my favorite coffee on the weekend. On the left hand side there are a lot of high buildings Downtown. This side is a nice view at night because I would like to see the light on the buildings whenever I see them I will suddenly miss my country. The last my favorite view is a big garden when I look down at the ground behind the parkings I will see the multicolored from the flower on there. There are many kind of flower. I thing no woman do not like this view. There are the wonderful place behind my window.
