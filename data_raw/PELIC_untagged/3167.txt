Even though my mother wanted to have a son she has four daughters. I have three older sisters. The sister who has been living in Daejun is a Korean discourse teacher. She reads a lot of novels which makes a plentiful imagination. My middle sister has two sons whose hobbies are internet game. My oldest sister whom I like so much lives in Rancho Cucamonga. My mother likes to go to the Spa which most Koreans enjoy doing.
