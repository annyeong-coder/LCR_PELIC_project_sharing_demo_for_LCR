Most people are not wealthy which means that saving money is one approach we can use to improve our life or simply means the only way to become the rich. First of all food cost takes a huge percentage of our monthly spending. Thus the first method I can image to economize is to buy a big refrigerator which stores huge amount of food. Then we are supposed to joint one of the member of the whole sale stores such as COSTCO and SAM's Club. This approach I believe could help us to save at least 30 of the total food spending. Secondly purchasing clothes when they are on sales is also a wise way to save money. Summer clothes for instance are very cheap in autumn sales. Accordingly we can buy summer garments of all kinds for the next year. Further we can take advantages of credit card companies. To achieve this means that we should do everything stated above to earn oil discount free gifts or bigger discount which depends on activities that are held by credit card companies irregularly. There are still many methods we do not know to save money and I believe these are the differences between most of the people and those who are wealthy.
