Because the owner does not have money he could not provide the the factors of success. From my perspective the best solution is the owner borrows some money. The money is defiantly will make essence changes and that will make the restaurant stands on his feet again. For example by the money he can make ads and distributes them to all students and to the neighborhoods. Moreover he will be able to hire professionals cooks and afford them. Professional's cooks who prepare special and delicious food will attract a lot of customers and that will make the restaurant rake in thousands of dollars. To sum up if the owner gets a loan he will be able to make enough ads to make his restaurant popular all over the city and he will be able to afford the professionals cooks.
