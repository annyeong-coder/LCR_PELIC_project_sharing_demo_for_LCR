1. I think there are many possible reasons for the Maya's abandonment. Firstly they might not have had enough food because their population may have increased too fast. Second the huge hurricane could have attacked them. That entire area always has hurricane. Third they might have thought that that area was dangerous because another tribe often attacked them. Moreover another tribe may have attacked them so they abandoned their cities. Finally this idea which is the most likely is they might have gotten epidemic. Many people could have died and they couldn't have found the way to treat so they suddenly left their cities and never returned.
