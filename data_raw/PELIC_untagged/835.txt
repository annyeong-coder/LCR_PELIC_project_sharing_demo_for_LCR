Sorry I am late because I was absent when you assumed this homework. I hope you would accept my homework. In addition I didn't well for all my exams I wish you would give me an excuse because I have to prepare for TOFEL test which it is very important and it takes most my time this semester. Last week I had a test and I wish I could pass it but the test was difficult. I hope I would be younger to understand English clearly because my memory doesn't help any more to study new vocabulary. Last year I started my major degree in my country which was master of accounting. Because this major is with English language I thought that it is better to study this major in the USA and I thought one year is enough for studying English but now I believe one year isn't enough to be in classes with native speakers. I hope I could study hardly since I came here. In addition I wish I will be in business school after a few months.
