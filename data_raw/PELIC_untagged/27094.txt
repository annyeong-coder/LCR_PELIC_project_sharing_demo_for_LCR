Before I came to the U. S. I had never driven anywhere by myself in my country where I lived people usually take public transportation but my cousin always dropped me off at the skytrain station and I took the train everywhere. It was easier. I had never gone to the night club and drunk alcohal. I think it's dangerous and feel unsafe in my country but here is different and my friends were always hang out there during weekend now not much anymore. I had never eatten alone in the restaurant but as I'm here by myself I have to and a lot of people also do the same no one care if you are sitting alone but in my country it looks different. I had never eatten bagle and cream cheese but now it is my favorite breakfast. I had never worn necklace because the weather is hot and humid when I wear it I will get rash all over my neck but here I feel fine with it I got a necklace on my birthday last year I've been wearing it since then.
