Saudi Women Have Busy Live Many Saudi women have busy lives. Some women have a job. A lot of these women might be able to read and write. In all cities there are many schools. Most women can go to school and university. Usually Saudi houses are large and have a lot of rooms so they need help with home chores like cooking cleaning and taking care of the family. Normally most women enjoy fashion. I believe many women like traditional clothes but they like to change them to dresses and they take new ideas from other fashions. For me I lived with my family in a big house and I went to school when I was 6 years old until I got my bachelor degree from university. I was thinking about getting a job but I came to U. S. With my husband. In my opinion Saudi women are free to do what they want to do and I am happy to be a Saudi woman because I think they are special.
