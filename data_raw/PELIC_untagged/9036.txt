About two monthes ago I went to a hairdresser's shop. I was really not good at explain something in English then so I answered to the hairdresser who gave me a haircut just yes . I shouldn't have answered to her that. I ought to have tried asking her what I wanted or I could have learned about some words which are related with haircut at least. Anyway she gave me a strange haircut my side and back hair was straight at the end. I wonder that I should have asked other hairdresser and if I did that what could be changed. Maybe nothing. Now I think I should have gone to other shop.
