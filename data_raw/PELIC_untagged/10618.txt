On January 6 2008 I moved to the United States. My life is totally changed. For example first in Pittsburgh I go to bed at 11 30pm but in my country I went to bed at 3am. Second in Tunisia I met my friends just on the weekends but here I meet my friends all day. Then here I take one bus to go to the university but in my country I took two buses. Finally I had a lot of friends in Tunisia but at Pitt I have just three friends.
