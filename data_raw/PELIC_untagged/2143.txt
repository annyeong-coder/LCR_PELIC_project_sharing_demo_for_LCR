The snow covered trees will be very beautiful and wonderful. It will be very big and the color will be gray and white. It will be tall and slender. The snow on their trees will not melt or blow away without sunshine and strong wind. Also the snow that is in the top of tree will just look like a human's head. It will look like nuns who are in prayer with their heads bowed like drunks falling asleep at a bar.
