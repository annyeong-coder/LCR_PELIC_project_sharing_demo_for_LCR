A friend in need is a friend indeed means someone who helps you when you are in need is a true friend. I agree with this statement. When I was at the University of Samoa my girlfriend Hannah who was a Peace Corps Volunteer in my country helped me by paying my registration fee at the beginning of the second semester. This was something I had never experienced before that changed my understanding of relationships with friends. My girlfriend who's from America loves to help people that need assistance. Hannah's friends whose needs may include personal or professional problems depend on her often for her knowledge understanding and skills. In my typical day which may include a lot of traveling class work and homework Hannah helps make my day easier in many ways.
