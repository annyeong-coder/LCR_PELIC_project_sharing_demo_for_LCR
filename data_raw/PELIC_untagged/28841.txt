Topic 2 Viewpoint B High schools should not be in session all year long. Many high schools have summer vacation. Students can travel to foreign country and make friends in summer vacation. High school students should not be in session all year long because they need to develop their personality and rest for their health. Students need to improve their personality and they can learn it while looking outside school. They can meet a lot of people and discover the new things that they can't learn at school. Summer vacation is very good oppotunity to travel to foreign country and make friends. After graduating high school they will be very busy and it is very difficult to have own time. Students need to rest for their health because they will be exhausted if they study in session all year long. They are young and they have to make their health more healthy. When I was a high school student I had to go to the school every Saturday. I only had Sunday to rest. This was very hard and I always felt tired. If they can gain time to rest they will study more comfortably. To study in summer vacation has some benefit. Even though Studying will be a beneficial for every students and if they study in summer vacation they finish school earliar and they can get a job on young age but it is more important to have rest and improve their personality for them. High school students can improve their personality to have rest and look outside school. So they should not be in session all year.
