An elderly person I respect is my grandmother. When I was young my grandmother demanded I save money into piggy bank 5 baht everyday. My grandma said It's essential that I save money. At that time I didn't understand why. Until one day I want to bought a video game but my father doesn't bought it for me. I was very sad and then I realized that I have money in my piggy bank. I went to a shopping mall and bought a video game by my own money. I was proud of myself. If I hadn't saved money I wouldn't have bought a video game. It's important for me to buy a video game.
