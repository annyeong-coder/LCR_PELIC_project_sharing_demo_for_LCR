Before I came to Pittsburgh there are many things I had never done. I had never had friends from other countries. Now I have friends from South Korea Japan and other countries. I had never lived by myself. At first I was afraid but now I got used to it. I had never attended the classes that taught in English. I had never had snow in Oct before I came to Pittsburgh. In my country we usually have snow in Dec and Jan. Also I had never been to a church before I came to Pittsburgh.
