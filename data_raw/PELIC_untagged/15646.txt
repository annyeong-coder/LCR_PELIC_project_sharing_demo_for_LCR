I had an experience that taught me intuitive decition is better than logical thinking. One day I while I was walking to my school and I met this woman. She was asking me for a money. She said she had lost her wall so she need a money to call taxi to get home. She convinced me if I lend her a money she'll call me tomorrow and give it back to me. My inner voice was telling me not to lend ger a money because she might be lieing at me. On the other hand she was giving me her phone number and logically her story seemed true so I lend her 15 dollars. When the day past she didn't call me. I recognized the phone number isn't existing. If I have had checked her number I wouldn't have lost my money. I wish I had checked her number before. If I meet any strangers like her I will never lend them a money.
