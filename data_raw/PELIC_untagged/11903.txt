My favorite restaurant where I usually have my lunch is an Italian restaurant called Vennesia located in Oakland near the Public Park. This restaurant is rather big built with an Italian style and light lightening all which form a gorgeous setting. The restaurant is very tidy and offers a great variety and wide range of delicious Italian dishes. Besides that waiters are helpful tactful and very friendly. They come from time to time to your table to ensure your comfort. In addition meals are offered at a good temperature with reasonable prices. The restaurant motto is customer satisfaction comes at top priority . I always enjoy my favorite lovely meal Spaghetti with Sausage sauce followed by Italian ice cream. Finally I advise every one to try it and once you try it you can not avoid it.
