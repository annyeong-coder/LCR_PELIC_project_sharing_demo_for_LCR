My impression of Memorial Day Yesterday was Memorial Day I didn't find anything was different. It's a ordianry day. For me the surprise about Memorial Day was o buses running outside downtown. I have been living here more than ten months I have been saw American how to celebrate Thanksgiving Christmas but it's the frist time to know Memorial Day. I had an experience about didn't have bus running on Christmas. At that time I wanted to go to downtown. I was waiting for bus one hour at street finally someone told me no bus on Christmas. It's different with China. In China whatever chinese new year or Festival we still have bus run on these days. I thought American will do so but I was wrong. I don't have a car so I need to take bus I thought if you want to live in American you must own a car. It's one of the most important thing to live in the United State.
