HEALTHCARE Health care is one of the basic necessities which governments should provide for their citizens. A lot of governments support education or provide it free because those governments consider education as the most important basis to build an intellectual generation that supports development of a society. This concept is right but it is not achieved unless there is good healthcare for those people whom we expect to develop their communities. This idea is based on an old proverb a healthy mind is a healthy body''. Not all citizens have money to spend on healthcare or to go to a hospital. In all communities there are poor families that cannot provide food to feed their children let alone pay for health insurance or medication and also homeless who do not have a place to live. These people are suffering from a lot of diseases but they cannot visit a doctor or go to a hospital because of the high costs or a lack of money. The question is that on who falls responsibility of treating these people The answer is either governments' help or slow death. When governments provide health care for those families they help to stop spreading diseases among the members of a community. Shortly some governments spend a large part of their budget on education and health because they know that education and health underlie the evolution of nations. Although healthcare is very expensive and governments spend a lot of money on it it is the right of citizens that should be provided by the government as education that majority of governments support.
