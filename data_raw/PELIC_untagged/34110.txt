My husband used to put his car keys on the table which is next the bed. This is an obvious indication that he is in the house. Last night as I was preparing the lunch my son asked me to help him in doing his math homework. I told him to ask his father but my son did not find his father. I said your father couldn't have left the house can't you see his keys
