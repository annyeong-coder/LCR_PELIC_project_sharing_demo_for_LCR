I think it damages the environment and rely on the information in the article the damage affects the neutral environment and the culture tradition . Also the benefits of the tourisms are complex. For example visiting forest requires driving the tourism with a car to make sure they are on safe from wide animals. At this point the car exhausts gasoline and gets out carbon dioxide. Time after time all these times destroy the environment whit out noticing it. Yet the money is earned however is that equal the damage. In fact there is no completely dogmatic response for this question. In my point view tourism does not have any benefits if not be limited and organized it on the good way.
