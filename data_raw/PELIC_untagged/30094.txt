The food faux pas that bother me is when someone burps. I think it's bad behavior during the eating. I think it makes the people who eating beside that person fell disgusting. The people in my country don't like that may be because that I explained in the top of this paragraph or because the culture says that. Also in my country it's impolite to eat by left hand but this faux pas is related to the religion.
