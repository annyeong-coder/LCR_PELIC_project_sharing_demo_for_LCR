In the argument the author attempts to convince us that Good luck has nothing to do with success. At first glance I agree with it but after further thinking I think Good luck has its meaning to do with success for me. For example during the time I prepared for my GRE test which was boring and hard job for me but each time when the members of my famiy or freinds told me good luck for your test taht made me felt more confident to continue preparing the test. Another example when the firest time I went to introview for the job my family told me good luck before I went and I got position. Therefore in my point of view good luck is some meaning to do with success to me.
