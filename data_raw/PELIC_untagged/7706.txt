1. Do spend time getting to know someone I think I'm not interested to know other people online. The first one reason is too dangerous. I also have lot friends. I don't need waste time to meet other people online. On the other hand talking online is too difficult to know each other totally. I'm a sociable person and I'd prefer face to face. That will be easier to know each other. I like to help each other before we can be a good friend. 2. Do get specific in your online profile I disagree. I am quite private. I unknown you before I don't like to share anything with you. But if you are my friends I'm glad to share my feeling with you. The other reason when I saw these personal profiles online it's difficult to judge what right or wrong is. Finally I don't like to know other people online.
