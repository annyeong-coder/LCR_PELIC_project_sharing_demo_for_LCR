I think practicing a sport regularly is a good use of time. Some people feel the urge to spend several hours a day playing a sport others spend only a few minutes a day doing their exercises. In any case we all involve in physical activity for the sake of staying healthy and fit. And when we can do it with a buddy it makes it even more fun.
