My goal is to get M. A. And PHD in mechanical engineering. There are many things I must to do to achieve my goals. First I have already improved my English language to help while I am studying but I still haven't passed TOEFL exam. Second I haven't got admission yet so I need to get it as soon as possible. I have already studied hard. Furthermore I have already reviewed my knowledge. In addition I still haven't Learned how to write essay very well. Also I haven't focused in my major yet but I planned to do that. Moreover I still haven't done any research. Finally I haven't asked any experts yet to help me in any decisions .
