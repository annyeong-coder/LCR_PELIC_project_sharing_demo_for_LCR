I was born and grew up in Vietnam. My country is one of the third countries. I lived in the middle of Vietnam where is very beautiful and has many wonderful landscapes. I studied and lived many places because I parents had their own business which had to move. Since I was in high school I had an independent life. After that I had studied in a Science University in southern of Vietnam. So I came to the U. S to study when I had been a junior student. Before I was in the U. S I had traveled some countries alike Cambodia Laos and Thailand. There are my neighbor countries where have many wonderful places include temples pagodas and royal palaces. They were interesting. I have been in the U. S for more than year and I have been studying with many friends from many countries. Since I came here until now I've studied English in the ELI 2 full time semesters and a half time semester. It was difficult to me. So I need to try to study more than more because my goal of study in the U. S is studying and getting an high degree in university.
