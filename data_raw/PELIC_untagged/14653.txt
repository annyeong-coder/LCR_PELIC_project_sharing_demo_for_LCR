In POLITICS AS USUAL ANON_NAME_0 Childress illustrates about that Franklin Roosevelt battled with polio and confronted the disease. Both Franklins wife Eleanor and Franklins mother Sara despaired of his future in politics because in the early 1900s people thought that a crippled persons political career was impossible. However Eleanor knew how important Franklin was in politics and heard from the doctor that it was important to encourage him for his recovery she encouraged him to stay in politics. Louis Howe Franklins political adviser also helped him to keep his illness from the general public. Franklin kept exercising to walk. In 1924 Franklin could not refuse the Democratic National Convention and nothing was wrong with his speech. For years later Franklin still needed rehabilitation but he noticed that he shouldnt keep avoiding the nomination for governor because of his illness. Franklin Roosevelt came back to politics with his illness and that encouraged many people and proved his leadership.
