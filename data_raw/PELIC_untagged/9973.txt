In my opinion I don't believe unexplainable mysterious things and abilities because I've never seen these kinds of thing before. Actually I've already read many articles and books about psychic ability. I think if these abilities are true it'll be great to reduce crime rate and helpful to find out criminal. However I couldn't see and hear specific report about psychic on the news. I agree with Nickell it's a just guesses. Even though someone like Martin could anticipate or find out more specific proofs and evidences than scientific research it will be just lucky guesses with basic demonstrate processes. If someone has real skills of psychic he she will be not a real human.
