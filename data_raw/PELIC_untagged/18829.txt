I do not have any plan after the semester ends right now. Because I applied for admission to more than university but I did not get any responce from them I am still waiting. If I get an acceptance letter from one of them I will stay here until I finish the master degree in physical therapy but if I did not get this letter I will return to back my country to change my study's area. Maybe I will go to the UK or Australia. Also I signed up for the TOEFL test that will be on Aug 15. So I have to wait until I do this test. I hope to get my master degree from here.
