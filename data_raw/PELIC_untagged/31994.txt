Hello my name is Hatem and I am form Medina in Saudi Arabia . In 2004 I moved to Riyadh to study master degree by the end of 2007 I received master degree. I had been teaching in college for three years. At this time I have been studying in ELI institute. I am interesting in swimming but it is difficult to do that in Pittsburgh because there is no beach and the weather is cold. Also I love traveling abroad therefore I have visited many countries such as France Spain Switzerland and Malaysia.
