I enjoy trying unusual dishes because I like to change to another dishes . I like also to know the other's cultures . Sometime I discover delicious dishes in other countries . When I eat an ethnic food I know the customs of the particular country . What they like and what they don't like so when I deal with someone I already know his food costumes I won't be in an embarrassed situation .
