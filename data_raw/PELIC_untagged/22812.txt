When I was in high school I used to have long hair but now I don't. When I was in high school I never used to worry about money but now I do. Actualy I used to have a lot of hobbies but now I don't have any free time. Before I used to travel with my family a lot but now I don't. When I was in high school I used to care a lot about my appearance. Now I'm too busy to care how I look. Me and my friends used to play tennis but now we don't.
