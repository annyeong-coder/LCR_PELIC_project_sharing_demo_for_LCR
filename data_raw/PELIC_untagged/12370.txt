I would like to talk about my flow state which I experienced recently. I was afraid of writing in English when I was in Korea because I couldn't convince whether my draft is correct. However I had realized that I became enjoying English writing through following happening. Do you have ever heard a word Sukwonable Sukwonable consists of two parts ANON_NAME_0 is radix means a natural disaster and able is suffix indicating tendency so meaning of Sukwonable is terrible or horrible. You might wonder what ANON_NAME_0 is. ANON_NAME_0 is a man who is studying in the ELI and was my classmate. As I said a moment ago meaning of Sukwonable is terrible but some ELI teachers ANON_NAME_1 ANON_NAME_2 and Carol who taught him disagree with me. They have acknowledged Sukwonable has a positive meaning so I had to argue with them about the meaning by e mail. The teachers are being overprotective of him but I thought what ANON_NAME_0 needs is a stick not a carrot. The argument was hard work to me but I didn't notice what time it was during writing. I think that this case is a kind of flow state.
