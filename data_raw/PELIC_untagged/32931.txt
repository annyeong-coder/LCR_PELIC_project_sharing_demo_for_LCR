Good evening my new classmates. I would like to tell you a few things about myself. My name is ANON_NAME_0 I am from Saudi Arabia and I have been here in U. S since last Jan. I am studying English here in pittsburgh in order to join one of U. S Universities to start my master program when I successfully pass the TOEFL test. However I like football I used to play football before I injured my knee for the second time actually I am watching a football match while I am writing this to you my friends. Furthermore I would enjoy my time with watching movies and sometimes I spend six continuously hours living with movies.
