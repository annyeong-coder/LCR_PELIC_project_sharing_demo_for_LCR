Last Satuarday I went to Washington D. C with my family. Initially I went to the Lincoln Memorial. There was a huge statue of Lincoln who thrived on a lot of things in the U. S history. After I went to the Korean War Veterans Memorial where I could see many statues of korean army. Also it is coordinated like situation of War. I felt sorry about victims of war. Then I went to National Gallery of Art but we don't have much time to see everyting. Because I can't access there after 5p. M. At that night I had dilemma. The next day we have few time so I have to choose going up Washington Monument or going Solar energy house exhibit. I really wanted to go to Washington Monument however I couldn't go because I woke up too late. Although I couldn't go what I'd wanted go and stayed there just two days it was really nice trip. If I could have another chance I would like to go wahington again.
