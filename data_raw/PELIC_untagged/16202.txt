In my country many myths there tell about imaginative thoughts. First I am going to talk about guy loved king's daughter but the king didn't need to give his daughter to that guy. Therefore he was poor. After that he decided to be rich. Then he traveled to another city it is located on the magic area. However he didn't know that and he lived with old man whilst this old man was the biggest magic in the city. Magician told the guy to read book that he gave it him but there was old maid in the house and she was a good woman. She forbad him from reading the book and she told him this book was read by many people then the magician controlled them. Like all the people in the city were controlled by the magician. Secondly she told him to read all the books in the magician's library to learn how to magic. Every day the magician asked the guy Did you complete the book then guy said Not yet. The magician said You are dumb. Continually the guy read another books and kept that book. Next the magician fired the guy. Thirdly the magician was known the guy read all the books after that the magician was searching about the guy but he went back to the king to tell him he rich man now with his magic. While the magic ability for the guy was watched by the king and all his family the magician came to kill the guy because he knew all the information about the magic. Then they started fighting with magic ways. Fortunately the guy killed the magician after a long fighting. Finally the guy got married from the girl that he loved.
