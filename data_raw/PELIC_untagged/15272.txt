The buses schedule are not accurate in Pittsburgh. What happened with me is a great example. I had a lunch reservation in a big restaurant in Pittsburgh downtown to meet my friend at 2 00 P. M. So I got out of my home at 1 15 P. M. To catch the 1 20 P. M. Bus. I was waiting for the bus but it didn't showed up. After 30 minutes the bus came and I wasn't able to arrive on time to the restaurant. Actually my reservation was been cancelled.
