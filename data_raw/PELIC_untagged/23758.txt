My ideal apartment I want to have a largely space apartment. It must to have many function room. First I have a king size bed. I can sleep comfortably. Next in living room it made up of digital machine. Such as a hung style TV with a pair of stereo and a DVD. Then it is amazing to watching movie. It had better have a guest room my friends can live in that if we have a party. Finally I do not have a great kitchen it only have enough space for cooking and some kitchenware. I think everyone wants it.
