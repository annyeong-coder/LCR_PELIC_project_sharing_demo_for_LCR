A Yes she is a nice girl but her boyfriend is not as nice as her! He is a jerk! B You must feel really bad because you have never talked about a person like this. A I can't control my temper any more! Every time when he comes to our apartment he never takes off his shoes and that makes my carpet very dirty!

B Wow you must be in a big trouble! A I could not store any food in my refrigerator otherwise he will eat all of them without telling me! B He might be very hungry. A Oh you must be kidding me! He was not just eating my food but also using my towel! B Hum it must be rude or he may not know that's your towel. A No he thought that's her girlfriend's towel. In this morning he even smoked in my apartment and burnt my couch! B Oh my god! That must be dangerous! You had to stop him! A You see if I still leave with my roommate her boyfriend will burn my whole apartment! What should I do now B Don't worry. I am able to help you. Let's look up online and see if you can find a new apartment. A Thank you!
