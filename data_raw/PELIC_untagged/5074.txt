I have nice kitchen in my new house. First of all it is bigger than my old kitchen. Second of all in the main entrance on your right there is a big oven. Then beside the oven there is a small microwave. Next to the microwave there is a big Fraser. On your left there is very large table to eat the food and drink coffee. Finally in front of the Fraser there is a small door to go out of the kitchen. My new kitchen is more convenient more than my old kitchen.
