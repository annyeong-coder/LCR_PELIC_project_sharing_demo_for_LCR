Milwaukee Madison Franklin who is the captain of this team lost his mother. She died at a local hospital because of a cancer. Some of his teammates were in the hospital. They tended to cancel the game but Franklin refused. He insisted on playing the game. Coaches and Referees Suddenly Franklin came directly from the hospital to the game place to play. But the referees said that putting him in means a technical foul because he wasn't on the list. Barbs They didn't want the foul but that's the rule the referees said. McNeal who played the foul deliberately missed the goal. I did it for the guy who lost his mother McNeal said.
