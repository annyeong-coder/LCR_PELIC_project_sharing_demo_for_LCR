Hi Dongfang I was so glad to get your letter yesterday and you said you bought a desktop. Now I'm planning to buy a computer too. We only have two computers one desktop and one laptop. You know three of us in our family like to use computers so we often lack one especially during weekends or vacation days. We decided to buy a new computer but we argued for a long time about buying a laptop or desktop. You know each one has advantages and disadvantages. First desktops usually have large space in the hard disk and the memory cards but it's easy to move for laptops. Second desktops often run faster than laptops. If you use the computer to edit video or make three dimensional objects desktops are better than laptops. However if you have a laptop you can use it or go online anywhere for example at home on the plane in the car and on the park. Finally if I buy a desktop I can add another hard disk memory cards and DVD CD driver. In contrast I can't do these with a laptop. We don't make the decision until now so please give me your advice. OK I have to do something right away so we can have a chat again next time. Have a good day!
