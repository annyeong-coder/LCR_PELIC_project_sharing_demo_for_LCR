Hello good morning everyone. My name is Kyung Jong Last Name but I am always being called as Joe in the ELI. Did you have good breakfast Today I am going to share with something about my personality. My first personality is that I'm moderate. That means I am not going to far. For example I sometimes like to stay calm place listening soft music but I sometimes want to go to feel people's high energy in bustling place. It is different from capricious and lack of decision. I am just generous and open minded. Also I am always trying to see issues from diverse perspective. For instance I can understand ANON_NAME_0 even if she gives me F grade. My final personality is that I'm honest. I feel it really difficulty to lie. Besides everyone easily aware that I'm lying whenever I try to lie. Therefore I've just learned to try to be honest. It's all about my personality. Thank you.
