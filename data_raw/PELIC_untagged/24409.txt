When I came to the United States I saw the bus on which disabled person tried to get. I was surprised by the fact that nobody complained to the bus driver about delay. The fact that no cars made a klaxon on the road made me more surprised and looked nice. Everyone waited for the disabled person. That is why the reason that I like and respect American culture. Developed culture does not mean rich culture. I think that developed culture is that all the people are equal.
