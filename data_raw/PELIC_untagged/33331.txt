One year ago I was thinking about come to USA to learn English. I had been working at the University Hospital in my hometown when I decided to come here. I had never thought to quit my job before that day when I finally decided it. When I started to complete the requirements and all related with my new life I felt so exited and nervous. The time passed so fast and during that time I had been learning information about Pittsburgh when I bought my round trip flight. I hadn't traveled for a long time before that but I was sure that I can do it. After this happened my family and friends had been giving to me many lucky words and the last day before my flight they did a meeting for my farewell. It was to nice and now I think that it was the best decision that I have taken!
