My personal success was my work experiences. I used to work in a bank my duty was handled customers' arguments and found anything about the other department's problems. Then suggested them how to improve. Most of time we should solve customer's arguments. Sometimes customers argued something that wasn't our fault but we needed try to soften their bad emotion. Sometimes their arguments came from our bank's fault. At that time we needed to do three things. First I express my apology for customer. Second I needed to find the primary cause and solution. Finally I called customer again and told them what we did and said thanks for their arguments or suggests. I've been proud of myself that I can do my job well
