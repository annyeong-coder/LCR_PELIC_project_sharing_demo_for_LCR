The favorite dish of our family is a cabbage soup Schi from the Russian cuisine. This soup is very delicious and easy to cook. I love to cook this soup on Sunday so we can eat it during the week. In my family we usually serve the soup with sour cream greens and dried breadcrumbs. If you want to cook this soup you should follow these steps. First you need to prepare all the ingredients. Take one pound of meat pork or beef with bones one pound of cabbage one medium onion two carrots one large sweet red pepper two celery sticks one can of diced tomatoes one tablespoon of olive oil and a teaspoon of each basil oregano and rosemary. Salt and pepper can be added to your taste. When you are ready you can begin. In the beginning fill a large pot with water and bring it to boil. Add well washed meat to the boiling water and cook over low heat for about two hours. While the meat is cooking chop the onion carrots celery and red pepper. Then add olive oil to a pan and saut e salt pepper oregano basil rosemary and stir the mixture over low heat for 10 minutes. When the meat is ready separate it from the bones and slice sift the broth through a strainer. Next cut the cabbage in small slices and put them into the broth. Finally add the vegetables and slices of meat to the pot and cook for another 15 minutes. Schi is a great dish for the whole family.
