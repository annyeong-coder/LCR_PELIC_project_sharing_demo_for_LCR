ANON_NAME_0 I've got to have a considerable amount on money. MUMU Be real! You can't spend that money on a desert island. There can't be any stores there. ANON_NAME_0 O. K. I may take goggles and a dust mask. MUMU Great Idea! You think that the desert island might have dust storms. ANON_NAME_0 I must take along some canned food. MUMU Really! It must be so heavy. I think we had better bring some water rather than those canned food. ANON_NAME_0 I agree with you so we have to bring goggles a dust mask and some water.
