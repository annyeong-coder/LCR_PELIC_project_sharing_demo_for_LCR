If tourism to my home country were to double in the next 20 years this would be ambiguous. It means it would be good and be bad. First good thing is that my country can generate a lot of properties like revenue form tourism growing tourism industry which leads to coordinate other industry. Also it is good chance to show our country's culture which foreigners will acknowledge. They might clarify what is real our country's culture. The bad thing is our city could be crowded because of tourists who sometimes can trigger the people who live in our country being annoying.
