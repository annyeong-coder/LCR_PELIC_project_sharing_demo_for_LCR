When you come to a vacation in Israel there are several things that you should do. You ought to be in The Western Wall in Jerusalem. Another thing to do is to hang out in the beach in Tel Aviv. And if we already speaking about the beach you should go to the Dead Sea it's a great unique place. Riding a camel can be a fun experience. You ought to eat a local food it's yummy!!! You shouldn't hitchhike. You shouldn't wear a suit.
