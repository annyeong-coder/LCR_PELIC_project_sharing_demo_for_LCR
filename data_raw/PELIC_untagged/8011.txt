My country Korea has 'New Years Day. ' It is on January first. At that time Korean people eat 'DDuk kuk. ' Its ingredients are rice cake white soup scallions garlic eggs seaweed salt and pepper. Even thought I eat many times I do not know the recipe. When people eat 'DDuk kuk' it means that Korean people become one year older. We calculate different age ways. 'DDuk kuk' is poured by bowl with seaweed and eggs of decorations. We can use spoon and chopsticks.
