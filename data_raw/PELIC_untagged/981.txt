When I was a child I liked to go to my grandmother's home where my cousins lived. Because I have only one younger brother and I wanted to have more partners. Thus almost everyday I went to my grandmother's home after school where we can play balls TV games and poker. Sometimes I also ate dinner in my grandmother's home when my aunt cooked dinner that night. If I went there after school sometimes I would forget to write my homework because there are too many partners and games waiting for me! Therefore my mother forbad me to go to my grandmother's home before I finish my homework. I only can go to my grandmother's home when I had no homework or on the weekend. Although there was a ban for me I couldn't stop thinking to go to my grandmother's home where was the most interesting place for me. After few years my grandmother moved to another place where was far from my house thus I only had a few chances to go to my grandmother's home and played with my cousins. However my grandmother's home is the most entertaining place where I could go everyday when I was a child.
