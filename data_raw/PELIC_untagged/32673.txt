If I had stayed in the same neighborhood I would have met other people who would have become my friends. I wouldn't have met my best friend. Had I followed my friends I might have studied management. If I hadn't went to USA to study master I would be working as child psychologist in my country. Had not I specialized in Psychology I wouldn't volunteer as a psychologist during jeddah disaster in 2009. If I had studied in London I would have vist my family each vacation.
