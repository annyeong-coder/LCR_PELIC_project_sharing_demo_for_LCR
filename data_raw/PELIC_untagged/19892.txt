I was impressed by the movie Lump of Sugar which features my favorite actress Yim Soo ANON_NAME_0. The movie is set in the island of Cheju where the heroine was born and raised. She was a passionate lover of horses. She and horses shared a deep relationship. In the pastures of horses she especially took a liking to the horse named Thunder who also liked her. Both lost their mother at birth. Characters the heroine and Thunder matured and relied on each other for spiritual support that one's parents would give to their child. They shared a bond that was unbreakable. One day when Thunder was sold to another farm the two were separated tearfully with painstakingly recognizable sadness. Two years later the heroine who dreamed of becoming a rider comes across her forgotten friend Thunder once again. With instruction of her Thunder enters a horse racing derby. The story of the interrelationship between all things including animals and humans are presented as an influence in this theatrical production that will surely blow away the audience. The heroine and Thunder in front of thousands of people will ride in their final race. Finally they won everybody was crazy about their fantastic racing. After the game Thunder's health was getting worse he died of weakness. This movie which impressed me deserves to be watched.
