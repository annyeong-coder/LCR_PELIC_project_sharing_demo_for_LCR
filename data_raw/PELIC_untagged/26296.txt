I Live in big area it is call highland park. It is butfaul here there are many of trees and many of people. I love this area because we have a park where people can hang out togthere. In my home there six big bedrooms and four bathrooms. And there a big living room where we sit everyday. Before I came to USA I tried to find a good place to live but I could not and some of my friend told me about highland and there I am here. The life here is good and I will never feel bad because I choose this place.
