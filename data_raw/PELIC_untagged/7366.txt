First of all I think the most affecting thing that made you interested to buy the product is the advertisements. When we go to anywhere we will see or hear advertisements in the TV radio and pictures for the product. The second thing is hearing something from you friend. When you are talking to your friends I'm positive that they will talk about something they have tried and they like. Then you will go to any market and fiend that think because you are curios to try it. Finally I think every company is trying to make you interested to buy their goods somehow and the successful marketing company will make you doing that.
