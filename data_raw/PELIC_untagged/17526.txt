If I won the lottery I would do several things such as traveling around the world building a house and donating some money. Firstly I would travel all over the world with my family and close friends. We would eat traditional foods in each country and see lots of beautiful famous places as much as we could. Of course I would pay all of them because I am extremely rich. The second way to use the huge amount of money is to build my ideal house. I would have a very convenient and fashionable house in another country. I collect my favorite furniture from many different countries when I travel around world. Consequently I have much money I do not care about the cost for the new house when I construct my house. Finally I may donate the rest of my money for the needy people in the world because I still have much money nevertheless I have already enjoyed my lottery money. Especially I want to use the money for the people who suffer from the poverty and cannot get enough education. In conclusion if I got a thirty million six hundred thousand dollars in the lottery I would use it to travel build the house and donate.
