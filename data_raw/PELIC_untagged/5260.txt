My partner is John he comes from Turkey. Before he comes to ELI he thinks that he will be happy while he is in ELI class. When he finishes ELI class he will go to an university in USA or find a job. He won't find a part time job until he finds a full time job. If he can not go to an university or find a job in USA he will go back to Turkey. I wish that he will find a job or go to an university as soon as he finishes ELI program.
