In today's many countries overcrowded cities face many crimes and it has become a big problem of the world that is likely to continue into the future. As such some people say that money is the root of all evil but I disagree with it. First of all money is just a tool of exchange. If money did not exist people would target other commodity in their crimes. Before invention of money humans used the barter system of trading objects for other objects or services but even then humans had problems. For example Opium War was fought between British and China from 1839 to 1842 with the aim of forcing China to import opium. As a result of high demand for tea silk and porcelain in Britain and the low demand for British commodities in China Britain had a large trade deficit with China and this was reason of the war. Additionally bad things is not money but desire for money and others. In capitalism money is the obvious measure of one's status and sometimes it brings other people jealousy. When I was freshman in university there was murder case of O. J. Simpson who killed his wife and the man he thought was her boyfriend. I knew he is very famous and successful football player in America. However it has nothing to do with money and it is Jealousy about women. In summary I think money is not the root of all evil and people that do bad things in order to obtain what they desire is evil.
