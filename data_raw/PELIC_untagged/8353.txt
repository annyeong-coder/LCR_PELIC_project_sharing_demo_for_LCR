The golf is mental sport because I have to do a lot of think and I take a lot of practice and effort. I started to learn to play golf for my job in 1990. I had taken to learn to play golf to private teacher teaching pro about 5 months before I first went to a country club. I had been thinking about why I have to learn to play golf when I learned to play golf to private teacher. Sometimes I was practicing golf swing while I wasn't eating lunch. I've been playing golf since I learned to play golf. I've already won the competition but I've never gotten hole in one yet.
