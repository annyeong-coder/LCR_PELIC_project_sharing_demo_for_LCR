My feeling with my apartment is free. Because I play around play station 2 at the same time I turn music on. Ever time I can turn on my computer and send homework out to teacher. Sometime I turn TV up and work Toefl out all of this make me cheer up. But I don't like clean up my room and dirty dish. I always turn my behavior into eat out and give up to boring when I have to clean up my room. For example when I have to clean up I always turn radio on in order to go along with my feeling and get through it.
