While thinking about my future I am optimistic and I think realistic enough. However who can say what is realistic for you and what is wishful thinking. If somebody had asked me even 5 years ago about my future I hardly would have been able to guess that I would be here. Very soon I will leave the US. I hope that when I live in England I will find an interesting well paid job related to art. However I will agree to work in any place such as a coffee shop or a restaurant unless I find the job I dream about in order to just practice my English and find new friends. I hope I will start to learn Spanish as soon as I speak English well . Because half of my husband's family is from Venezuela I need to know this language to communicate with them. I will need to get a driver's license because I want to be able to drive our car when we buy it. I think I will start to learn to drive by the time I work. In case I have some free time I will continue painting because I like it very much. After my husband gets his PhD we will come back to France. Once we arrive in France we will buy a big nice apartment in the center of Paris. Before we move to Paris we will have two children or maybe three and we will need enough place for our big family. Even if life in a big city has a lot of advantages every year we will spend several months in our small house in a rural area on the Mediterranean seaside which we will buy when our children will be born. It will be very good for the children when they breath the fresh air from the sea. Although I will be very busy with my family I hope I will have time for my own business an art salon with free art school for children. And for sure I will visit my family and friends in Russia and welcome them in my home however busy I am.
