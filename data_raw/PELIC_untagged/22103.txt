Language is definitely different between humans and the rest of the primates. Communication and use of language is more complex in humans but it doesn't mean that other primates can't communicate. During this unit we learned that primates can communicate between them and also with us in a more complex way that some humans imagine. They can learn sing language they can express feeling and even come up with new words.
