I graduated three years ago. Before I started attending to collage I'd been worrying for not handling the major that I chose. Therefore I had studied hard and tried to cover all required works. One day while I had been working on project on my computer I lost all the work and I had never saved a backup file. However I restarted the project again and the result was great.
