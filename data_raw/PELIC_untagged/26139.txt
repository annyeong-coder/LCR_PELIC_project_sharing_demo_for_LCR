I would like to do. First of all it is internationl festival. The festival compines artists from all over the world. Second it is amazing because of its richness variety and splendor. There are many copies of famous attractions such as Edo castle in Jaban the parthenon in greece. Also there are the most dramatic ice creations enormouse ice buildings and karaoke bar. It occures in the same time as the sapporo winter olympics. If someone doesn't have a passion or intrest in this kind of art it will be a very cold vocation.
