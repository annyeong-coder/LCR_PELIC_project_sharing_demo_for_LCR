Although people may say death penalty is needed in our society which involves lost of crimes and corruption I think it is an ambiguous perspective because there are a few articles indicate that death penalty is not the main reason to control or improve crime. In addition even criminals have right to live. Also prisoners sometimes give society help in different way. Furthermore look back our history there were a few innocent people who were executed because of wrongful judgement. Therefore we should ban death penalty to avoid this kind of situation. To sum up we need to reinforce judicial system to improve social education and to reduce unemployment to decrease criminal rate instead of using death penalty. Death penalty is paradoxical and exaggerated. Although people feel comfortable with it it does not help society be better or safe. All we need is as I mentioned enhancing judicial educational and financial systems not using death penalty which supposes useful but does not to create a pseudo peace pseudo peace world which is full of fear and teeth for teeth justice.
