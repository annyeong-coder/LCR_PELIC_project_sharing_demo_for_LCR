In my mind there is one word no one could ever define and no one knows why because happiness is a feeling which many simple things may bring about. Children can find their happiness in a new toys and sweets which could not cheer a younger heart longing to be beloved. For the person inside me being surrounded by an adored family having many trustful friends and feeling the accomplishment in life are the keys to my heart which make me feel glad to have such beautiful days in my lifetime. It is a grace to have an adored family who always stands by my side. They are here where nobody is around celebrating my finest moments telling me not to give up in my hardest times and standing behind to catch me when I fall down. Now how could not I be happy when I feel the spring in my heart Sharing a secret with a trustful friend has a unique taste of joy and cheerfulness. Not only sharing some secrets but sharing moments enjoyment sadness and even a bad day with my beloved friends can make my life full of beautiful events. It has taught me to give rather than to receive and the kindness of giving brings some happiness to a broken soul. Always strive to win another prize. Nothing can give me such a feeling like this sensation of self fulfillment. Accomplishment always has its reflections on anyone self confidence pride and appreciation all come together to strengthen the power within. It means a lot to me to proceed and to successes. In my belief happiness is not a beauty that you can see a song that you can hear or a sweet that you can taste. Happiness can only be inside a kind heart who appreciates the meaning of true love trust and pride. It is here and wherever you go.
