Dear Mr. ANON_NAME_0 I really appreciate that you presented for us at Hillman library last Friday. At that time I needed to search informations which I had to use in my argumentative essay. However I didn't know how to use that kind of program. Because of your helpful presentation I will be able to make my essay much better and also utilize it in another assignment. Thank you so much for your kindness again. I hope you to have a great day. Sincerely ANON_NAME_1 Last Name
