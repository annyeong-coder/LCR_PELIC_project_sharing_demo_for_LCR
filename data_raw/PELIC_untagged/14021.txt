If there is a time which I have flow it must be doing puzzle brainstorming things is very attractive to me. There is an example that I bought a 3000 pieces puzzle Empress Josephine from Louvre museum I spent seven nights to complete it. I stayed very late because of the mystery puzzle in which I was so interested time goes fast. Although doing puzzles does not have direct relation between creativity I felt satisfied when I completed them and I believe that it has an indirect influence to my part of creative brain brainstorming is the best activity to active your creation I have no doubt on it.
