My ideal house is an old building and has two floors and three large comfortable bedrooms and two large sunny living rooms and a small pretty kitchen. The building is located in such a beautiful residential area. It is very quite near the campus on a peaceful street. There is small garden in front of house so I can design the garden. I always plant some new kinds of flowers very quickly. When flowers is blooming in the morning early some flowers has a sweet smell. It is very well and my family lives in the house very happily.
