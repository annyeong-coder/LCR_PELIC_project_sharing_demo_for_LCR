Simple past and past progressive I met with one of my Turkish friend at the ELI English Language Institute's of the university of Pittsburgh couple days ago in front of the department of Linguistics. When we were talking to another friend she said Oh you are Turkish too. While we were talking to other friend she joined to our conversations. And of course I was surprised of meeting to that person by the coincidence. By the time we discussed about the ELI English Language Institutes' activities for a semester. And how the classes of the University of Pittsburgh has successful opportunities for their students. Then now we are glad to being friends. She said that I am absolutely grateful for taking classes at Linguistic department of the University of Pittsburgh .
