The theater to which I went on last Sunday was dirty and noisy. The audiences some of whom were bothering me were enjoying the new movie which is Inception. The girl who had a doll was playing in front of the theater therefore I was mad because the screen was blocked. Furthermore the man who was wearing red jacket was smoking. Could you believe it After the movie ended people some of whom left their trash there were noticed to pick up their trash and not to forget their own stuff. However nobody cared what they should do and why they had to do. I suggest that the manager must figure out this problem which is how they can keep the theater quiet and clean or they might lose audiences who really want to concentrate on the movies.
