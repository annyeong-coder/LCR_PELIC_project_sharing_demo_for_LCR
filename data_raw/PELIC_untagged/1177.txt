About 4 days ago ANON_NAME_0 was play soccer with my friends and his knee was twisted. Then he couldn't move his feet and we couldn't treat well. Of course ANON_NAME_0 shouldn't have to play hard because the injury that he has might be strong or dangros. Anyway we went to a hospital and the doctor said to him you shoudln't have to move your knee more and try to stay at home these days. In addition ANON_NAME_0 needs time to heal his knee.
