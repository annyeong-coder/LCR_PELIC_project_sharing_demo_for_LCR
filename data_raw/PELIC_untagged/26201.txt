First and foremost a lot of students are afraid when they have writing exam. For example when I see a plain white and someone tells me to fill it in a certain amount of time I get scared that I won't be perfect and I won't find the words that fit what I'm trying to explain.

You have to work hard and free yourself from fear to fly in your Imagination and write.
