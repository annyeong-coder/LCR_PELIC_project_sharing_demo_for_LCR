When I decided to go to desert island I might take matches because if I want to sleep I'll sllep on it. Also I may take a toothbrush to clean my teeth after eating if I want to. I must bring a knife to cut the meat and I have to take a flashlight to use at night. I could take a battery operated CD player to listen to music.
