I would give a new ELI student the following advice. First of all it is important to live in homestay. There are two reasons why I live in homestay. First you can eat American's food in their family. Second after you finished the class in the ELI you still have to speak English at home. This is really helpful to you. Next you must take care with ELI news. There are many activities and other important things to improve your English. Third In Pittsburgh is beautiful and friendly. You should visit the city and experience the lifestyle. For example I would like to see a musical a baseball game and annual festival. Fourth it is also important to make a habit about reading such as novel and magazine. It's helpful for writing. Finally there are a lot of available resources waiting for you.
