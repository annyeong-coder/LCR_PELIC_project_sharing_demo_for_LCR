I liked the book that I have been reading nowadays. The book can be found in self improvement sections of bookstores. Actually It is not like ordinary self improvement books. It helps the readers to get help of spirits who have been living around us since we were born. The book claims that we have been living with many spirits with whom we can contact and get help which sounds so utopia for me . However that is completely different approach in which I have been interested. I haven't run into before that kind of book that was recommended by my friend. The book says that a humankind whose needs never end have to want from his creator. This is the point which is wanting more and more until you get it. It says that if the creator doesn't want to give he doesn't create the feeling of wanting. It says that when you never stop wanting then you can get it by the spirits that are able to hear you and carry your wishes to your creator. That sounds like they are transporters. It seems like that I can make a correlation like that sounds like the substances that are needed inside human body. Like some places need those substances and the transporters are signaled by brain that gets the signal via something like hormones. I am still reading the book that tells things that are so extraordinary.
