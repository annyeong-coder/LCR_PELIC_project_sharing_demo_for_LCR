Today I saw a beautiful kitchen in a magazine. This kitchen has beautiful furniture and decoration. On the cabinets there are flowers and fruit and it does everything more colorful. The cabinet with sink is in the center of the kitchen. There are hanging lamps over the sink and it is efficient to wash the dishes. On the right of the kitchen there is a stove between cabinets. On the left of the kitchen there is a refrigerator and microwave. This kitchen is so perfect and I hope one day my own kitchen is like this.
