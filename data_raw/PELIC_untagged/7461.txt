Before I get married I had an important sweetheart who was my classmate in the university. I sometimes remember her but I never saw her after I got married. In my country generally women are extremely jealous. When I met my wife she wanted to know about my past experiences with women but I didn't explain my past. Therefore when my wife tries to talk about my ex girlfriends now I try to change the topic. I should have explained my experiences because events will be uncovered when the time comes.
