I moved to this house which I'm living now in Feb. My room was very messy. I threw away a lot of things were in the room. I cleaned it up and I hanged the mirror on the wall. Sometimes when I feel bored I straighten my room up or I use the internet. First website I visit usually Youtube. I pick out any song and listen to it. Then I look over my email. The internet is the best way to lose time. I lose much time on the internet in my room in USA.
