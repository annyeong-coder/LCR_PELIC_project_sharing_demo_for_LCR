My partner is Ricardo. He's ridden a horse three times. When he lived in Brasil he went to the park with his wife. He rode a horse there. He was excited. He's never climbed a mountain but he want to climb a mountain. He loves the nature. He's swum in a river. He swims very well. Brasil has lots of small rivers. When he was an elemantary school student he used to swim in a river. He's ever eaten Korean food. He told me that he has eaten Bibimbop at a Korean resaurant. He said Korean food was spicer than the Brasilian food but it was delicious. He's never sailed a boat for he thought it's dangerous. However if he can have a chance he wants to sail a boat.
