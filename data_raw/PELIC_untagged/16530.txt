I had a wonderful trip to Washington dc this last weekend but first I had something to do. First I had class in ELI and after that I had to picked my cousin up at the airport because she came to visit my dad and he wasn't available to pick her up at the airport. Second I had to clean the car because my mom told me I just could travel to see my boyfriend if I clean the car first so I did it. Then I did my baggage and separated all of my homework to do. At the Saturday morning I putted the gas checked the tiers and water in the radiator . Finally I drove 4 hours to get in Washington DC. When I got there I saw my boyfriend and I had a wonderful weekend with him.
