Before I moved here I had never driven car. When I moved here the women didn't drive car in my country. When I stayed in my country I had never learned the drive car. When the car broke I had never fixed it. Also when the fuel car finished I had never dictated the car fuel. I had never repaired it before. When I arrived here I had been trying to get driving license.
