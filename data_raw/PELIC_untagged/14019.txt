When I came from Saudi Arabia to study English in America here in Pittsburgh I was really shocked . I don't know why but maybe it was from the new society that I had to live in. Also there are many differences between my country and the U. S. A. But there are a few similarities. Saudi Arabia has a unique and different culture from the U. S. Almost in everything. Also when many Americans study or hear about the Saudi culture it will sound strange to them especially when they hear about the eating habits in Saudi Arabia. When we invite someone over to eat dinner in our homes we usually put the food on the floor and we use the right hand to eat. On another hand the people in the U. S. Usually put the food on the table and start eating by using knives and forks. Also the Saudis usually wear what we call the ''Thope'' it's made from fabric and it can be any type of fabric or color. We must wear it in specific places and at certain times for example if I'm going to visit my friend at his house in the mosque and at school. I can't wear anything that I want. However in the U. S. They usually wear suits for special events and jeans when they go to work. Saudi Arabia and the U. S. A are really rich countries because they have a lot of oil. Also Saudi Arabia is the number one producer of oil in the world. Also the U. S. A. Has preserved oil that they can use for the next 100 years. However the American dollar and the Saudi Rial always related. If the dollar goes up the Rial goes up also which means one depends on the other. On another hand the cost of living is almost the same in both countries which made it easier for me to become more familiar with this new life. Finally it was really difficult at the beginning to live in a different society and I had to deal with new people that have their own culture. But by in the time I got used to it .
