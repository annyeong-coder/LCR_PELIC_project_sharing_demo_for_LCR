Dear ANON_NAME_0 Here's what a typical day looks like for me. Even though getting up early in the morning is the hardest thing for me I get up at 9 00 every day. I show up at school around 9 50 10 00 but sometimes I was late for the class because I got on the wrong bus. Fortunately one of my friends gave me the bus schedule. So I finally found out what the bus no. And what time that I should get the bus stop. At school I have many friends. However we just have been friends not too long I'm pretty sure that I can count on them.
