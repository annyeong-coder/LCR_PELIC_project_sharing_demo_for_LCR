My apartment in Pittsburgh is very nice and spacious the biggest room is the livingroom. Every thing are oranized and the forniture are modern. On the back wall there are one big screen and near an heart the but it's doesn't working. In the corner of the leavingroom in frnt of of the television there are two confortable sofa and between on original table. Around the livingroom there are many pint also them are modern. When I'm seat down on my sofa and wathcing my televigion with my dolby sorraun on the left of the room there are 3 big widows long all the wall and duringh the sunny days the room is very bright. The floor isn't the best one in this modern flat the carper is a bed match. Only this last particulat is not the best one but in general this flat is very nice and I'm very luky that I can use fore some months. Student's Name
