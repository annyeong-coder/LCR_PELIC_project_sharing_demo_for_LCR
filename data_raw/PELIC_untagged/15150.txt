For many years I have had a hobby sewing of cloth. When I was 16 I accidentally have seen a fashion magazine where there were a lot of models of skirts blouses and dresses. In the magazine I have also seen patterns of all the clothes. I have decided to try to sew a skirt by myself. I have bought fabric and following the directions in the magazine I have made my first cloth. I was very interested in the sewing process. From that time it became my hobby. I sewed not very complicated models. Also I sewed something original for my friends.
