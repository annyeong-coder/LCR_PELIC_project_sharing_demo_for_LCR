My name is Jin hee and I am from Korea. I came here because I want to improve my English. I am still university student in Korea. Now I'm taking English course at Pit. I like Pgh very much. It's very clean and green. But these days I can't see green things because of snowing. I didn't know weather would be like this. Although it's very cold the scene is very pretty. My hobbies are watching movies and listening to music. I'm usually going to Waterfront to see movies. I'm planning on traveling to Europe after this semester. So nowadays I'm busy because I have to find some information about Europe. Sometimes it's hard to find information and makes me trouble but I'm still enjoying finding this.
