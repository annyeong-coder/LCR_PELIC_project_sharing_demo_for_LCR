Last week there was a snowstorm in the north east of the US. Although the snowstorm has gone we still should be careful. There are two protections for the dangers of a snowstorm. First of all it is crucial that you should prepare batteries or candles before a snowstorm. You may acknowledge that the electric may be cut down in some places because of a snowstorm. Without lights it's very inconvenient and unsafe when you are at home. Secondly if it is not necessary please do not go outside or drive. You may feel reluctant to stay at home for three days. However walking on the street in the snow may let you slip on the ice which means you may get hurt. Moreover when you drive in the snow the car may also slip and an accident may happen. In conclusion you can be safe during a snowstorm when you prepare completely and stay at home. The weather conditions are very ambiguous. Therefore we should eliminate the dangers of a snowstorm as many as we can.
