Many people like to take good items that others threw away so they can use and recycle those in other ways. In fact on the one hand they keep for themselves very valuable objects such as minks pianos or TVs on the other hand they give to the poor items that are still in good conditions. Besides being lucky these garbage hunters have good means of transportation and time to go around their neighborhoods.
