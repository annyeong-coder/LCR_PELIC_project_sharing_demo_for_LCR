Ann Cooper is the director of nutrition services for the Berkeley Unified School District talks about How to feed kids in America My thing with school lunch is it is a social justice issue she said. She made many researches about how Americans feed kids in schools. They eat unhealthy and not organic food which means they will be sick and die. Many meals in school have some chemicals and U. S allow to do that because there are many advertisements about unhealthy food in some magazines. Americans don't spend enough money to feed their children and they need to teach them about the difference between healthy and non healthy food because what they are what they eat. Also they should teach them if they continue eat unhealthy food which they are eating in school they will be sick and have less life. They need to change their manners about food and try to eat healthy food to avoid many diseases and live better.
