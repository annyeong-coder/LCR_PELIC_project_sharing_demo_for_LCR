Yes. I agree. For example Landfills are filling. Many country use incinerators but burning garbage is too bad for people and air which in many cases must be handled as hazardous material. We produce by using less packing and fewer disposable products reusing disposable packing and recycling. Finally to scrap trade is efficient for the global economy.
