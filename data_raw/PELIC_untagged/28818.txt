Having worked for an electricity company I chose to study engineering. I did not acknowledge what I want to study which was my biggest problem after high school. When I was in Alhusin bin ANON_NAME_0 high school which is near my house I did not find any one to direct me for a major that I like. Many of my friends who are in my class did not have any idea of what major do they want. What was crucial for them was to have a high grade then to choose a major. Having been in medical school my friend whose name is ANON_NAME_0 chose to be a doctor after he obtained a high grade in high school. In the other hand my friend ANON_NAME_1 who has low grade went took History as a major. So the philosophy at that time was your major depends on your score. Having finished high school I took business as my major. After two years of studying I realized that I do not like my major. So I stopped learning and searched for a job being my only option. Having worked for the electricity for six years I found that I want to be an engineer. Finally I quit from my job to pursue my education with new major which is engineering.
