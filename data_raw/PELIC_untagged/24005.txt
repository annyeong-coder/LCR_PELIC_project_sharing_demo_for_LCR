People grow up in different way have different personalities. Some people might grow up with their parents or grandparents and some people might be fostered. I believe that an environment in which children are raised can make them intelligent because children are influenced by the people who are around them and they can get more resources then peers. First of all the most important factor that affects children a lot is the people who are around them. No matter children are fostered or not they learned many things from the people who they get along with everyday. For example if a child is adopted by a couple and the couple are rational and intelligent the child will learn the attitudes from fosters and it is inevitable that the child will be more rational and intelligent. In the same way if your friends around you are inherently smart you might not as smart as your friends but you also learn how to be a smart person from them. The second reason that environment can affect people result in intelligence is the resources which the environment has. If children grow up in a stable family and their parents can sustain them various kind of studying resource like good education or professional teachers the children could enhance their abilities more effective and make the children more intelligent. In conclusion the environment's materials such as people around a child or the resources that the environment can provide will influence children a lot. The good genetics might also affect a person but I believe the environment is the most important reason.
