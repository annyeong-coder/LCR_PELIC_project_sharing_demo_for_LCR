Dear Mr. ANON_NAME_0 I am a student at the EFl Computer Training Institute. I have some advices for you Mr. ANON_NAME_0. First I think you should tell the students empty the trash when they finish from their assignments. And you ought to say to them don't move from this place before cleaning floor. You should speak with each student about this one. You should say to all teachers to check on the floor before the students move. You had better don't agree the food in the class. They ought to come to their classes on the time. Thank's Mimo
