I met the most important person in my life while I was studying last year in university. At that time I had already finished all 3 subjects in scriptwriting . It seemed like there was nothing did I have to study anymore. However I was strongly determined to study writing in further so I requested my university to look for excellent teacher to enhance my further writing skill. Eventually my advisor led her to my life. Sodsai Panthumkamol is the first person founding School of Theater in Thailand. For many years she had gained reputation as a perfect teacher moreover she had produced considerable artists for thai television and theater. Actually she retired her teaching for 10 years and I thought It might be my very best luck for me to have an opportunity to study with her. While I was learning playwriting with her I got a scriptwriting job also . It made me so pround of myself . However the work did finally not succeed and I gained ample terrible comments form my boss. That was a horrible part of my life. During I was blaming my self with guilty feelings my teacher came to me and consoled me with some percious words . She told me that she was not different from me. Although she was 70 years old and also had worked for many years but she still had many faults . No one was perfect she convinced me . During I was listening to her my egotism was gradually broken. From now on eventhough I have passed that moment for very long time her words always cling to my heart .
