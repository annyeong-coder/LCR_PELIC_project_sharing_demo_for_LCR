I will be happy if I received a gift of money. I do not know which I will choose right now. I think when I received a gift of money I would rather buy a piece of jewelry. I am going to tell you two things make me choose the jewelry it doesn't end and it doesn't miss its value. Jewelry doesn't end. I mean it still working as much as you want. It can live for many years without any problems. For example when my father married my mom he bought her a lot of jewelry that was 20 years ago but my mom still have it until now. A jewelry doesn't miss its value that means if buy it with 500 dollars after 5 years you can sell it with the same piece which you bought it with. So it is normal that I don't want to lose the money that I received. I think it is a good idea to keep it. Sometimes you have a problem. It might be financial problem. These jewelries will help you. You don't have to go to a bank or to your friends to loan money from. You have yours you can buy your jewelries and solve your problem. For these two reasons I prefer to buy a piece of jewelry rather than buy a ticket to attend an event. If I will I will lose my money. I mean after the event my money will be in the air. It is true that I will have a good time and I am going to enjoy my self but after all what will happen I will go back as what I was before I receive the gift. In the conclusion I hope that you understand my idea. And if you think it works try it out. I promise you will thank me.
