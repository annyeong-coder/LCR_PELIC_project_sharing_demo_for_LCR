I think every country in the wide world has problems. Today I am going to talk about a big problem in my country. The problem is a lot of people cannot find a job easily. There two solutions to solve this problem. First the workforce in my country is going up but the problem is how to find a job. The government can be the first resource to solve this problem. The government's role is to establish new companies especially in the south region because people from the south should move to the north to try to find a job. In this case the government will increase the opportunity to find a job. Second as you know if someone does not find a job that means he is poor. In my country the average of poor people is also going up. So the government should help people that want to establish their own business but they do not have enough money. In this case the government is going to be the finical support. In addition this people are going to give other people a chance to find a job. Third some people are illiterate. They do not have money to study or their parent cannot support them because they are poor or they do not have a good job. However the end of the career in Tunisia for old people is at the age of sixty. If it will be less for example at the age of fifty five it is helpful for young people to find a job easily and they can continue their education at the same time. In conclusion with establishing new companies help people financial and make the age of the end of career at the age of fifty five all this solutions can affect positively the problem of finding a job.
