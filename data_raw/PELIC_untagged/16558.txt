What I do everyday is boring. I wake up 8 45AM and take a shower. After I get ready to go to school I double check what I am missing for the classes. Before I take a bus I smoke. Next I take classes. Sometimes after school I play soccer with my friends or do my homework in the CL. When I get back to home I usually eat a dinner with my roommate. After then I do what I want to do in my free time. I am getting tired of doing same things everyday.
