One of the most interesting experience I have ever had with money happened 2 yeas ago when I was an investor in the stock market. I used my friend's investment account since he already had 2 accounts and he was not using this one anymore. So I used it for a while for selling and buying stocks after a while he started to use it with my by adding some money to the account. At the beginning he said he will only do some transactions then will stop but he ended up mixing our money. In top of that he started to use my money to buy some stock! We went in a fight for a while because the irresponsible action he has done until he paid me my money back after a while.
