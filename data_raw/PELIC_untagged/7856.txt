2 When I woke up the next morning I was surprised to find that I had overslept and would be late for work. As I rushed down the stairs to eat a quick breakfast I tripped over my cat and tumbled down the stairs. I spilled water on my presentation document. My ankle was sprained. However I had to go to work. After an awkward standing I went into the kitchen to find some coffee and bread but my fridge was deserted. I hadn't gone to grocery stores for a week. Finally I went out without any breakfast and hoped that I would arrive the office before the meeting time. 3 On my way to work I decided to take a shortcut through an old part of town. I had walked through that way until I saw a closed road. That road was in construction. There were many big holes and it was very dirty. I couldn't use that road anymore. I had to go back the same way and use the regular way. Finally I reached the office 1 hour late from the meeting time. I couldn't imagine what was going to happen to me in the office. 4 When I arrived at work I found a note on my desk from my boss. She wanted to see me right away. I took a deep breath and walked into her office. As I stepped inside I noticed a scowl on her face. She held a big folder in her arm. That was a folder for presentation today. When she saw me she was very angry and threw the folder on the ground. She angrily said that our business partners just left the office and they weren't interested in our products at all because of an irresponsible manager. I couldn't explain anything to her. I keep wondering what happened to my life.
