However a lot of people in the early 21st century in many countries as fewer people cook at home because they don't have time to cook in their homes. There are a lot of fast food in different restaurant as a breakfast or lunch and dinner also. For example bagels muffin and coffee in the morning and there are a lot of chicken and hamburger and beverages such as Pepsi coco cola.
