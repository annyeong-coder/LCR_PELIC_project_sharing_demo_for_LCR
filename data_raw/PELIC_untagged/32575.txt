If you were a billionaire would you donate half your fortune to charity The richest one percent of adults alone own forty percent of global assets. In contrast the bottom half of the world adult population own only one percent of global wealth. Wealthy people should distribute their money to poor people in the world in order to be social responsibility and moral responsibility. The superrich should carry out their responsibility toward the society by sharing their fortune with others. It is obvious that the superrich have earned their money through the society. For example they have sold their products to people to get money. Thus a part of their profits should be plowed back into the society in the form of donations to cultural facilities and the like. The wealthy should perform their moral accountability by donating their money to others. Needless to say with the moral point of view people should contribute to the society as a member of the society. The wealthy is the only people to contribute to the society by money and giving it back to the society is one of the best way to make the society change to the better. Therefore it is moral for the wealthy to use their money for others. Some people state that the superrich don't need to share their money with others because of their results of making their efforts to be success and rich. Somebody also maintain that the superrich have their right to spend their money enjoying their life. I understand that the superrich persons need entertainments and luxuries to make them enjoyable and fun in return for their efforts. However excessive dissipations of their money for themselves are regarded as uncommon behaviors. In addition they lead to their corruptions as humans. In conclusion the superrich people should share their profits for the common good from the social and moral points of views. I believe that such wealth circulating society is one of the best remedy for a lot of issues in the world.
