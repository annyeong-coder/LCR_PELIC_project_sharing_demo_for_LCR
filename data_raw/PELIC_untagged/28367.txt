I grew up in Kuwait which is near the Arabian Gulf. Kuwait's share their borders with two countries which are Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Kuwait's weather which is very hot is ranked as one of the top ten hottest countries. Kuwait's has a very small population which is approximately 1 million. Many Kuwaiti's like to play soccer which is a favorite hobby in Kuwait.
