It's only after 7 months that I quit my job to come to the US with my husband that I realized what determines a really good co worker. At first glance I am going to write about my co worker who is a role model for all other colleagues. Every day she starts 10 to 15 minutes earlier to prepare her computer and to check her calendar. Lisa is a very good looking person and underlines her appearance with appropriate elegant business dressing. But the most important thing is her excellent Know How in her field. No question is remained unanswered in a polite manner. Her person is known and appreciated from all our customers and co workers. On the other hand there is my colleague Petra. She is the worst person you can imagine to work with. I had worked with her for 15 years and at that time I had never met her on time in the office. When she shows up approximately 15 minutes late her appereance produces a kind of bad atmosphere. Everybody looks at her and wonders about her dressing style which is more for parties or nightclubs. Although we have a dressing code for our office. When she starts working it is her custom to apologize for another 15 minutes to do something private first which meant to call a family member or to chat with some other coworkers first. Petra was never updated with news from the office because she never went to meetings to inform herself about it. For the meetings she apologized for some private events. Therefore she could have never answered our customers questions and has had to ask all the times. Everybody has been annoyed of her questions which she asks impatienly and never mind to interrupt a conversation. I finally came to the decision to write down what I really appreciated on my co worker Lisa and what me annoyed over years of my colleague Petra. Unfortunately nobody has the courage to tell Lisa what great job she does and very unfortunately nobody tells Petra to work on herself and that she should change her annoying working style.
