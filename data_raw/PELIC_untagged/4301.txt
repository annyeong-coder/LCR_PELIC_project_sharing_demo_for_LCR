Learning English Journey Learning English is a long journey. Though Learning English is important to many people to help them communicate better the learning process requires a lot of effort and time. For example English was taught as a second language for all schools in my country starting from the seventh grade. Until now I consider my English level as intermediate and I need to learn more. I noticed that most of the ELI students have already had for more than six years of learning English before they came to the USA. They would like to expedite their English learning journey by learning it within a native English country. Moreover practicing listening speaking reading and writing intensively under supervision of expert English teachers has a superior impact in the learning journey.
