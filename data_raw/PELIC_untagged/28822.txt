When I was a child I have ever read a book named the road of Future which was written by Bill Gates who was the creator of Microsoft. In the ABSTRACT he told his readers that the computer technology was the development direction of human. In the next decade years computer would be the most CRUCIAL equipments in people's life. At that time a seed was planted in my heart. Although the description is AMBIGUOUS and I did not understand clearly why it was the future of human being I still have to acknowledge that I was attracted by it. Seven years ago when I applied to university the film Matrix revolution was very popular in China. I was shocked by the story which showed us a totally digital world. Being a hacker the idea generated from my brain and it pushed me into this major. On the other hand because of the success of Google Facebook Microsoft and other computer companies computer science was the hottest major in China. Only the students who got very high score in the national test which is as same as SAT in the US could got the admission from computer science department. With the PHILOSOPHY of being the best and dreaming to be a successful guy as Bill Gates I have believed computer science should be the best challenge for me. Another CRUCIAL element was that my parents wanted me to study in a major of science or engineering. They believed that these kinds of majors were easy to get the admissions from American universities and the truth proves that they were right. Bring me to the USA successfully my major is the most important element. So this is my reason to choose computer science as my major.
