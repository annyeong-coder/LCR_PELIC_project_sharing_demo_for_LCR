Pon ANON_NAME_0 is an island near Taiwan I went there with my classmates. That was my graduation travel. According to my experience I think it was the best place to go on a vacation. First of all we can do many water activiies there like snorkling and taking a boat they are very exciting. Second we can try some dishes which are their traditional foods the foods were made by local. Third there are also many good places in Pon ANON_NAME_0 we can see nature and strange stones if we go there we can feel relaxing. The most importantly there are firework fastival in summer vacation if we go there on July we can see fireworks there they are very wonderful because many pictures like animal and colors in the sky. According to these things I think the best vacation place is Pon ANON_NAME_0.
