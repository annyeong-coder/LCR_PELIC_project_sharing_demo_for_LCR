If I were able to travel to any country I would go to Indonesia. They have a great natural in addition the weather is rainy almost all year. I think it is a good place for relaxing. There are many islands some of them are famous by their beach like Bali. The standard of living is very cheap the hotels transportation and restaurants. I visited Indonesia before five years ago. If I were not busy in my studies I would be there right now. In fact when someone does not have much money he thinks about traveling to Indonesia.
