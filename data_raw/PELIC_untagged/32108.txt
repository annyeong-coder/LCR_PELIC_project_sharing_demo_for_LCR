In my view the online shopping is easy and fast and I have more than options for the things that I want to buy and I can buy it at any time also I do not think the online shopping it is wasteful I think shopping in a store costs more than online shopping but there is one thing in online shopping I do not like it which is I cannot touch the materials that I want to buy however pictures help sometimes. At the end actually I disagree with the author because the online shopping is not wasteful and you can save time and money and for me I like and I enjoy in both online shopping and store shopping.
