My name is Student's Name . I am living in Shadyside. I am interested in American culture especially the daily life of university students because I want to see whether it is the same as what is seen on television in Japan or not. I am always going to the supermarket Giant Eagle every day though I don't buy anything. I am interested in linguistics so I am studying English at the ELI but I am going to learn other languages as much as I can. Thank you.
