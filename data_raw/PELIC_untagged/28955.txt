Working in this wonderful hospital is my dream because of its newest equipment and the best consideration for their clients. People who want to be an occupational therapist must have nice personality to deal with their patients. I not only have passion in my work but also like to work with people. In addition I have worked in this area for three years. My good experiences will be helpful for my patients. Some people who don't suffer form serious diseases can still go to work from Monday to Friday. They would go to hospitals and do rehabilitation exercises on the weekend. All most therapists may be unwilling to work on their holidays however I would like to because I really enjoy doing my job and helping my patients. It is important that I have a better commutation skill than others because of 3years working. In order to talking with patients and their caregivers and planning an appropriate treatment having a good commutation skill is a principal citrate. Although there are suppose some people have longer working experiences than me I still keep studying after my works and also attending reeducation classes. In addition I don't have children who need to be cared so I can work on the weekend and even at night. This job is the best one that I want to apply. My passion and experiences are the significant factors that I recommend myself.
