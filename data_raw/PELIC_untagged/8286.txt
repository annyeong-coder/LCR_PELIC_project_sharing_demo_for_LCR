Dongchimi Kuksu Two years ago I've got the best meal I've ever had happened. I was returning to Seoul capital in Korea from Kangwondo located in the east area of Korea and has a lot of mountain after skiing with my coworkers. At that time it was huge snow so we were suffering from severe traffic jam. Therefore we escaped the highway and ran toward a small road. A few minutes later we found a tiny and shabby house served traditional Korean soup noodle. Because we were stuck on terrible traffic jam for several hours we were tired and hungry so we entered the house without any expectation. An old woman asked what we ordered so we ordered Dongchimi Kuksu. It is Korean traditional soup noodle. The noodle is made of wheat and the soup is made of beef stock. After putting the noodle in the boiling soup noodle and soup pour into a big bowl. If some cooked beef vegetable seaweed and some ice delicious Dongchimi Kusku is complete. After a few minutes when she brought dishes we were surprised because the bowls were so big that we thought we couldn't eat all of them. There was very thin and almost melting ice on the surface of the soup so the soup was cool. Even though we eat Dongchimi Kuksu at winter the best Dongchimi Kuksu has to be little frozen. As you can guess we ate all of them and even some friends ordered more other menus. I can't forget the Dongchimi Kuksu. It was the best Dongchimi Kuksu I had eaten. Also the house was very lovely despite of shabby place. When it comes winter I remind the small house and delicious Dongcimi Kuksu.
