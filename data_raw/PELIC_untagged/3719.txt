I think marriage is very important to both men and women. If you are not sure who is the best person to marry then don't do it. So I believe Betty SHOULDN'T marry to either David or James now. Before she agreed to marry David she OUGHT TO HAVE considered deeply. Otherwise before she wanted to start a new relationship with James she MIGHT HAVE KNOWN him well. Anyway marriage is not like playing a game Betty HAD BETTER MAKE the best decision as possible as she can.
