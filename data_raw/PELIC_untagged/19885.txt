It is little ambiguous topic to me. In terms of women's contribution in their family it is really important to have distinct responsibility. First unlike the states it is main duty for women to take care of their children during day time in my country. Second without special care by women for their children it is unlikely that one can expect their children to grow in a ordinary ways. Finally women can manage their home place even better than men. The importance of women in family is crucial.
