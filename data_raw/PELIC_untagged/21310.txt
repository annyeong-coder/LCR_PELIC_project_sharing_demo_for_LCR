I think some of research advances justify the use of animal testing. First sometime we need to know what we can do for curing many diseases so we need animal testing to see if this is a useful way. Second because we need to test something like cosmetics medicine or detergents are safe to use we also need animal testing to prove it. Finally although sometimes it is necessary to have animal testing we should have some group like PETA to watch researchers and avoid abusing animals. In my opinion animal testing is good for people but we also have to protect animals.
