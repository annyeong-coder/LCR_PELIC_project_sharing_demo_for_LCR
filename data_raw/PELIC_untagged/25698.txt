Flow is an abstract description that states the natural emergence of children's also adults' peak pleasure and creativity. Circumstances such as teachers parents and schools can cut out or foster the flow. I have been experiencing my son's flow. When my son was in his element school his math teacher encouraged him to participant varied competitions of math. The teacher believed that he had a developmental potentiality on math because he liked to resolve math questions from diverse ways. My son told me his math teacher was very humorous. When he was thirteen he has been in the U. S. His English was too bad to take regular classes. He was in ELI class. But he voluntarily asked to take Algebra 1. In a teacher parents meeting his teacher told me that she was surprised that my son did good job in the math even if he didn't understand English. My son told me that the teacher gave him big helps. He loves the teacher. My son was very confident to choose AP Calculus in his junior high school year. This is a two semester course. However after the first semester he felt frustrated. He complained that his teacher always had no time to answer his questions after class. His teacher told me that my son was not an organized student. I know they don't like each other. Right now my son announces that he will choose biochemistry or bioscience as his college major instead of math. I only met my son's chemistry teacher one time but I was impressed by her rich experienced. As the same as Teresa whose beloved teacher fostered her artistic creativity some of my son's teacher boosted his flows. Yet some teachers can be a killer who ends children's flow. I think the circumstances of learning are crucial for a learner.
