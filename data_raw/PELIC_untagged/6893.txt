Topic There has some advantage when you have pets. There are some advantages when you have a pet. First of all if you have a dog in your home sometimes he can help you to look after the house because when you aren't home he will bark at strangers who want to break into your house. Second it sometimes can stays with old men or women who live alone. They can let those old men and old women feel happy. Third if those pets have special training they also can help someone who is blind. When they live with those people someone who is disabled will feel safe and comfortable. Finally I think if one family has one pet this is good for them because pets can make us feel happy and they won't let us feel sad and lonely.
