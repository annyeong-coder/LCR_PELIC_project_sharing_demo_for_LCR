The most exciting thing that I have happened in Pittsburgh was the day when I was the Kennywood Park. It park is located the Southeast of Pittsburgh. The park had many attractions in specially a Ride Cycle It was very exciting Ride Cycle has a speed of 45 mph with a high of 65 feet it was stressful by three minutes. Other attractions very good were roller coasters there are specially fast and fun. I was in the park with Rob and 15 classmates all we had fun but were a little bit tired leaving the park. We left the park at 4 30.
