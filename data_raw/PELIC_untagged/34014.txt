Mary Hi Ann! How are you Could you have lunch with me I would like to talk to you. Ann Sure! I just have to send an e mail and than we can go. Mary Fine! Thank you! Ann What's going on Hoe can I help you Mary First let me explain the problem. So as you can see I'm very upset and that's why I have to talk to you. My son is consuming drugs. I'm so confused! I have no idea what I should do! Ann OH my dear! That's terrible! I'm so sorry but the life has to be continued. In this situation you must be a strong and smart person. Have you tried to speak with your son about that Mary I couldn't! Right now I feel confused and I don't know what I can tell him yet! I'm wondering if it might not be a useful advice. I'm aware that I have to figure out the best way and moment for the conversation. Ann I agree with you! If you are patient and profound it might work. Actually if I were you I wouldn't wait too much. That may be dangerous. I can't recommend you to do it today but you should talk to him as soon as possible. Time is money! It might be an old saying but in this case time can safe your son's life. From my perspective you should not put off speaking to your son. I know that you are able to that very well. You are stronger than you can imagine. Mary Thank you so much for doing me a favor. Your opinion is important for me. Currently I'm embarrassed and I'm not able to make a right decision you helped me a lot!
