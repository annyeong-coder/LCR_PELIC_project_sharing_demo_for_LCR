I can say Yes . In positive point of view the famous sport stars make even too much money and they should do less work than someone in a regular job. People who work in a regular job should spend all day working very hard and not get paid much even though super sports people make millions even when they aren't doing much. Footballers for example are good at what they do but do they really need to be paid as much money as they are receiving They're earning ridiculous amounts each week even when they are not training or playing. It's unfair that some people work harder than famous people and have to struggle with money issues though celebrities can just pick and choose whatever houses or cars they like with the millions that they have made just from one football match However before getting fame a lot of sport guy have to hard time to be sports star. This means that a few selected sport stars just make money among sports guy. In the sport business only winner have to be alive. Therefore it is not strange to get paid too much money for sport stars. I think the big money is result from their effort even though values of sport stars sometimes overestimate in the sport market.
