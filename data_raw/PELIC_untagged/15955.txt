The first step to have safe positive and efficient society is come from the home. I think family has critical role and obvious impact on rising up their children. Before fighting of crime I believe that we have to be aware about the crime avoiding factors. First of all children should have tranquility in their nuclear family. Second some children are touchy especially in schooling period. So parents should give them self confident and encourage them to react and communicate positively with surrounding community. On the other hand if the crime occurs we should treat it wisely and gradually. I think cooperation between cultured and experienced people in the social issues is good way to solve the problem rather than punishment. In my opinion ignorance of implications and causes of the crime will lead it to be complicated more and more while the punishment should be the last solution.
