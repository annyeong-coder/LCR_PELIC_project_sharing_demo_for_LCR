My soul mate is someone who helps me when I'm in trouble and also someone who doesn't spare him her self to do it. In addition I'm looking for someone who enjoys the same interests as me such as watching movies going shopping and trying to do new things. Of course I think that having respect and consideration for each other is an essential aspect too. If I'm not on the right track I hope that my soul mate leads me to the right direction. My soul mate who lives in Japan is a friend since we were in junior high school so we have known each other well for a long time. And also I know her family too. I think that having a soul mate whose family is nice would be an enjoyable state!
