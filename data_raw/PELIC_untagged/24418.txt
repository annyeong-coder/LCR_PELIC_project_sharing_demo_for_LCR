I have experience using different varieties of Spanish. When I was kid Maria Elena came to work at my parents' place. She was 21 had 5 kids a drunk husband and not a penny. She only spoke Poqomchi' one of the 21 Mayan languages that are spoken in Guatemala. When I met her she was illiterate spoke the basic Spanish's words and couldn't say a complete sentence. My friends complained that Maria Elena hung up the phone after a minute talking with her. They didn't understand that she was hanging up because they asked three or four times what she was saying. After two years of working for us she could understand everything my family said and we could pick any word she said. Even though we were kids my sister and I spoke a simple language with her. I remember that my sister wanted to show her what was a microwave and how to say the word. Maria Elena said that it was so difficult to remember and we named it the hot box . Maria Elena internal language was amazing she knew about nature more than anybody else in family. What I like most of Maria Elena is that she never learned the verb tenses and when time was going on I understood that she had a different concept of time. For her the time is circular and tenses apparently doesn't exist.
