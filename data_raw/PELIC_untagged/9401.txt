On December 24 2007 my brother in law was driving church with his eight month year old nephew my sister and me. He was in a traffic jam because of whirls of snow. However it's almost my nephew's usual nap time. So my brother in law decided to take my nephew with us home for his nap. Two minutes later on the drive home a man ran a stop sign while traveling at about 45 miles per hour and hit the car next ahead. I was deeply shocked by the accident. The car had been destroyed partly. I saw the driver whose car was wrecked. I saw the driver whose leg was broken. At that time the ambulance arrived to the place. The driver who was the car next ahead was taken to the ambulance. The driver who caused that crash was talking on his cell phone when he ran the stop sign and crashed into the car that the driver of the car next ahead was in. If I were a judge who had to decide consequences for the driver who caused that crash what punishment if any would I give him In my opinion the driver should have been sent to the jail as soon as possible. And I think drivers should be prohibited from talking on their cell phones while driving everywhere. I think I will try to drive slowly without using the cell phone when I drive. If I do not some of my misunderstandings and mistakes will be connected with the accidents.
