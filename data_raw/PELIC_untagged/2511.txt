I will go an uninhabited island. There will be nobody there. So I will enjoy vacation alone. First I will plant cotton. When it grows I will make a futon bad. When I have a bad I will be able to sleep because I usually didn't have enough sleep. And next I will have rests plentifully that I will walk or do exercise for a motion physical strength When In the morning the temperature is low. Also I will read the many books during that time that I am on the island . And I won't need hotel accommodation. I will just bring the tent. Maybe there is very worm. Also I will eat vegetable everyday so I will be on a diet. Finally I will enjoy my life there.
