I have been building this website for two months and I 'm almost finished. I have written this page to find new friends who live different country. First of all I want to say I have been working a lot for my website. Then I have written about myself. I grew up in Bursa Turkey but I have been living in the U. S. A since 2007. I have arrived at Pittsburgh in this winter. The weather was very cold. You don't want to be here in winter . When I came Pittsburgh I didn't know what I do. Then I decided to go to the Eli and I have been studying English for 9 months. I haven't still get Tofel . After I get Tofel I will apply to Chatham University for study math. I really like Pittsburgh. I have taken very kinds of photos about Pittsburgh. If you are interested in my photos please click my space.
