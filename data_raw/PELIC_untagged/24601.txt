I think I have to take matches because with them I can start fire with the objective to be warm and cook food. Another thing I must take is a knife since I think that is absolutely necessary if I want to survive in a desert island not only because I can kill animals but also I am able to cut things. In addition I have got to take a solar powered computer which could help me to be in contact with the world and may be could help me if I am in trouble so definitely I should take it.
