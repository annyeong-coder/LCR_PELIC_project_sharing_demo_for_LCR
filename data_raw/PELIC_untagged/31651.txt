Cell Phones in the Classroom Cell phone is a great invention that is affecting our daily life. Most people can not go anywhere without their cell phones because they think that it is important to have them to use in any emergency situation and or to have access to their emails from any where they are in. Cell phones are prohibited in many places like doctor's offices and movie theaters but not yet in classrooms. Although cell phones use in classrooms is allowed in many schools I believe that classrooms is not the place where students could use their cell phones. Cell phones used in classroom not only disturbing the students who use it but also it disturbs other students and the teacher. Schools should impose new rules to prohibit cell phones use in classrooms in order to give students more time to study instead of playing with a device. Some people think that it is crucial for students to use their cell phones in class in some cases I believe that it is only the matter of entertainment rather than emergency. In conclusion Cell phones use in classrooms is worsening to the fact that classrooms are the place for studying and teaching. I recommend that schools must prohibit cell phones use inside classrooms.
