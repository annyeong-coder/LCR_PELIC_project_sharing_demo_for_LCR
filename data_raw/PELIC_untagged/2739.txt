Definition of Success I feel that I have never succeeded in my life. The dictionary definition of success is the accomplishment of an aim or the attainment of fame wealth or social status. In my case what I earned a nursing certification and was promoted to chief nurse might apply to the definition. Indeed my friends said that I had had some successes in my career which I can not accept they were. I think that there appears to be a difference between their definition of success and mine. What makes the difference A nurse one of my colleagues said that it was one of successes to be a nurse. Another colleague enviously said that I already had a success since I had climbed to a higher position that is post of the chief nurse. They considered a step of my experiences as a success although I don't think so. I thought that this difference came from different sense of value. My friends must derive a feeling of satisfaction from being a nurse or a chief nurse. For instance we sometimes feel that a Hollywood star is a successful person. However he or she might not feel that he or she is a success. There is a different sense of value in there. A different sense of value makes for different definitions of success. I have realized that the difference is whether or not someone thinks small successes as a success. It is the fact that accumulating a lot of small successes would lead to a big success and a big success would be achieved only by accumulating a lot of small successes. One can not define success of somebody else. Definition of success should be defined by oneself. Do you want to call your small success as a success It depends on how you manage your way of life.
