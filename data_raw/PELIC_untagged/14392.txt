My Grandmother's House. My grandmother who lived in ALHASA had a big house. The kitchen is the place where I used to play. But my aunt whose apartment close to ours now used to punish me. So sometimes I had to play in the garden which was behind the house with my sister. I don't know the day when I slept with my grandmother but it was the best day in my childhood.
