MY SOUL MATE I'm looking for someone who would be at first my best friend. I would like someone that would be so close so linked to me something like a deep and natural affinity. It's not easy to explain it's just like such a great feeling of a natural fit a meeting of mind and soul. I'd like him to be compatible with me. That should be in the same games the same hobbies the same interests. He must be good in some fields which are Mathematics Philosophy and Geopolitics. I would like him to share my hopes and dreams for example we both must think that the world should be better. He must be open minded and knows that being tolerant to other cultures and other ways of thinking are the most important things in life. He should understand me perfectly and completely accept who I' am with no judgments.
