The beach was crowded while some people were walking on the water's edge some guys were playing volleyball some children were participating in a game of hide and seek other guys were under the rays of the sun. Also there were two dogs who played tag. We arrived at 1 00 pm and I put myself under an umbrella to sleep for an hour. It was impossible because with people's voices the radio of the boy near me and the dogs' barks I didn't get to sleep. So I decided to buy an ice cream. While I was appreciating my delicious chocolate and strawberry ice cream I started to walk with the feet in the water and during the walk I founded a lot of tellins shells and similar objects. When I went back to my friends who had stayed under their umbrellas we decided to have dinner on the beach. So we lighted a bonfire and then while the girls were drinking some pops the boys were cooking some shish kebabs of meat and vegetables. We were the only ones on the beach. The atmosphere was surreal no voices no dins of the crowd there was only the crackling of the fire the smell of the meat and the sounds of our guitars which brightened the night. When we finished eating and the bonfire was extinguished we waited some minutes to enjoy the pleasant moment the smell of the sand the smell of the sea and the sloshing of the waves will stay in our memories for a long time.
