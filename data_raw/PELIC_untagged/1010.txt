Oct 16 2006 Dear Mom It has been six months since I moved here. I think I am getting accustomed to living in the USA. By the way I am thinking about a cell phone which I should continue to use a Japanese cell phone or I should buy an American cell phone. An American cell phone is different from a Japanese cell phone in several ways. First an American cell phone is bigger and heaver than a Japanese cell phone so I feel that a Japanese cell phone is convenience to carry in my bag. Next an American cell phone has fewer features than a Japanese cell phone. You know that a Japanese cell phone has a camera feature a long e mail feature and a TV with a cell phone. However I usually don't use these feature now even though these features are useful for me when I lived in Japan because I bring my camera anytime and anywhere to take a lot of rare something I've never seen. Finally an American cell phone is cheaper than a Japanese cell phone. I don't need to pay money to converse with my husband. I think I'd better use an American cell phone in America. Would you mind suggesting to me about a cell phone next letter You must help me. I am looking forward to getting your letter. It's getting colder now. I hope that you will enjoy in your life.
