It is not a good idea to meet somebody through internet dating. First of all it is risk to meet someone that you do not know well. They may do something bad or dangerous to you. In addition they may disappoint you if they did not disclose vivid information. Finally it wastes your time because you can use this time to do something useful than attentively wait or go to meet someone who you have never seen. For these reasons I think you should not be too optimistic about internet dating.
