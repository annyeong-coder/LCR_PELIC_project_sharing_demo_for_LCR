When I was in my country I used to get up at 6 30 AM. Because I used to go to my job at 7 30. I used to eat lunch in my houes. Also I used to make around at the farm. In addititon I used to spend sometime with my family. Finaly. I didn't use to spend a lot of time on the computer. I have been lived in U. S since April 2008. I don't get up early. I get to the class at 9 30 AM. Also I eat lunch in the restaurant. I talk with my family on the phon. In addition I spend a lot of time on the computer. I do my homework and I contact with my friends on the internet.
