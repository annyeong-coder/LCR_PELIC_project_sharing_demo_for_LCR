Last weekend I went to Lowes Theater in the Waterfront to see a movie called Valentine's Day. This movie directed by Garry Marshall is talking about a love story. The main actor called Reed owns a flower store. The whole story describes something happening on the Valentine's Day. I think this is a chick flick designed to appeal to female target audiences. Although there are some sections ridiculous and unreasonable this film still attracts lots couples. For example after Reed's girlfriend Morley politely declined his proposal of marriage he was upset. In the mean time he suddenly found that maybe the right girl in his life is his best friend Julia. Why did his sad feeling only last less than one hour He must not love his ex girlfriend so much. However there is a happy ending in that movie. Most people had a good mood when they went out the movie theater.
