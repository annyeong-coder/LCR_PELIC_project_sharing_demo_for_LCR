If I choose any time period like past present or future I would choose future because of curiousness. First of all I am really curious about development of science. People who live in future further about 500 years maybe live different ways from nowadays. They will travel around the galaxy people will survive longer than today and alternative energy will not make any pollution. Therefore I want to see how much improve. In addition I want to see my descendant. I wonder whether or not they consider me good ancestor. Also I am curious what they live and what they love. Finally the last curiousness is my town. I like my house my school and the scenery of the city. However it is questionable whether it will keep or vanish. As I mentioned above I really curious about future life. If I can live in future I want to see improvement of science my descendant and my town.
