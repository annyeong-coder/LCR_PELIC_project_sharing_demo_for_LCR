The first step to interpret your dream is to determine what type of dream you are dealing with. Those dreams that generate from within your physical body and mind are for your functioning and survival in the physical nature. Other dreams that come from your spirit guides or tutors are for your spiritual development and progress. Your subconscious does know more than yourself.
