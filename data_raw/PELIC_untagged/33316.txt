Today Iam going to talk about my story with american family. I had an interesting experience about how to cook kabsa. I had never cooked kabsa before I came to the United States. This story happened two months ago. When I started cooking I Followed all instructions of cooking well. Afterward I invited all the family to eat with me but I surprised because I Forgot the salt and the kabsa was bitter. I had never seen like this before and I was embarrassed. I apologized to all and brought food from restaurant. It was terrible day .
