Hello I'm Yod. I come from Thailand. I've lived in Pittsburgh about 3 months. Before I came here I lived in Florida for 10 months. I studied English overthere for 2 semesters. When I was a student at the UNF. It was so much fun. I had so many international friends. We hung out together lots of time. Moreover we had crazy parties all the time as a result that my English wasn't got better by the way it could be. Now at the ELI of The University of pittsbugh. I've studied the same thing about the gramma that I had learned at UNF for about 1 months but I haven't got over my gramma problems yet. So I had set up my new goal before I started this writting. I'll be a good student. I'll take the classes seriously. I'll pay more attention in classes. I'll do what I've never done in school before.
