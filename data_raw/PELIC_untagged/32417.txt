Since I got here I received many telemarketings' calls which I am not used to before I came to USA. At first when they ask me if I'm interesting I say yes go on because I felt embarrassed to put them down. However they kept call me all the times. One time they woke me up early in the morning which made me angry so I hang up on them. Now I am definitely going to sign up for the Do Not Call list to stop calling me. Otherwise I will give up and I will throw out my phone to live peaceful and healthy life.
