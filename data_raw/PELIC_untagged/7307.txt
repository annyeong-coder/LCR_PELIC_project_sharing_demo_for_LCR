I have already traveled to America. I have enjoyed there especially in Pittsburgh. I went to a lot of museum and parks. In New York City I visited Niagara Falls. It is one of the amazing sightseeing there. In Washington DC I liked the architectures but I have never climbed Ice Mountains. I have never gone to China. I would like to visit the Grate Wall. I love to learn their costumes and cultures. I have always liked to cross china to Japan on motorcycle.
