Hi everyone ! I was born and grew up in Krabi a beautiful small town in Thailand. My family played a lot of kind of sports. My father is tennis swimming kayaking rugby coach. I have been playing tennis approximate 20 years. I got scholarship from Thammasat University. I don't know that I love tennis or not but one thing that I can tell you that tennis is a part of my life. I also love American football It is not famous in Thailand. When I tell my friends that I love American football they stunned because they know nothing about it. And now I'm in Pittsburgh which have the best football team and I'm beginning to fall in love with ice hockey Pittsburgh Penguin. Let's go PEN !!! Anyway I wanna try adventure sport so I planned to do skydiving with 3 of my friends on this August. My hobbies are shopping singing and traveling. My friends told me shopping should be my middle name ! I got here about 2 months but I went to Prime Outlet Grove City for 4 times !! Only on May I went there 3 times. And when I was an undergraduate student. I was soprano in my university chorus. On 2006 I was in California for 3 months. I worked in Sequoia National Park. It was a great time in my life. It's 3 years already that I went there but it seem like yesterday for me. On 2007 I traveled in Hanoi Vietnam with 1 of my friends for 7 days. I made a lot of friends. And we still keep in touch until now. 2009 On the way to USA I had connection flight in Tokyo Japan. I visited my close friends in Tokyo for 7 days. Tokyo is awesome !!! When you think about Tokyo you might think about technology animations games but they also have a beautiful park in center of Tokyo Big fish market a lot of temples. You can feel modernity and serenity in the same time. Well that's all about myself. Have a nice day
