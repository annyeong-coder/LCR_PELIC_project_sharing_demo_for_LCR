My favorite book is Robinson Crusoe which I read almost three times. Robinson who is the protagonist of this book was in an accident of sea. Although he survived he came to an island which had nobody live in. I learned many things from this book like how to save yourself when you are in danger and how to adjust yourself when you are in a bad situation. It is important that you need make yourself calm down when something bad happen.
