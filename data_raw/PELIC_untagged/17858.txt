Variety is the Spice of Life Have you ever seen the movie Yes Man It is my favorite movie. The main role Carl always said YES. Finally he changed his life. So was I. First law was my major. My job was a restaurant manager. Maybe you can get a lot of money being a lawyer. However I loved having contact with people and I liked seeing the people's smiles from my service. Everyone liked me. One day I thought about studying English. Now I am in Pittsburgh. I can make friends from different nation I can become aware of different countries' cultures. There are many surprises in my every day . Variety is the spice of life. Changes enrich my life.
