When I go to the Giant eagle Wal mart and Costco somewhere like grocery shop I usually buy that I didn't expect to buy things. I don't know the reason. I think fragrance influence to me. When I walked a bakery section that smell likely very delicious so I was being led by the nose. I think it's not tricky to fake a customer. Because the store owner's just spread an odor in the air. It is slightly effort but the effect made for a customer walked into a trap. The second thing that affect my purchasing decision is a sales clerk's speech. While I can't decide which one choose if a sales clerk say this is final sale. Or this one is the last one. I will being led by the nose from their speech. It makes very entice to me. So sometimes I avoid them. However they're trying to persuade me buy something but if I don't like the design I never buy that things.
