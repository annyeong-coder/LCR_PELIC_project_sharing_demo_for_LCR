Hi my name is ANON_NAME_0. I've written this page to present my self. I grew up in Riyadh and I've got my bachelor degree in law and political science. These days I'm in the stats especially in Pittsburgh. I've been living in Pittsburgh for 6 month. Pittsburgh is a beautiful city and in Pittsburgh they have the famous football team the Steelers. I've been studying English as a second language since I came to Pittsburgh. I usually woke up at 6 o'clock in the morning to enjoy watching the sunrise. I like to start my day with a cup of coffee and check my emails. I often spend my free time reading a book or watching movie.
