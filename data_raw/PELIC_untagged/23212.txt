My room was always gleaming! I used to live with my brother when I was in Saudi Arabia. We straightened the room up. It cheered me up when I arrived from school because I really liked to study and stay in great atmosphere. Therefore it made me more comfortable. When I took a nap my brother turned on his favorite play which is Xbox and he turned the volume down because I was going to sleep also he did not want to bother me and then I woke up and I saw the landscape of my room was very sad because he was acting up with my young sister during sleeping. Consequently I imposed him to clean up the room with me. We took away all the things that he brought from toys room this was special room made for him to put away anything. After that I studied for 4 hours and he was studying in our living room. And then I led him in the room. I did not use to count on my brother of cleaning the room but he was procrastinated. He did not use to do everything at the required time.
