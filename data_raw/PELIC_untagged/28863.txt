You ought to think more carefully. You have a great job now and you don't need to change your job. I understand your mind but you have only been going out for 4 months and you are not sure whether he loves you or not. If you really want to be with him you had better talk to him what you think. If he truly loves you he might not want you to change your job because of him. Also he could move to your country for you. You should not jump to conclusions.
