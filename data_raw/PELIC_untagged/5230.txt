Searching for the articles related to your subject is easy when you follow these instructions. First you type your topic in box on the computer screen and press the return key then the computer searches its database of magazines and journals and will give you a list of all the articles related to your topic. Next you can choose which ones you want look up and print out the list of citations. If you want to find recent ones just look up the dates of the articles. In addition this program gives you a brief summary of the main points of the article when you click on the box that says abstract. Finally the magazines and journals are in the periodical section on the second floor. You can't take them out but there are several copy machines in that area so you can make a copy of any of the articles.
