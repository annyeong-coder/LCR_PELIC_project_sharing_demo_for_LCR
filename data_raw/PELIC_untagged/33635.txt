The fable of the dove and the ant talks us that some we think it's just a cinch to help others but it will really benefit ourselves. For a example when I was a undergraduate I ususlly helped my senior. We usually talk over his thesis together. And then when I needed to do my final report he came back to our college and helped me by giving me some advise. To sum up then helping others is also a good thing for us.
