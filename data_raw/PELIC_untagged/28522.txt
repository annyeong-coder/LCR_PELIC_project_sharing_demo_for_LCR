When I was 10 years old my family moved to a new house. Then I got a first my own room which placed second floor in the house. In my room there was a bed which I slept in. To the right of the bed there was a window through which I can see my town because my house locate on the hill. There was also a big closet which was built in wall in where I used to sleep to hide from my family after when I fight with my father whose room located next to my room.
