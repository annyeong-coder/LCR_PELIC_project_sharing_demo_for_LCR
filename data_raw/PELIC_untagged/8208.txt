I had gotten my driver's license before I came to America. Before I got my driver's license I had been going to driver training class for a month. At first time I was afraid of driving a car because it is bigger than a motorcycle. I had considered giving up before I got the license. But after few days I had overcome the fear. I had practiced a lot and more familiar of driving a car. I had practiced driving on the road before I got my license. Finally I got a good grade for my road test and got my driver's license successfully.
