I have had several conversation with telemarketing on the phone He called me from blocked number then he talk me to giving him my visa card number. He tried desperately to convince me to give him the card information. Then he said hold on please to talk with my manager to make sure we are a trustful company. I was trying politely I'm not interested but he tried to convince me not to get of the phone. His manager was just like him. I decided finally to hang up the phone.
