Summer is my favorite season so hope all time is summer because I have an amazing and enjoyable time. There are several different main reasons why I love summer season I can do many activities and the weather is wonderful and great and I can eat fresh food. Frist of all In the summer season often my friends and I have many activities to do very weekend. We always go to out such as park beach and shopping. For example Last three weeks we went to Nore park in Pittsburgh we played some sports there suach as footble and soccer and we had BBQ. So we had an amazing time there. Onther example in last two months we went to beach and we swom there. Also I can travel anyway I want such as some of my family and I usualy have treaved Second of all the weather in the swmer is very wonderful and great to have fresh air and that is very healthy for my body. . For instance when I free time I often go out and walk becasue that makes me have a good time and relxing me. Fainlly I am helthy so I love eating fresh food. So when I was in my counrty in summer season I went to my family farom very day becasue it is a big farm and I can eat any fresh food I want and it is very for me suah as date poine and monge. So I think the summer reason is an excellent reason for these reaons and also I do not need wear many clothes.
