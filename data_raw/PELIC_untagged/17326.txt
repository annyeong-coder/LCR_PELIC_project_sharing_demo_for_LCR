I am still staying in the dorm I haven't found an apartment yet. Actually I paid the summer session's fee so I will stay in the dorm until the ending of this session. When I came here I had never done my homework using online submission system. When I was in the Istanbul University Faculty of Law I have been doing my homework by typing or hand writing. Speaking English on the phone isn't a new thing for me I had lost of English conversations before.
