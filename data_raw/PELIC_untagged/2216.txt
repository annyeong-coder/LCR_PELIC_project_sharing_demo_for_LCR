IndentWhen I was eight years old I got my first lesson to face the mistake bravely and solve it. As a birthday gift a bike was my best present from my father. I had anticipated it for several months because most of my friends had already had one and riding the bike made them very cool. I was jealous my friend so much. So when my wish became true I picked my new bike to the street immediately even I hadn't studied how to ride yet. I sat the site and my friends pushed my bike in the slope. I completely believed the slope could help me ride the bike quickly and I did. I felt wonderfully about the speed and the wind. My friends applauded for me and I heard the acclaim from my friends. At that time I really forget who I was and forgot I wasn't able to ride the bike. Unfortunately an old man who is holding his walking stick crossed the street when I was so proud by myself. If I knew how to ride I could stop my car quickly or turn to the other way. However I didn't know that and my mind was blank. The bike broke the old man directly. When the old saw me he didn't have a place to hide. We both fell down the street. Run away! Run away! The only words was coming my mind. I dragged my bike and fled the crash. I didn't recognize that he was my father's friends. When I went back home I hid this secret. Several days later my father met his friends who I collided. My father had given me a chance told him the collision but I had denied. Finally my father had me realize my fault and made an apology for his friends. I must write a letter also I was forbidden to ride the bike for one month as a warning. I will never forget that. When I do something wrong I know how to deal with will be the best.
