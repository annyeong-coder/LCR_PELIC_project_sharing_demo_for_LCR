I have a lot of things to do this weekend. First I have an English test in Saturday morning. After that I will go to the gym to exercise. In the night I will go to my friend house because he invited me for dinner. In Sunday my friends and I will go to Manorville Mall for shopping. In addition we are planning to watch a movie in the theater. Finally I hope every thing will be as planned.
