When the weather turned to the summer my husband and I had picked up a screen door from the Home Deposit store. We fixed it up to keep the mosquito away from our house. I put all my winter clothes away and put my skirts back to my wardrobe. We also turned off the heater and cleaned up all the windows. I decided to buy a new sun cream because the old one was used up in the last summer. All of these cheered me up because I prefer summer to winter in Pittsburgh.
