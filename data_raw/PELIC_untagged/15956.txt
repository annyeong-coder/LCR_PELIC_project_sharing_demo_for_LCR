In my opinion marrying someone of a different religion is not a good idea. Two different culture tradition and taboos cause cultural conflict. People from two different cultures is very difficult agrement. I have a very good example of this situation. My friend got married with foreign and they are divorse because they have different life style. Her understanding marriage is different.
