The best way to solve Higgins' problem is to cooperate with business partners. He has some problems that are associated with money. His problems were that he didn't do much advertising and offered bad quality food to customers due to not having enough money. Also the foods' price is expensive to students. He should be guaranteed finance to solve the problems. If he cooperates with others Higgins and his business partners have to distribute a profit. However the business partners can solve his financial problem. If he has enough finance he should hire a professional chief because the most important thing in a restaurant is the taste of the food. Also he should drop the foods' price. This is because his restaurant is located at Benson University so his main customers are students at the university. Lower prices and good taste are very important to students in their lunch time. Then many students will prefer to go Higgins' restaurant in their lunch time due to the lower price and good quality food making him a great success in his business with his partners without having to advertise.
