Everyone must have experienced an unusual phone call. For me one day in the morning a call woke me up. I picked up the receiver and answered the call. Someone was asking about someone els I did not know. I just replied that he is wrong but he insisted he is calling the right number. I first thought he is a liar. It was really frustrating at time that he kept on asking about that person. I tried to talk him into the wrong number. When I figured out he is just wasting my time I told him not to call me back but he seemed he never cares. Finally I put down the receiver and rang off.
