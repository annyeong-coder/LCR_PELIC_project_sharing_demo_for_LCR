Seoul where I grew up is a capital of South Korea. My house had a big garden which my mother cultivated plants in. At that time I usually played with my neighbors who I went to elementary school with. I used to go to the video game room which made my father angry. My father scolded me many times for going to the video game room. A bank in which my father worked was very close to my house. That is why I had visited the bank to meet him. My two older sisters got married and my parents who retired from a bank have stayed at home. I wish I had a good time when my family gets together.
