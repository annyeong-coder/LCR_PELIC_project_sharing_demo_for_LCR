C. English is not an instrument of cultural imperialism. Nowadays English has been spoken all over the world. When they can speak English as well as their mother tongue they can make communication easily. So I agree that English is one of the most useful languages. However English can not be an instrument of cultural imperialism. The reason why I say so is people do not want give up their own languages. In my case there are a lot of beautiful Japanese words which we cannot translate to English. There are 50 Japanese alphabets and another type one which has also 50 alphabets besides we use more than 4500 Chinese letters. As we Japanese use more than 4600 letters in our life only 26 alphabets can not substitute for Japanese. For example there are 20 words referring to rain in Japan because we have a lot of rainy days. On the other hand there are many words referring to meat in German. Languages has been reflected in the culture for a long time therefore English cannot substitute for other languages no matter how many people speak it. Not only English but other languages cannot substitute for even minor mother tongue because language is the base of its culture and the very thing.
