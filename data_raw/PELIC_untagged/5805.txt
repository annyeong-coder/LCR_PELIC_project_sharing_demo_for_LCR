Meng Yue had a difficult childhood. She grew up in a low income family. When she was 2 she suffered from an illness. As the result of the illness toward the beginning of her life she lost the ability to walk or stand. For a long time she couldn't study anything. She then got treated and after she finished the treatment she was able to study foreign languages. Now she can speak foreign languages but she still can't walk. In 1990 she was able to win the first prize in a contest of the foreign languages. By the time she was 18 she could write and read foreign languages very well. Now she can speak and write five different kinds of foreign languages. Being able to write is important to her and she told us she will be able to write a book next year. I think she likes to write until the end of her life.
