The senior citizen population in Korea is growing up very fast. According to the graph there was a slow rise in the senior citizen population from 1970 to 2000. However there was a drastic increase after 2000. In addition the graph indicates that the senior citizen population will be a steady rise in the future. Also the graph shows us that this is time of an aging society. Then an aging society is expected to have influence extending over the economy. We should get ready for an aging society. However we also can interpret from the graph that we aren't preparing for it yet. In the graph a sustenance allowance for senior citizens from the government remains unchanged after 1970. In addition there is a very very slow increase. It may cause a big problem in the future. First of all the gap between increasing of the old people population and the supporting of the government for the old people badly affects a general society. Because of the old people who need welfare and medical expenses will continuously increase but the government doesn't have solutions for it. Next these days the younger people don't want to live with the old people so many old peoples are being left out in indifference of society. In addition It will go from bad to worse in the future. Now the government has to make long term care insurance and to prepare for the social influence by the growing elderly population.
