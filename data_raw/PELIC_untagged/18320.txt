Some people may wonder why there is a scar on my eyebrow and nose. Let me tell the story. I was about 6 years old and we were in our summer house which is in Black Sea coast in north Turkey . The weather was warm but the rain have just stopped and everywhere was wet. But childhood. . My friends whom I still get along with them invited me to play outside. My mother who has strongly 6th sense didn't want me to go out and play. She said everywhere was wet and I could fall down if I run. But I didn't pay attention to her and went out to play in front of my house. My friends whose mothers are also my mother's friends both started to run. I was running too. But suddenly I falled down. My eyebrow nose lip had hurt so bad and also was bleeding. The pain which I had was intolerable. The day when I didn't pay attention to my mom I still can't forget. I should have listened to her. If I would I wouldn't have had these scars on my face.
