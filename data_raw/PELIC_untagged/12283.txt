When I was in elementary school I really liked reading a lot of books and wrote down my feelings about them. One day my mother bought me three new books. I was very happy and began reading immediately. I concentrated in my books and writing my feelings. Four hours later I finished all of them and also came up with a lot of interesting. After that my mother told me that she had asked me to have dinner three times but I didn't hear at all. I think I was in a flow at that time which made me get a lot of new ideas about my books.
