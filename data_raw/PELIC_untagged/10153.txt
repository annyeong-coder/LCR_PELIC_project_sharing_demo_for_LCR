The most interesting experience I have ever had with tipping was around 7months ago when I arrived at the Park Merridian Hotel New York. At that time I had to control a great deal of luggage. After getting off from a taxi I had to move my bags from the taxi to the hotel. Also after check in I had to raise all stuff to my allocated room. Whenever I move my bags I must have tipped but I didn't know how much I should paid for each person a taxi driver a door man or a bell boy. In addition to the next morning I didn't know the exact amount of tip for a room maid. As my tour book 1 dollar was fine but as I remembered 10years ago I tipped 1 dollar for a room maid. In this case which following the book or my intuition based on my memory was the best choice
