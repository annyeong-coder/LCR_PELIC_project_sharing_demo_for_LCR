In recent years we sometimes hear someone says 21th century belongs to Chinese people . So over the next 10 years I think Chinese will be a more important language because there are considerable numbers of people who speak Chinese in China . That's why I think the use of major languages other than English will increase on the World Wide Web. We all know that more and more trademen from other countries want to develop their businesses in China . I think this is the main reason why people study English . Some trademen have already had companies in China but some haven't . They considered about many factors maybe the most important one is how to communicate with local people or coworkers . If they can't speak Chinese or the coworkers can't speak other languages they may have trouble while they work together . In addition the economy in China is getting better now and they have beautiful scenery so more and more tourists want to visit there . When people travel to China they want to be close to local people . Maybe they will have some Chinese classes before they go there . Besides some students from other countries want to go to China and study Chinese . Just like some of my Korean friends they wanted to study graduate school in China so they learned Chinese . Above all these two reasons are why I think the use of major languages other than English will increase . No matter they increase or not it is good for us because we can use many ways to communicate .
