I found a picture in EKEA Catalog of a room which I like it and when I see it I rememmber my grandfather's house. I will describe the room how it looks like. When I look to this picture I feel relaxed and happy. It looks like a musem. It combain a lot of rooms in one room. I imagine that I'm sitting in that room and reading newspaper and enjoing my time. When you sit on the white sofa and doing your homeworks you will feel that the time goes fast. Also I like the dark blue rug which is sutiable with the colures of the walls the celing and the floor. The most interesting thing in that room is the white bookcase which contains magazens and books. In general this room looks nice and orginized very well.
