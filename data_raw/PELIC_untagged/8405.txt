Improving air quality is an important issue in my country China. Because its economy is booming a large number of factories for example coal burning power plants and chemical materials manufacturers are sending off the waste directly into the air before being filtered and cleaned required by the current environment rules. Furthermore car emission makes this issue much more severe. First to alleviate this issue a number of factories that do not abide by the current environment protection law should be closed immediately. Then new laws that set a much higher standard on emission from factories and cars should be put into practice as soon as possible. At the same time putting a cap on the number of factories can lower the total waste in the air further. Other solutions include tax reduction in green gas as an incentive to drivers who use it.
