I have never seen Arabic people since I came to Pittsburgh. It was interesting for me because they have customes that is restricted eating pork. In my apartment there are many Arabic people. A family from Rybia lives in next to my room. It is cultural difference for me. When I walk around the steps to higher level of apartment I can smell of the international foods. I have never eaten middle eastern foods before coming to Pittsburgh. When I can meet someone who is in an elevator people say Hi or Hello each other. I have never said such a words agaist the person who I meet first time. It is comfortable to say something each other . In my country Japan it is not common to speak to strange people. In addition we worry about the person who meet first . There are many experiences that I have never done before coming to Pittsburgh!!
