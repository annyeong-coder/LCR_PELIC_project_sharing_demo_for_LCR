I think that saving endangered animals is important because they are part of the ecosystem. If one of endangered animals were extinct it would influence other animals. If so the ecosystem would be destroyed and human can not live either. To save the animals the government has to make strict laws about poaching the animals. Also the government has to protect the environment so that the endangered animals can live.
