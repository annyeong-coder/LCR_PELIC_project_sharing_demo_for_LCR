When I was pregnant on July 4th my husband my little sister and I went to downtown to see the fireworks that was an amazing Three River Street was very full with people. That was a wonderful thing never seen before. The people who were there they were very happy. A girl was crying with the emotion and the ambiance that was in the place. That was a very existing event. The water of Triangle gold was changing colors. A man was very drunk and he felt in the floor and a police man brings him to the police office. That was my exciting event happened to me in Pittsburgh.
