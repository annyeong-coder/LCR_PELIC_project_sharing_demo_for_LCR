The Beach The beach has always been the perfect place to me every time I need to release myself from any stress. First of all hearing the children laughing and playing with each other can take away all the sadness in my heart. Second looking at the sea and watching the reflection of the sun on it and hearing the waves crash on the shore takes me back in time to many good memories from my childhood. This view reminds me of when I was a child and I used to play with my friend and build sand castles. This is why the beach is my favorite place when I become depressed. The beach has a special magic that can always draw a smile on my face.
