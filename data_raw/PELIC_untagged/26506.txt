It is because of the ways and methods employed at schools and class rooms that pupils end up hating the school and have no creativity. Ongoing evaluation over rewarding unhealthy competition grades pressure and the limits set by adults whether setting the boundaries or watching everything they do are all factors help reduce children's creativity. And lose their curiosity or perhaps be scared to explore by the time they are in grade three or four. I believe the author is right and I can give myself as an example. I had my first grade at home my mother taught me and went to school only to take my final exams. By then I loved math and enjoyed doing math problems because we used to them with a very funny way using those colorful cubes and balls. By the time I entered the regular school I started losing this interest in math. Math was always about tough problems and standing by the board in front of whole class and making mistakes that often got me loud shouts from the teacher and laughter form my classmates. Although I managed to pass all of my math tests I still hate math and do bad at it. And here I am after graduating from college and working for three years as a TA I still consider my GRE test as a nightmare because of math.
