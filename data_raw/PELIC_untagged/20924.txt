Food is like fuel to the human beings in order to grow and build our bodies. According to this fact nutrition scientists are trying to convey the best results of their researches to lead people to the right way for healthier life style. As a result of these researches the US Department of Agriculture USDA had created a food guide pyramid in 1992 to show what are the requirements of food to get nutrition. However due to the flaws of this food pyramid the USDA updated the food guide pyramid with a new design in 2005 as an alternative. Therefore the new pyramid is more accurate than the old one. As comparison between the two of them both are pyramids however the new one is on its side and is brightly coloured. Every colour represents a category Orange grains Green vegetables Red fruits Blue milk products Purple meat and Yellow is for oils or fats. The shape of the categories are stripes each strip represents a particular food group and its width demonstrates the relationship to the other food groups. In addition they added on the side of the new pyramid a drawing of steps as a symbol of the physical activities which reflect the importance of fitness on a person's health. Besides USDA created 12 different designs of the new pyramid that gives people the option of personalize their own food guide unlike the old one had only one size fits all. Overall the goal of these changes is to increase health quality of life of human kind.
