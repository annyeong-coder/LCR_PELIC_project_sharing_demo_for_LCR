The title of this article is in this high school class it is rocket science . It has been interesting subject. The writer here wants to approve that any student can apply what s he is learning and actually use it. He wrote about students and their teacher Brett Williams who they worked on a science project of Fredericksburg High School in Texas Hill Country. That project was amazing project it was unlike any project in the nation. Williams and 22 of his student worked on their project to apply what they have been studied through school years. He started to teach them the lesson plan build a rocket and launch it to the edge of the space . He wanted to give his students a chance to apply what they was studying it that was the answered of the big question that every one ask about it when I will ever use this . They worked on the project as team work check it and finally tried the project that sound like professional aerospace engineering at NASA! They were the beginning of expand this idea to more than schools since 1997 and they had awards and support from different organization like NASA and Texas lawmakers. The writer surprises me by Williams has no degree in engineering. He majored in marine fisheries . That let us don't stop on our major to creative.
