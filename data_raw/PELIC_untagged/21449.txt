Almost all my friends have different personalities. For instance my best friend who lives in Dubai now loves to go to social events too much. On the other hand another friend who is my childhood friend doesn't like social events. Also I have a friend has a job which at the same company I worked for loves to travel like me. Fortunately I have a friend whose sister is very close to me too so sometimes they fight together for me to prove which one is the closet to me.
