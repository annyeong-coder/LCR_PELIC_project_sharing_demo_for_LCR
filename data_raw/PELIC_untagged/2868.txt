My room is bright and sunny in the morning. When I wake up I sit down my bed. After I sit down I think about what I should do today. I look to hang a photograph up. A photograph does my room up. Also an art photograph cheers me up. When I get back at school I change clothes and I put casual clothes on. Before I sleep I look the sky by my room's window. I like my room.
