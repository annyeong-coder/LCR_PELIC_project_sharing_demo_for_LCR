It is true that Korea is a small country. In fact Korea is smaller than Pennsylvania. However Korea is showing to the world how strong Korea is in sports competition such as World Cup soccer Olympics and WBC World Baseball Classic . There is only one team which got to the semi finals in both the World Cup and WBC. In my opinion there are two reasons why explain can prove how this little country is so strong. First of all Korean players have a strong moral strength. Because frustrating days were continuously endured in the past they strongly try to avoid defeat. Korea was colonized by Japan. Right after we were liberated from Japan the Korean War occurred suddenly. We had to fight with Japan for independence and North Korea. We lost a lot and suffered a lot. Koreans know how painful losing is. Additionally the players have a sense of duty for winning. They know the spectators in Korea are always looking forward to winning. Some of them cannot even understand how they lose. The second reason is that Korea has the strong power of the group. For example when Korea was in financial trouble the IMF lent Korea a lot of money in 1997. However this critical moment was finished more quickly than the world expected because most Korean families dominate their value or high price things such as gold for the country. Also at the 2002 World Cup they astonished the world with a red stream . People always wore red things and were all together in front of the Seoul city hall. There were 6. 5 Million people in front of the city hall. That is 14 of the country's population and 65 of Seoul's population. I think those are why Korea is strong in the international sports competition. In Korea there is a proverb that a smaller pepper is spicier than a longer one. How is the small one supposed to be spicier In my opinion there are possibilities for Korea to be stronger in other domains.
