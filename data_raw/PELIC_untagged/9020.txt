Few month ago my sister Ruby got a terrible grade in math exam again. My father was very angry and he told me he wanted to ground her. He though that her fell in math exam again is because she went out with friends everyday. I felt distressed. Undoubtedly she shouldn't have gone out with her friends so often. And she should've prepared exam before she gone with friends. But he should ve talked to her about the math exams before he decided to ground her. Then he ordered me to teach her math and give her some math exercises so that she would have time go out with friends. Surely I would like to teach her math but should I have given her a lot of exercises so that she didn't have time to go out with friends I think it was fun to go out with friends. Besides she was very angry with my father's decision. Maybe I should ve talked with my father before he grounded my sister.
