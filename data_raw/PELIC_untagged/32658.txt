Hi ANON_NAME_0 I heard you really like to travel other country and you are looking for amazing place in South Korea. So I will introduce for you. What I am going to introduce is our country's tourist attraction. South Korea there are a lot of tourist attraction but I think the best place is a JEJU IS. LAND. Because JEJU ISLAND is on UNISCO's world cultural and natural Heritage like and the most beautiful famous and biggest island in South Korea. There are many visitors from other countries also many people are going to JEJU ISLAND for their honeymoon due to captivating sights. If you are planning to a marriage JEJU ISLAND will be amazing place for your destination wedding. Moreover when you visit JEJU ISLAND you will have to visit Jeju Olleh Rode Dragon Head Beach and Jeju Mandarin farm. I went to a lot of place in jeju but the best place to visit was riding the submarine Especially while doing depth inside the sea I saw a lot of colorful fish and corals I've only been in submarine approximately one hour but I think that will be remembered permanent in my life. I really hope you visit JEJU ISLAND with your soul mate
