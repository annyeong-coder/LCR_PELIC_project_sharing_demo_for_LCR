I'm going to be stranded on a desert island for five weeks. Now I should make a to do list. Before I go to the Desert Island I must spend at least 2 hours to do exercises in the GYM everyday let my body get stronger and stronger. Then I might take tooth brush I really don't want to get sick in five weeks. I have to take matches with match we can start to fire and keep our body warm in the night. I must take some chocolates because I can't eat disgusting food. I might go with boys for this trip because boys are brave . I'd better set up timing then record show and tape on VCR before I am leaving. Later I can mail to my parents they live in Shanghai. Tomorrow I could start do exercises first and then I might call my family doctor to do regular health check.
