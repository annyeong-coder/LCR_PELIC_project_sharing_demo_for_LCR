Enemy at the Gates is my favorite action movie decribing a historical bloodbathing battle during WWII. The plot of this movie is based on a novel retouching a real event happened in Stalinggrad eventually leading to a deeply grieved victory of the Soviet red army. It had been reported that over one million people most of whom were residents or very young soldiers had been killed during intensive siege. On the other hand the Nazi also lost 2 tank divisions and a great deal of well trained soldoers leading a inevitable collapse against the Ally. During the very peak of Stalinggrad siege the two sides clearly notived that either intensive seige or stubbern defence is never a wise decision however the two forces were all commanded by politically radical leaders giving front line commandors little space to win a battle. At that time Hiter and Staling both of whom are nororious insisted on wining that personal competetion. That is believed the major reaon turning a relatively low cost seige into a deadlocked street bloodbath. In a real street battle no matter how good your fire power is or how good your military skills are you have to face countless snipers. According to the real situation the plot of this movie is describing snipers' combact starring Jude Law and Ed Harris both of whom performed very good which is one reason that I highly recommend this movie.
