While I was eating a lunch outside a restaurant I saw a blind man. When he tried to cross a street a young man was heading to him. While they were waiting for cross signal I finished my lunch. While they were crossing the street together a crazy driver was driving fast. The driver avoided them and they crossed the street. I felt happy and angry in the same time. Because there is kindhearted young man who helped the blind man and there is irresponsible driver who was driving fast.
