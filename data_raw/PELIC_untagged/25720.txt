My favorite place is the living room at my family house a big room with 3 wide windows. I used to wake up early in the morning open the windows and let the sun and air in. As I am a morning person this could cheer me up and make my day. After going for a walk I bring all my stuff on turn the chairs around and sit down next to a window. Usually I turn on my notebook and read the news while having a cup of coffee. After that I keep on doing my work for 2 or 3 hours later. In addition I write down a long to do list and start working on replaying on emails at first. When I get tired I straighten up the room and take my stuff away and have a rest for half an hour. In fact if I go back I will hang up a picture on the wall next to my place. I have already come up with some different ideas that will add some touches to my beautiful room.
