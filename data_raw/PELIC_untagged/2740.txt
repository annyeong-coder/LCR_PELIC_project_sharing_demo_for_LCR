How One Person Successfully Met Her Challenge When someone has a challenge he can succeed more easily than other people. I have heard about challenge and success in my life and I think that success is not a result of luck. Success is a result of one's efforts and having a challenge is a requirement for one's success. In order to meet a challenge successfully he has to realize what his challenge is and what he needs to conquer it. When someone meets an impending crisis he might strive against all difficulties and overcome for his success. For example my mother became a widow when she was 33 years old. She had four children and didn't have money because her husband died in a car accident. He didn't prepare anything for his family. Unless my mother had been placed in an extreme situation she could not have succeeded. My mother worked to support her children and it was her challenge. She woke up at 2 00 am for working at the wholesale market. After she finished working there she always made a round of calls to collect bills. Then she came home at about 3 00 pm and she did housework. As I have grown I have realized my mother's sacrifice. I think that my mother was successful in taking care of her children. She sometimes said I always thought about success because I was so difficult to living day by day. When I felt comfortable in my life I already made a fortune and my children grown up. She was never afraid of failures and she overcame all difficulties. In conclusion it is important to have a confidence that we will succeed. We don't need to worry about success before meeting a challenge. We need to have 100 confidence about success. Successful people are possibility talking the failure proudly. Successful people have one common feature they aren't afraid of failure.
