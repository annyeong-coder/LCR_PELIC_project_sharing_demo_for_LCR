The pressure of begin an international student in U. S. A. Is visa culture shock and different weather. The process to having a student visa in U. S. A. Has several factor as documents and interview. First of all you must get all necessary documents for the interview. Then you should have to apply in some University or English second English that way you are allow to have the I 20 it is the document that proves you are going to come as legal student. Second you must have the documents to prove where you are going to live and if you have where to live in your own country. Third you are ready to go to the consulate to have the interview. At this time they usually ask all document you have been getting and some several questions. Finally you will wait 1 week to see if your visa is accepted. Another point is culture shock. When you start to live over here you note people are different in many way as say hello and goodbye . In my case I used to hug and kisses people to say hello but over here it isn't normal. In my own experience in U. S. A. I used to do that with American people without intention it was just the customer I had in my country. It took a long time to understand American way and modify my unconscious habit. The weather is so changeable around here especially in the winter time. At the first year I felt it was so cold around here and my clothes were not enough for me. For this reason I didn't want to do thing outside. The second point is how difficult is drive on snow. The car slipping seeing the road is very difficult. It is a scare experience. By the way I took a long time to start to have a little bit experience about driving in the snow and learning the method to drive well in winter time. Begin an international students is a challenge thing to do. However the pressure is big but day by day you are going to be adapting at the different culture customer and environment.
