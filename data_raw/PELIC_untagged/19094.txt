From my point of view it is good thing that many tourists come to my country. Nowadays I acknowledge that many foreign people have been arrested as criminals or drug sellers but it's a minority. Therefore many people are reluctant to accept foreign people because of those incidents. Almost all foreign tourists spend a lot of money that means the government revenue is going to increase. It is crucial for my country because Japan has a lot of debts. Making a stable economy we will rely on tourists in the future.
