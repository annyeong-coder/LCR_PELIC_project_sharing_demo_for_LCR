I have had ability to sympathy with people. I had experienced a lot of problems such as lost eyesight and got burnt in my face by a fire accident before I got the ability. I am short plain and even do not wear nice clothes but people can talk about their stories and emotions comfortably. Because they know I am not going to judge them by listening to their stories. I met the woman and she talked about her story. She lost her kid by an infectious disease. I could feel her feeling as same as she was. So I could be crying with her. Even though she had been very sad before she talked with me. After then she could see herself objectively and control her mind. There were not advises or recommendations to her. I had just listened to her story and been sad with her. I have talked many people who were happy disappointed desperate and sad. And then I realized that everyone needs a person who listens to their stories without any judgments. I am so happy to be the person whom people need to
