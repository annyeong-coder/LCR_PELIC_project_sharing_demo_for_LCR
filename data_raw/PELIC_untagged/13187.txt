I think the English seen as co star is more persuasive. The author uses the statistic to state his opinions. This article is more neutral than Can English be dethroned which is written by France author. I see a lot of criticizing in the dethroned article that blame English has killed the minority languages but did not mention how to prove it. In contrast the Co star author tries to predict the future trend in logic way. For these reasons I think the Co Star article is more persuasive.
