I have three choices of buses from my apartment to Cathedral of learning. The buses have different ways to go to the school and I thought there are not significant differences in taking time. Oneday I got on a bus to go to the school and after a while I found that the bus has a relatively long route to come to the school. So I was late for the first class. I should have checked the bus route more carefully.
