Baniwaled where I grew up was a small village on the northwest of Libya. I had a big family. My brother and sister who lived in the capital city Tripoli visited us once every month. I finished my elementary school in 1982 when I was fifteen years. In the high school I didn't like stories that had unhappy ending. In this age my father asked me a lot of questions most of which I couldn't answer truth. I had a lot of friends but the best friend who helped me when I had problems. My childhood was very great which lived in small village all know each other.
