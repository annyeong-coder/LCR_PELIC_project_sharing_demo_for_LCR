I will talk about my home city Busan and Pittsburgh. These are very different but something is similar. First of all Busan has many schools. Similarly Pittsburgh has many schools. Second Busan citizen like sports similar to Pittsburgh citizen. However they are totally different. At first many foreigners come to Busan for sightseeing. Also many foreigners come to Pittsburgh but they are come to Pittsburgh for studying. Second Busan located in south of Korea so it has many beaches. And then Busan is the second capital city in Korea so it has many sightseeing. This is because people visit to Busan. But in my opinion Pittsburgh doesn't have sightseeing. It has just many museums. However Pittsburgh has famous universities and then they are popular in the world so many students visit to Pittsburgh for improve their knowledge. Third Busan has good traffic system. If some come to Busan he she can easily take the subway. And then they easily go to places who want to visit. Also Busan has many buses. But Pittsburgh has bad traffic system. It has many buses but subway exists in just downtown. So usually people take a bus in Pittsburgh. However if someone has a car he she can feel more convenient than Busan. In Busan If something emergency happened sometimes firefighters and polices are late. This is because Busan has many cars and then often it had a car accident because they don't keep the traffic system and then they drive very fast in addition to me. But Pittsburgh is different from Busan. They always stop to drive when they heard the emergency car sounds. And then I didn't see a car accident yet because they always keep the traffic system. Lastly Busan has many hang out places. Likewise clubs pubs and Karaokes. But Pittsburgh is different. It doesn't have any hang out places. Therefore I felt Pittsburgh is very quite and a good place for studying when I came to Pittsburgh.
