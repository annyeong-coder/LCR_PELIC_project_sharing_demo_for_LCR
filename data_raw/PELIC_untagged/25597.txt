A month ago I found a big mirror on fifth avenue. And I called my friend to pick it up . At first he turned down my request because he thought it was very dirty and useless. I talked him into helping me . At last he decided to go along with me and helped me to hang it up on the wall. The mirror looked toward my bed for 3 weeks. I felt tired when I was doing my homework. One evening I suddenly figured out the strange phenomenon when I was watching a dracula movie on the Internet. The mirror was taking away most of my powers. Therefore I threw it away without hesitation.
