I have to take a toothbrush. I can't start a day withouth brushing my teeth. I should take matches because I can't star a fire with rocks and with a fire I could cook. I must take a knife. I might need a knife for hunting or building my hut. I shouldn't take chocolate because the weather is very hot and the chocolate might melt.
