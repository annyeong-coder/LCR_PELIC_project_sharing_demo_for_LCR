I really like to sleep because when I am sleeping I feel comfortable and happy. On weekend I usually get up in lunchtime in addition sometimes I get up at 3 00 p. M. My friends always say ' why can you sleep for a really long time ' I don't know why I can sleep a lot probably I used to sleep a lot since I was a child. My mother told me a story about my childhood. When I was one or two years old my mother didn't have to care about me as I did not cry a lot. I was always sleeping. I cried when I was hungry but for other reasons I did not cry. My grandmother worried about me that I was dying or not because I was so quiet. I was surprised that I have slept for a long time since I was a baby. Sometimes I get a headache for too much sleep but I cannot stop sleeping for along time. It makes me relax and comfortable. Sleeping heal my stressful life.
