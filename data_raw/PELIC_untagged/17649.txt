I really had a great day today. I visited my freind's house. Everytime I visit them they always welcome me very joyfully. What we did after meal was done is a playing golf in the backyard. I have never played golf so I did not know how I could do well. But What makes me happy is fresh air wide and green yard and nice weather. I could not enjoy the lifestyle like this in Korea because it is much less wider than U. S. Above all I really like this family. All of them are very funny and nice for me. This is why I like them and I am happy with them.
