Women are better parents than men. I agree women are better because she spend more time with her children by reading some books to them or playing with them. I remember when my father goes for business trip for a week and just my mother stay with us. However another reason is the women are softer and understandable the men. When I was a kid I broke the window by my ball so my father yelled at me but my mother tried to stop him because she thought I did not do it intentionally. Therfore the men are not as good parents as the women.
