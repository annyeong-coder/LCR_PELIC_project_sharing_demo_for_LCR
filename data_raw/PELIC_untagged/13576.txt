Compare and contrast between the plays and the movies My nephew asked me about the plays and movies because he heared about them on his school and he want to know more about them. I told him there are many ineresting similarities and differences between the plays and the movies. There are many similarities between the plays and the movies such as both of them depend on the story Also They all must have writer director producer actors and other workers. In addition they need time to prepare their complete works. That's the main similarities between the plays and the movies. On the other hand there are many differences between the plays and the movies such as the plays are live but the movies are not. Also all the characters in the plays have to remember every word in the scenario but un the movies they don't have to do that. You and the audience also have to wait the characters in the plays when they change their clothes but in the movies you don't have to wait them. I think that's the important differences between the plays and the movies. Altough there are many similarities and differences between the plays and the movies but they all still the most intertainment things in our lifes. I will invite you to see that by your self.
