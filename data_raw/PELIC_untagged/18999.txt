I would like to go to the most beautiful island of the world Aruba. Is an island at the Caribbean Sea. Why because there I can enjoy a good weather all year. The beaches are spectacular I can practice different water sports. For example I can surfing one day or scuba diving. Other reason I can enjoy a variety of international restaurants and change the menu every day. Because the money is not a problem I can play in different casinos each night. During the weekend I would like to go to the parties They have a wonderful nightlife. I will spend a lot of time just relaxing a beautiful hotel with spa pool jacuzzi bar casino restaurant. My room will be in the penthouse of the hotel with view to the beach. In conclusion Aruba will be my favorite place in the world there I can find a lot of fun and a unique ambient.
