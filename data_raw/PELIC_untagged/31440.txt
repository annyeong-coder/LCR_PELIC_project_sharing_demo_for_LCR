I love this picture because it reminds me of me and my sisters whom I miss a lot there are three young girls who are sitting in top of each others all of them wearing the same color which is white I like the background which is colorful the oldest girl who sets in the bottom has a beautiful brown her in the top the youngest sister who's sleeping and here is the third sister who sets between those two smiling to the camera.
