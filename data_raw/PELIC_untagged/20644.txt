Yolanda's mother believed Yolanda had an inevitable talent in a poem. As the mother's wish Yolanda became a poet and she has had poetry readings with audiences. However she announced to her family that she was not a poet anymore because she acknowledged she had not written many poems in years. Yolanda's mother tried to manipulate her daughter to be a happy nobody able to enjoy writing and reciting poems than a sad somebody but Yolanda was not convinced. Originally she was a self conscious girl but she transformed to a confident woman as her lover felt like she was a libber. On the other hand Yolanda's mother used to go to all the poetry readings but she didn't know how this threw Yolanda off. Every time the mother attended the poetry reading she enjoyed confiding Yolanda's secrets to arbitrary someone. Yolanda sometimes wrote indelicacies like love scenes with her lover but her mother ascribed those scenes to Yolanda's great imagination. The mother didn't seem to believe Yolanda had her own life which the mother did never know.
