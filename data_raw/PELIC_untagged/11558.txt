Buffon and Zambrotta are the best soccer players of the Italian Team but into to different roster Buffon is a goalkeeper and Zambrotta defender. Probably Zabrotta is faster and stronger then Buffon. But Buffon is the most famous and probably the best goalkeeper in the world he is more more reactive and expert the Zambrotta. Both are really rich and quite famous especially after the last world cup. Probably Buffon is more funny and friendly then Zambrotta he looks like more professional and he keep the soccer more seriously. To guess who is the richest player is not easy probably both of them doesn't have any economic problems. They have almost the same age but probably Buffon will be able to play longer then Zambrotta because the kind of roster like goalkeeper doesn't need specific athletic ability.
