One of the best meals I have had was Philly cheesesteak. That was first American food I ate in the U. S. On Sep. 1St 2009 my husband and I arrived at Pittsburgh. That night we stayed at a hotel in Shadyside. We did not have enough information around the hotel and we couldn't find a place to eat. We ate instant food we brought from Japan. I passed an anxious night because that was the first time for me to stay abroad. In addition we did not brought so much food from Japan and we had to find some place to eat as soon as possible. Now it sounds too pessimistic but in that time I was worried about living in unfamiliar place. Next day we met the couple who were the owner of the house we rent. They were very kind people. After explaining about the house they guided us around Squirrel Hill and took us to their favorite restaurant. At there I ate a Philly cheesesteak. Beef with simple flavoring of salt and pepper is favorite taste for me. That hot sandwich was delicious for my empty stomach. It cheered me up very much. Even if I could not find the other place to eat I could eat cheesesteak!
