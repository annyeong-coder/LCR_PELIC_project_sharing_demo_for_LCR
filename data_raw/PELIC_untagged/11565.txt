My favorite musicians Dave and John. Both of them have different styles. Dave's sound more powerful that John but John's sound was smoothest. John spend two or more hours to practice singing. John usually sing a slower song than Dave. Dave prefer sing a fastest song. Dave's body look like bigger than John but John higher than Dave. If you love rock music or the strongest music I will recommend you to buy John's concert ticket. Although the cost of ticket is the most expensive but it is worth to do. Even though John's concert ticket was cheaper his concert tickets were the best seller of the year.
