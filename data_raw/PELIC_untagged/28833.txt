Some say that the reason why most scientists or engineers are men comes from brain difference between men and women however it isn't true. Obviously societal pressure has existed which has been an obstacle to discourage many brilliant women from pursuing their career as scientists or engineers. First of all since prehistoric age men have controlled the world by using their physical power hunting battles and wars Men have enjoyed their privileges while oppressing their counterparts. As a result women couldn't learn how to read and write except for cooking and cleaning. It is inevitable that those who want to be scientists or engineers have to know a lot of basic scientific knowledge as reinforcing them to perform further research. It is no wonder that the number of female scientists and engineers is less than that of male ones. Secondly science and technology are study requiring comprehensive insight and sensitivity as well as mathematical ability. When it comes to brain difference women's brain has strength to integrate various factors or conditions. Moreover women are not behind men in academic achievement rather they begin to surpass men recently. In many scientific fields more and more women are acknowledged as outstanding scientists. In conclusion being a scientist or engineer has nothing to do with one's natural ability or learning differences between boys and girl
