I think Mc Donald's food taste good and old people young people and children like it for many reasons games and food but isn't good and isn't healthy. The criteria that I used in my evaluation of the restaurant were the taste of the food that is excellent and the nutritional treats that Mc Donald's food has that is so bad.
