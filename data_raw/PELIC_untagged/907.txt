The solution have to involve or participate the webholic students attendence. The other solutions without students participate willingly never will be a good solution. Webholic student s mood aren't succumb to use the internet. They have to statisfy their needs. They shows compulsive behaves about internet. Real solution can provide by their willings. First of all they are believed to their behaviours aren't normal and they need to help about decrease time that they spent on computer. If this participation can provide this problem will have solved by itself. The other compulsive or strict measures will not worked to solve webholics problems. The authority of Univercities should be set up new help centers about this problem. This centers have to observe students on line times on computers and if determine anyone who spend much time on internet after that they call him her to obligatory compulsive interview. When the student come to interview they couldn't be force to decrease their on line time. It will cause to unsolution. The center try to that his her behaviours aren't normal and they try to decrease on line time in aid of them. Like this way the help centers can solve many students online addiction problem.
