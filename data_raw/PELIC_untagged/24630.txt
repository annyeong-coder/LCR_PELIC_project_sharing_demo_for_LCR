I would take a book titled how to survive in an desert island there are books for everything so it must exist one with this topic . With such a book I will be able to do everything without help of all those tools that I won't have. My second choice is a lighter although I have to use it only when it's strictly necessary because I don't want to be run out of gas after the first week. Finally I should choose a machete a big knife because it's very useful although I doubt weather take it or not because I might find a sharp stone that can cut as a knife and I don't want to think I should chose anoter thing!
