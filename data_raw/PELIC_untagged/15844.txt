I have had a bad experience on the phone with a telemarketing call. She called me many times while I was in a vacation. Then I decided to pick up the phone. She told me I'll get a special offer before I become a member in her company. The special offer was 100 gift card from Wal mart without any condition to be member and I can use it any time. Then she gave me a conformation number of the gift card. After that I have to sign up the application online. She talked me into accept her offer. I told her I'll think over your offer with my sister and she told me you can use the gift card from now. To be honest I turned her offer down from the beginning. She kept on talking and talking. I felt she will never stop talking. Finally I told her ok sorry I'm a student and I don't have enough money to participate in any offer even it's good thank you. That was the end of call. By the way I went to Wal mart to make sure I made the right decision and the employees in customer service told me they never hear about this offer. They impressed me but I felt good because I didn't accept the offer and I'll never answer the telemarketing again
