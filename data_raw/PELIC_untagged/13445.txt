The most of my life I used to live in Tunja. But now I am living in Paipa. When I lived in Tunja I used to study but now I work . I didn't use to glasses but now I used. I used to be fat but now I am ok. I didn't use to dance with my friends but now I going to dance with they. I didn't use to play video games But now I play it is my hobbi favorite. In the college I didn't have a car but now I have one. I used to play soccer but now I play squash and finally I didn't use to eat vegetables but now I eat them. These are changes of my life more important.
