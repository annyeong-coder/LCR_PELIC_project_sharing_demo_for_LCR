Life without someone who cares and loves you with unconditional love is just like an empty world. I think the only person who has these specifications for me is my mother. I think she has a very difficult life but she has a fabulous personality. My mother is medium height she is approximately 5' 3'' tall with a thin body. She has this healthy beautiful body because she cares about her nutrition and she doesn't eat too much. She has shiny short straight hair. It's dark brown. She has fair and soft skin with a mole above her lips. She wears glasses and she dresses very well in a simple way at the same time. Transition occurred in her life may have the influence on her personality. Her family moved to another country so she had to live away from her relatives. Her father died when she was 18 years old. After that she went to a college which she had to use 3 different means of transportations to reach. After her graduation she chose to delay her marriage and obtain a job to support her family for about 8 years. As a mother she is the best mother in the world. I think she is the most unselfish person I've ever seen. She supports us from the first years in our lives and faces any difficult situation with her wisdom. Also she can hide her pain and show a smiley and friendly face. She doesn't talk a lot but she uses dialogue and persuasion instead of cruelty in our upbringing. She is so patient. My mother's unconditional love makes her my hero. I wish one day be able to be like her especially when I have children.
