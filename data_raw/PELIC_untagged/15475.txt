Saudi Arabia The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is an age long historical country. Nowadays It has an estimated population of 27. 6 Million. All of the population in Saudi Arabia are Islam. One of my classmate is an Arab. He told me The most important thing for Arab is religious . Everyone must do the religious rite 5 times for a day. This rite is inherited more than hundred years. Their noticeable dressing is a scarf for covering a woman's head and an arab hat for a man. All of these mean the faithfulness for their God. Saudi Arabia is an interesting historical country to learn about.
