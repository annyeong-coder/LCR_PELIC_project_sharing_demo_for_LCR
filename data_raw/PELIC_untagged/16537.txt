There was many things I did last weekend. First of all Friday night I went directly on my friend's house and we went to the movie togother. I was so exciting about the movie. For example I have never seen a gripping movie story like that it was interesting . In addition I woke up late on Saturday and suddenly remembered I had to do my homework before left. Because I went to the club with my girlfriend that night also I Have to go shopping on Sunday with her. But when We were in the store clothes I was so tired and I did'nt buy nothing for me. The last day on Monday I stayed home and talked with my family Africa. They told me you have to go back because your familly misse you. I said soon got bless . In conclusion because of exciting shopping and talked with my family I passed a nice weekend.
