Topic The qualities of good friend Writing 4M A friend who can be on your side and listen to your problems is a good friend. There are three reasons that I concerned the qualities of good friend are supportive positive and self developed. First a good very has to be very supportive whenever you have troubles. She or he can help you to undergo your difficulties. It's no matter how busy she or he is she or e is sensitive and helps you to solve your obstacles. Second it is very important for people to have an optimistic attitude. We don't want to be in the miserable love company which means the way you think about the life is negative. Also delightful people make people happy. Lastly I think that a good friend has to enhance she or himself very well in order to knowledge each other. Learning is the best way that you won't be eliminated from this fast developing society. A knowledgable friend also can motivate your learning desire.
