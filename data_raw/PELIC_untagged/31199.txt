Environmental Pollution I can really consider out earth in dangers not only because of the dictators people but because of the every single person who actually do not have the enough knowledge about the offensive affect of their action s that I can put them in this three main headlines Air soil and water. These are the most significant things in my opinion which is very important to find out a good solution for it. First of all in my point of view I can see that the most important thing in this earth which is the air that we actually use to breath and to make up our fire to cock. Also we use it for go through this majority and discover new things. With out this air basically we cannot survive. In the other hand some people who I can understand their perspective which is depending on the other to and take out their selves out of the case. This people are Cigarette Smoker some of the owners of the cars that produce exhaust and finally the factories. Cigarettes are bad for both of us the smoker and us and I mean by us the people who do not smoke. They mix up the pure air with unhealthy one. It is hard to understand the way this people smoke. They actually do this bad habit in every wear. For instance This morning I was in walking to the cathedral and there was a person smoking in the crass walk and his smoke was killing me. This kind of persons should understand that we do have the right to breath clean air. The next cause is the cars and the factories that make the air worse by burning chemical materials. When the babies born in this kind of pollution environment with no thinking he will have really bad daises. In order of this three really affective causes we should make a serious big step to stop the pollution in our air. Second the most second important things in this earth is the soil. The human garbage which is come from every body
