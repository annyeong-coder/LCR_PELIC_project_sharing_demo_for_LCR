In our day there are a lot of thing that can't be explained by science. Especially I'll talking about U. F. O. Unidentified flying object . U. F. O. Has been observed in all parts of the world after the first sighting was observed by private flyer K. Arnold in 1947. The most famous event was a U. F. O. Crashing in Rosewell in 1947. But Rosewell's evidences were covered by U. S. A. Government. At that time in this area where was became well known by U. F. O believers. After that day scientists have been trying to find out what is this but couldn't easily be identified. There are several explanations what it is. Most theories are merely guesses. But U. F. O. Is known as the external objects. I believe that it will be revealed what is this someday.
