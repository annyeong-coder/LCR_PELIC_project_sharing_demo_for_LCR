My friend Tatyana and her husband Leo live in Daytona Beach Florida. A beautiful black cat called Darya with white paws lives with them. About 18 years ago Tatyana found Darya on a street. The cat was hungry and sick and did not let anyone touch him but Darya liked Tatyana. Since then Darya became a member of the family. Like all cats Darya has bad and good habits. One bad habit that Tatyana does not like at all is Darya morning's visits to the master bedroom to wake them up. The cat is able to mew so insistently that Tatyana does not have to setup her alarm clock. Despite of Darya's morning annoyances the cat is very artistic. When Tatyana takes pictures of the cat Darya is able to pose for her for a long time. The cat is also very loyal. When Tatyana leaves for work Darya can sit for hours near the door waiting for her return. In the evening Tatyana and the cat are walking around having dinner and watching TV. It seems they are able to enjoy each other very much.
