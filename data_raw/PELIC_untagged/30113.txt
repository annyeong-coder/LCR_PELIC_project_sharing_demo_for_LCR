Last week I watched a movie about emperor penguins that live in the south pole. Emperor penguin lives the hole year in the south pole which has extreme weather that human being cannot tolerate. The movie which produced on 2006 shows the emperor penguin life that contains a lot of obstacles that he face. The movie Life of Penguins has won many prizes not because the movie exciting but also help many people to understand penguin's life.
