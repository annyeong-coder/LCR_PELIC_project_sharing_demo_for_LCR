Since I have been in U. S. I got a phone call from unnamed person who speaks Spanish. I often got that call so I tried to find out why they always called me. I thought that it happened because I filled some forms out for affiliating the clubs. I tried to take me away in the list but unnamed Spanish person called me back often. I hung up the phone with saying that could he look up the list which left out my name. But still I had a phone call from there so I finally gave it up. I figure out that problem for getting new phone number.
