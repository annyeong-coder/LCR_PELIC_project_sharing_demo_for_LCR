Juno is the one of my friends who attended same high school with me. He was born from the ik san city where is famous about jewelry in Korea. When I met him first time I thought his face which covered with many hurt marks made me scary. At that time I did not expect him to be my friend. The reason of that how I was to would be his friend was related with smoking. Smoking is still excluded for students who under 18 years in Korea. So buying cigarette was big problem to me when I was high school students. However because Juno has frighten and looked older face he could buy cigarette easily. Simply I thought if I was friendly with him who did not worry about buying cigarette I do not need worry about it also. Then Day by day I was attracted by him. He had same hobby that watching the violent movies with me. So in most of the days when I was with him we went the cinema which is located in downtown.
