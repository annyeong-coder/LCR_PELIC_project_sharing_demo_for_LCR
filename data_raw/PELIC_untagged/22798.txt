I agree with the author's opinion. At first when children go to school they do not have the pressure of going to high level school and study for them is not important. Also for parents they do not care about children's scores at the beginning. But when it comes to the third or fourth children have to face the competition of going to good middle school high school and university. At this time study becomes the most crucial point of their life so they need to learn what they do not like. So difinietly they will lose their interesting and pleasure.
