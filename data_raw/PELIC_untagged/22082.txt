Or students to go back home. This is the reason why the Spring Festival is so important for the Chinese people. In China food is not just important but a part of culture. It is traditional to eat certain food during the holiday such as dumplings nian gao fish and spring rolls. These have individual meanings for good fortune. For example my favorite food is nian gao. The word nian means year in Chinese and the word gao means high in Chinese so nian gao sounds like getting higher year by year . Chinese people always like to save more money at the end of the year so they like to prepare fish as a main dish because the Chinese pronunciation of fish sounds like more saving . Most people like spring roll very much because it contains pork and vegetables. They are very nutritious and delicious. The big New Year's Eve dinner is the most important in a year so it must be abundant and there is a great variety of different dishes. There are a lot of activities during the Spring Festival and people usually start to prepare for the celebration of the Festival a week before. They decorate their houses with red lanterns and red paper cuttings. They buy a lot of food. On New Year's Eve families get together at the grandparents' house usually at noon. Some of them start to prepare the big dinner and the other people chat watch TV and play card games. People usually go out to see fireworks after dinner and again at midnight. Many people set off fireworks on the streets. With the sound and light of fireworks you can absolutely feel the atmosphere of the Spring Festival. This is my favorite part of Spring Festival. The most important holiday in China is a great time for people to get together and celebrate. There are a lot of food and activities and it's always an exciting and happy moment for 1. 3 Billion people.
