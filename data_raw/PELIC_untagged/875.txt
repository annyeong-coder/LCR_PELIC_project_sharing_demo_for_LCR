October 17 2006 Dear basma I thought a lot before I write this letter. You asked me to buy a computer and you don't decide which sort do you want P. C or laptop. In this letter I am going to compare between them. At first booth P. C laptop are almost same price. Second laptop is easier carrying than P. C so you can take it with you wherever you want. On the other hand if you have P. C you can improve and add new hard wear. In addition the P. C lives longer than laptop. Finally if buy P. C you will have P. C table rather than laptop. Think about that my love I hope to buy something gives you more flexibility when you are moving. Love
