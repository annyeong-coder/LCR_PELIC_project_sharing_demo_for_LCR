I have always been able to read people's faces. I have been raeding people's faces since 1996. One day in 1996 I was playing football when I saw that my brother's face was black. I knew he was angry. We had been playing for a long time but this was crazy. Since that day in 1996 I have always known the feelings on people's faces and the information has always been the truth.
