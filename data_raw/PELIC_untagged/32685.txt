Graduating from the high school I applied to the university to get my Bachelor degree. If I had chosen the Obstetrics and Gynecology as my major I'd have my own clinic in my city. Unfortunately I started my journey by studying computer science. Were I continuing studying computer science I'd harm my brain. Changing my major to business field helped me to achieve my goals. Had I not gotten married I could have been in a higher position in a successful firm. Were I still working in my country now I'd be living close to my family. I am not unhappy right now because the decisions I made because if I hadn't gotten married I wouldn't be studying in the ELI now.
