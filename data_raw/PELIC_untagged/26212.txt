Every group of people has their culture and history. These factors contribute in formation of their characteristics. Thus the way of thinking and their attitude originate from their deep culture which makes them different from other. According to this difference every single member in any group should know about the culture of any people especially if he lives in this culture. This will help him to deal with any culture in a perfect and polite way. Therefore I agree with Dr. ANON_NAME_0. If people know about the culture of each other they will be able to live together with respect. Also this will help to prevent conflict or eliminate it. I have experience with this in my region. We have two groups townspeople and nomads. Because townspeople have an idea about the odd behaves of nomads they are able to live with them without being in any conflict.
