I think that dating online is not the right way to meet the person you will share the rest of your life with for many reasons the first reason that nobody will disclose all the truth about himself to other person in cyberspace so we shouldn't believe the personal profiles showed in those sites . Secondly such conversations are full of Wight lies fibs so you cannot depend on these conversations to build a strong relation . Moreover it is silly to trust someone you never deal with him in the real life because there is a big difference between dealing through the internet and dealing in the real life that's why most of the people whom tried those sites met illegible partners and their experiences were bad. All in all I recommend anyone especially if he was my friend to avoid dating through those sites and look to his love in the real life.
