In the age of the computers finding a book in a library has become very easy. The first step is find the computers that contain library's catalogs. There are two catalogs one for books and one for periodicals so in the book catalog type the topic you are seeking information about in the space labeled Subject . After that scroll through the entries for the books that are displayed on the computer screen and determine which ones seem the most relevant. Then write down the title and call number of each book that you want. Next locate the books on the library shelves by their call numbers. Finally take the books to the check out desk and be prepared to show your library card at the checkout desk.
