I am a Japanese doctor. My specialty is internal medicine. I had worked at a Japanese rural hospital for four years after my residency. I would like to work in the United States medical residency program to study primary medicine. I have two daughters and their ages are 3 years and 6 months. I really miss them. I would like to bring my family to United States the next year.
