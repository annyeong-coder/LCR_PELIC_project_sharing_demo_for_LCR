I'm ANON_NAME_0! I lived in Seoul South Korea until Jan 2007. I moved to Pittsburgh in Feb 2007. I've lived on Beechwood Blvd with my family since Feb 2007. I haven't worked in Pittsburgh but I have been looking for a job since I arrived in Pittsburgh. I like to play golf. I've played a lot of times when I worked in Korea. I've already played golf five times in Pittsburgh but I have not yet played golf this month. The price of country club in Pittsburgh was reasonable. Also I' liked country songs since 1975. I've been listening to country songs while doing my assignments. I've been studying English at University of Pittsburgh since this summer.
