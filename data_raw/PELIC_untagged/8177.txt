I can't forget the day when my aunt's and my family went to the sea to have lunch. In those days I really hated any kind of meal made of fish so I usually waited outside while my mother grilled fish. However in that day I had to go to the sea to have sushi because it was a special day for someone I can't remember the person. When I got there I was bored so went to the kitchen where people make alive fish to sushi. It was very interesting for me because fish was not dead even though people cut their head so I was sitting there for a while until somebody called me for lunch. When I got back to my family waitress was serving sushi with head which was moving its mouth. As soon as my cousins saw the moving head they were screaming and running away from it and crying. I was laughing behind the wall where nobody could see me because I knew they were going to be freaked out. Ha Ha Ha. It was very curious moment because they loved to eat sushi unlike I hated it. After some person got into our room and removed the head my cousins they started eating like there was nothing happened. However I had to eat little egg and some Kimchi. I felt it was unfair. I guess I was not a decent child.
