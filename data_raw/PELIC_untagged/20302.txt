Divorce is one of the biggest problems in our life because it has an effect on the couple who divorced and the children. That leads to a problem in the whole society. However I believe that the three major impacts of the divorce are on the couple the children and the world. First impact of the divorce is on the couple. For instant people who divorced usually went throw a miserable time with each other to end up with this decision. Also after the divorce most people can't acclimate with their new life for that reason they usually get into a depression. Another impact is on the children. For example a lot of studies agreed that the probability of getting a physiological problem in a child who lives in a divorce family is higher than a normal child. In addition people who rose in a divorce family are more likely to make crimes rather than others. Last impact of the divorce is on the world. According to crimes history most criminals had a miserable childhood. This miserable background encourages them to attend a crime. In conclusion the divorce impacts the family and the whole world. Because of that I believe the divorce is one of the biggest problems we have today.
