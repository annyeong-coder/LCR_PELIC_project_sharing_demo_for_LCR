Center A traditional house in China Indent A traditional house in rural north China is usually spacious simple and vital. When the hosts are at home they often have the door opened as a signal of welcoming all the guests or passersby. A big Fu stuck the wall which is a great word in Chinese culture symbolizes luck and happiness will come in you eyes before you enter the yard. In some house a small mirror is put up on the top of the wall. It was used to obstruct some evil ghost. By crossing the wall there is a spacious yard with a big tree in the center. The sunshine passes the leaves and the cool wind is in shadows. Some children might play a game in shadows. A living room is usually built in the north of the yard. The red door and the shining window reflect the simple and unadorned style. The bedrooms are often in two sides of the living room and the doors are always closed. There are privacy spaces of the host. On the right of the living room is a small kitchen. The Chinese people used to cook food by an original fire several years ago so the wood was piled on and occupied half of space. The rich fragrance of the delicious dishes retains in the kitchen. Some domestic animals such as chicken or duck live in a covering in the left of the living room. In the daylight they could wander in the yard and look for some food but they would go back their house at night. The bathroom is placed in a corner of the yard. These kinds of house are replaced by more and more new modern houses but there are still memorable places for most of Chinese.
