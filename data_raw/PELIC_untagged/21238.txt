My goal is to get a PhD degree in Pharmacology. Before getting a PhD I have to study English. I have studied English at the ELI since January which has reinforces my English background. Applying for a degree in the United States you must have GRE and TOEFL scores. Upon getting TOEFL score I applied for master's degree. Applying for master's I had a GRE classes for one month but I don't have taken the GRE yet. So far I have achieved around 20 to 30 of my goals. Being in the USA I will visit Niagara Falls. Also I will try to attend Spanish classes in Summer.
