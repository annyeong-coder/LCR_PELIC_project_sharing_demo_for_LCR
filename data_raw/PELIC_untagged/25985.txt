The fact that referees misjudged too many things in the World Cup game is shocked me. I already recognized that several misjudge can happen always because a referee is also a human. However lots of people think that the referees of this World Cup game is unqualified. Last Saturday I was disappointed that England team was eliminated from the round of 16. Although many England fans admitted that Germany played pretty well and deserved to win most of them complained that the referees were unfair. I also was shocked that the referees ruled out the goal of Lampard the players of England team. It was evident that the ball crossed the goal line and rolled outward. I believe that the second goal of England may change the flow of the match. What makes me more irritated is that there were many more misjudges in this World Cup game. I don't know why FIFA don't introduce video interpretation system.
