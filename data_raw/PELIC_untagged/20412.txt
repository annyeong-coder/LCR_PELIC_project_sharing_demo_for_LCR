I had never thought to study abroad before I was an exchange student six years ago. The reason was I did not like English. However the exchange student program made me change my mind and stimulated my desire to study abroad. I gave up many times because of my English skills and the high cost of studying here. Nevertheless I still wanted to study abroad. Therefore before I came here I had been working hard for five years to improve my English and collect money in order to make my dream become true.
