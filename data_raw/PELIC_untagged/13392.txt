I used to wake up late untill I have got married then I used to wake up early to go to the work and to earn money. I used to take a breakfast ever day but now I just have some time for a cup of coffee I used to pike a bicycle and my father uses to go early to the work before retired. Today I use to drive my car and taking my kids to the school and used to wake up very early I didnot get use to walk and I get use my laptop and internet exploration and stdying. I also get use to watch Tv at night only.
