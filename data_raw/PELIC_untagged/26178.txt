The basis of ANON_NAME_0's belief is that he regarded 'stereotype' as a starting points for understanding other cultures and social groups. If everyone can understand the others by using stereotype it would be helpful to resolve conflicts. However I believe that it doesn't work always. Of course sometimes stereotype is helpful to understand some groups since having stereotype means that I already have interesting or information about them. However if I already had some bad stereotype like prejudice or biased attitude toward some groups it might disturb getting to know them more. Before I came here I had never met any Arabic people. Since I had never imagined meeting Arabic people I didn't know well about Arabic people and culture. The only stereotype that I had was most Arabic people are not at all open religiously and culturally. Since this stereotype affected me negatively I wasn't sure that I can be friends with Arabic people. Now I know that there are lots of open people from Arabic countries. However it is obvious that the stereotype affected taking a long period of time to be closer to them.
