If I hadn't been born two important areas of my life would have been changed. First my family might have had another child if I hadn't been born because my parents wanted three children. If they had had another child they might have been a boy. They would have sold their company when they are old if their child hadn't been an engineer. They wanted me to study Engineering for working in their company. My family couldn't have fixed computer at home if my parents hadn't given my birth. Second my friends would have laughed if I hadn't been there because I always tell the funny story to my friends. If I hadn't been born they might not have taught the lesson for me because I asked some question about our lesson when we studied in university. If I hadn't been here my ELI friends wouldn't have seen me and we wouldn't have traveled to other places together.
