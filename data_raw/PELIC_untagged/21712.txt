I think that the best meal I have had in Pittsburgh is the dinner in Hokkaido seafood buffet in Dec. 31 2009. Though I have been to this restaurant for several times I'm really satisfied with the dinner of that night for this restaurant prepared foods very well to celebrate the coming New Year. It's no doubt that the foods in the dinner were fresh carefully cooked and serviced quickly. First the dishes such as sashimi lobster and meat are exactly fresh. The color and tasty of these foods were very great and I really enjoyed them. Second the chefs in the restaurant carefully prepared all of the dishes especially the special dishes fried lobster and toasted lamb. They used different spices and sauces to make foods have wonderful flavor. Third though the restaurant in that night were crowed with customs and the delicious foods were eaten up quickly the dishes and drinks were always serviced in good time and the tables kept clean and neat all the night. I think I inherently crave nice food and this restaurant is just to my taste. The foods of that night deserved what I paid.
