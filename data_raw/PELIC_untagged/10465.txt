Finally I could to study. I saw movie for outside listening and did my homework. In this weekend was not happened something interesting or special. Saudi party Last Friday I went to Saudi party with my friends. We listened pray in Saudi language. We saw Arabic marriage dances. It was surprising that in Saudi only men can dance to public. Also we saw real marriage on TV screen. In this country young man and women can't see each other to marriage time they sit in individual room. After main part we went to other room where many activities were. People could take pictures in Saudi dress make tattoo and buy some souvenirs. In another room we tasted Arabic food. It was a nice experience to know some information about Saudi culture.
