If had to go to a reality TV show called Desert Island I might bring matches. With matches I can make a fire to the wood and cook. I think I should bring some chocolate and food so that I wouldn't cook. I should also bring a blanket because it must be very cold there. I could also bring a knife to protect myself because it must be dangerous there. I ought to bring a solar powered computer to entertain myself or charge my ipod on it. I'd better bring my toothbrush or my teeth would be stained.
