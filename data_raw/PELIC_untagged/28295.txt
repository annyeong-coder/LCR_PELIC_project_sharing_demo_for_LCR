My parents moved into a condominium at 2007 they have lived there for 3 years. I left my family several years ago and I usually go back home once every two years. I haven't seen my family almost for 1 year and a half. My brother has already graduated his medical school since 2008 and now he is a surgeon. Last year my sister married she and her husband were classmate at junior high school. They have known each other for 10 years.
