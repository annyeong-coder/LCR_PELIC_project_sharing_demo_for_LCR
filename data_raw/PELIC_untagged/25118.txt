I think we should take a great deal of water. Because I think there is not alot of water in desert island. Any fishing equipment is much better to rserve food. Several radio to be aware about what is happen in outside. Also it should be to take enough copasses to locate our direction or area. Finally we must be get any maps of area to assist as with compass to know about direction.
