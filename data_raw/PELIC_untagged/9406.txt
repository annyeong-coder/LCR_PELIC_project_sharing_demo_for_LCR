When I was a high school student while going to the library my friends and I saw a car accident. A certain car hit by 3 police cars and two policemen largely wounded. At that time I did not know exactly how happened the accident. Next day I saw newspaper in order to know how happened the accident. The accident happened by a drunken driver. He was caught in a general crackdown on drunk drivers. When he was taking a drunken test he suddenly ran away. Therefore when policemen were chasing him this accident had been happened. However after all they lost him. The suspect was arrested the other day since the wounded policemen remembered the suspect's car number. However unfortunately one of the wounded policemen was killed.
