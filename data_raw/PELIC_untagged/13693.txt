It's a photo of the Chaplin Family. Grandfather Martin and Grandmother Philippa are sitting in the front. Martin is wearing a pair of glasses with a big smile. Philippa is wearing a sleeveless shirt. In the back row Katy stands on the far left. Just right of her is Martin and Philippa's granddaughter Catherine around 5 year old. Next to Catherine on the right side of her is Helen. Catherine is held between Katy and Helen. On the far right is Tim. He's wearing a black shirt with blue jeans. Based on their clothing the picture is probably taken in summer.
