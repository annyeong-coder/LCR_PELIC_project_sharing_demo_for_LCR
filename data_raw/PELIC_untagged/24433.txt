ARGUMENTATIVE ESSAY ROCHELLE Last Name MARCH 25 2010 THE TOEFL IS AN UNFAIR EXAM Nowadays obtaining an international degree is a dream for many people. It is an excellent choice for whoever wants to improve his or her education and gain professional prestige. In order to be accepted in an International degree in The United States one must take a specific test called the TOEFL that proves proficiency in the English language. However the structure of the test is unfair and the exam is unnecessarily expensive. During the TOEFL the students have 4 er him freeze and become incapable. Students may be qualified academically but for economic reasons cannot pay the high price required. The exam costs 170. 00 Each time. This is unnecessary because at the same time in the same room there are 20 people taking the test with you. It is a totally 3 570 dollars. Also I did an informal survey and most people have to take the test to get scores more than once. I believe that this is really an excellent form of making money off of foreign students. The test company takes advantage of them. Some people say that the TOEFL proves proficiency in the English language. Some people speak English very well and pass the test it is true. However some people are more capable than the test shows. Some people type slowly. Some people read slowly in their native language and also in English. Some people have a block because it is such an important thing. Consequently it demonstrates many things that are not English proficiency. In conclusion The TOEFL exam could be a great method of evaluation but it does the opposite. It makes an international degree a hard dream and one of the most expensive things for students or profession who want to appreciate knowledge. The TOEFL should be reformulated to make it easier and make selection of students more just. This will be a good thing for students and schools.
