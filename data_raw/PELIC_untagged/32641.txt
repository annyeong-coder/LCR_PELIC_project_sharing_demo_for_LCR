2 I lived with my parents and my siblings whom you've met. 5 I had two sisters who I felt compatible with and an older brother. 6 It was a large old couch which my father had made himself. 7 My best friend whose family I loved lived across the hall. 11 They sold delicious bread and cake which people stood in line for hours to buy. 12 My brother and sisters who I miss live far away now.
