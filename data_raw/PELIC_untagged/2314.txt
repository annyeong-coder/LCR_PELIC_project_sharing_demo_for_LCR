When I was a high school student I was not a good student. When I wanted to go to see a movie I sometimes skipped classes and went to see a movie with my friends. After watching the movie I went home at 7 p. M. Because if I went home after the classes it was 7p. M. So my parents believed that I was from school. But I should have attended the classes. I could have gone to see a movie after the classes. And I should not have said my parents a lie or I could have said them that I skipped the classes.
