I think flow in the article is a status where children concentrate on their work so deeply and create a result which is beyond their expected capability. Because of Korea's educational situation which has many restrictions to children and imposes strict grades I couldn't experience flow much. Actually I was also a similar child to the writer of the article. I really liked drawing pictures but after I was taught how to draw well I was so disappointed by my work because mine was so poor compared to samples. As a result I stopped drawing pictures by myself and sometimes I didn't prepare for drawing class due to lack of interest. However when I came to the U. S. And started to study I found myself more creative than before even though some restrictions still existed in the U. S. From my perspective one of the differences between the two countries' education system is how much a student's thought is respected by a teacher and other students. Because of that when I do homework in the U. S. I dip into a homework problem more and I can speak my opinion in front of others more. In addition I can listen to different opinions from other students which provides more considerations and encourages me to try to discover underlying knowledge more in a subject. There exists more attributes to produce flow but respect is the most important one among them.
