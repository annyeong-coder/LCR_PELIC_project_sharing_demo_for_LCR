My best friend is attractive for me. At first she is dependable. Whenever I consult about my work or my life she gives me good advice. Second she is very considerate. As soon as I am in trouble at work she is aware of that and she helps me. In addition she has a good musical sense. She is good at singing and playing the piano. She has different charm.
