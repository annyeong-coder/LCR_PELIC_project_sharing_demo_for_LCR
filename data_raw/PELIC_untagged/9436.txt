My living room is a rectangle. When you walk in the door the first you can find large window. Green curtains hang on the window. The left wall is lined with a sofa and a tea table. A sofa can sit maximum is 3 people. My TV and the TV table are on the wall to the right so when I sit down the sofa I can see TV. My desk locate beside the TV table. There is my roommate's desk next to the my desk so sometimes my roommate and me study together. The kitchen table is located in the center of living room.
