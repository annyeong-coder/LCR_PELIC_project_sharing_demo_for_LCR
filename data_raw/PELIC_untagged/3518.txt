Dear Kate Regarding to last time we've talked about the preparation for next barbeque party I've looked for quality workable and absolutely it's inexpensive Gas Grill. In fact I put three things to compare between the two numinous models cost size and the quality material. Let me called the first model is A and the second one is B to make the comparing easy. First I'll take about quality material model A has good quality than model B. For example it has premium quality 304 grade double walled stainless steel hood but the other one hasn't. So we don't worry for hand burn as last time. Second thing I want mention it is the size and the features that each one provided such as number of them hold burgers 4 and the burner. The total area of A is bigger than B it's 659 sq. In but the B is 530 sq. In. There little bit different between them for no. Of hold burgers 4 at same time. A holds 28 and B holds 24. So A is workable than B. Also A has two plus burner than B. It's 4 burners. Finally the very important point for me is the cost. Unfortunately A is more expensive than B also after the discount. It's 299. 99 That is a double B's cost. That is changing my mode and mind. After all that I've an idea about what I buy it but I need your think and agreement. I'm suggesting the second one B because it's workable and useful at this time. By the way we can buy two if we look for the size. I'm waiting your feedback as soon as possible please.
