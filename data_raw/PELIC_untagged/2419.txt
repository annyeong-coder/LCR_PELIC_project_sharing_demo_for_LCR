Love is a small work with a big and strong meaning. Valentine's Day is the day that we celebrate the meaning of the love. It is the day to celebrate the love that we have for each other. Love can be sprees in many different ways and all those ways mean the same. It send the massange that you care for other people. I will celebrate the love that I have for my sister. My sister is my only and best friend. I love her with all my heart and soul. Even though we do not always agree with each other it is not the reason for we do not have a great relation. Anyway we do not have to always agree with each other but we must respect each other and we do. She always respects me as a person and I always respect her as a person. That is the most important in our relation. We are always there for each other without a word. This is the beauty of our relation. The support that we always give for each other.
