I woke up yesterday 10 am. I clarified my plan which I thought about yesterday. I shouldn't have forgot that I should not discriminate human being. I should learn living together. This is a rational idea. Suddenly I get out from this ambiguous thinking. I cooked my breakfast. As soon as I finished it My door was knocked and my friend appeared and started to generate too many kind of problems. I shouted the door. He triggered me to be anger. Later on I accessed the medicines which is on the refrigerator which is parallel to the wall and took one. And then I woke up really this time Unless I realized that I was dreaming. Stupid but I am try to enhance it.
