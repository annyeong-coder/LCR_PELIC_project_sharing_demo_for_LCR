I am an introvert who likes being alone. I like being with friends who I like but sometimes I want to be alone and I don't like places where there are many people who I don't know well. And I also don't like to speak in front of many people. I am an introvert rather than an extrovert. I am a person who relies on past experiences so I am sensor. I am not an intuitive who concerns about what might happen in the future. I am a feeler who doesn't make decisions on the basis of logic and I am a person who rarely practices what I planned ahead.
