My house big so this ia cheer me up. My house tow floor every weekend my wife clean it up. We have pick up tow lamp for the living room because it dark at night. But because the manager charge up the electricity so we take one lamp of and we turn on the another. Sometime my neighbor tyrn the music up at night so I tried to leave but the manager didn't let me out because I should stay minimum six months so I will after this period to pick up a new house.
