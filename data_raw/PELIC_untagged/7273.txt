I was born in 1975 when my mother was 28 years old. I grew up in a country city where I was born. The city has a zoo that every Japanese knows. I have been there more than 10 times because my house where I have lived for 20 years was very close to the zoo. When I was an elementary school student I often went to the zoo with my friends who like animals. I liked giraffes which I was always seeing for a long time. But now the zoo is very crowded everyday and the parking area where many sightseeing tour buses are parked is also crowded. I'm very sorry that it became uncomfortable to stay there.
