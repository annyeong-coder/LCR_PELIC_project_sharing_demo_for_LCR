Who is my soul mate who I love my soul mate is my wife who I love her so much. My wife is the most beautiful woman in the world whose heart is pure and white. I have been happy with her since we got married and we enjoy our life that is different from others. Also we have had a new baby last February whose name ANON_NAME_0. Every new day our life becomes more excited with little boy. Every day I miss my wife and my son who are every thing I have in my life.
