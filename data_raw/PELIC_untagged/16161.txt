Civil Engineer Civil Engineer is one of the most common careers that people like to be. Civil engineer is a person who designs and constructs many structures. To be as a civil engineer you have to graduate from school of civil engineering which consists of three branches structural transportation and water supply. Civil engineer is the person who is able to design many kinds of structures such as bridges dams roads dooms tunnels airports. . Etc. Civil engineer is a responsible person so he or she has to be aware of many factors during the design starts with costs through to safety and the serviceability for the building to bear the weather factors and other external forces in the words we are looking for the durability for the structure. Because this career is broad job therefore many people like this kind of jobs because they will have the opportunity of raking in money and getting good experience. By contrast this job with others civil engineer earns much money than other jobs for example for a person has already graduated from school of engineering he can earn at least 45 000 per year.

First of all the student who graduates from school of engineering civil engineering department has to work at least 4 years to have sufficient experience to start his career because some of engineers work at offices and others like to work at sites knowing that some sites is located far away from their house. Second once he has enough experience he will be able to be as a civil engineer and may be by the time he can be as a consultant. Finally some people consider that being civil engineer is more responsible more a doctor because when the doctor makes a mistake with his patient during surgery he can cause of killing him. However if the civil engineer made a mistake during design he would kill many people.
