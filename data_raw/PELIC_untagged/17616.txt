I remember Once when I was 8 years old I went with my father to the village where my all my family members were born except me to visit my grandfather. Actually because I have not ever see my grandfather before I was so excited to see him for the first time. When we got there my grandfather's nighbores told us that he was transfered last night to a hospital because he was suffering from heart attack. We went immediately to the hospital. Once we got there the physicians told us that he died. I will never forget my father's tears and that sad day. What the most thing in this story let me feel regret about not seeing my grandfather that we found a letter was addressed to me to telling me that he was so excited to see me too.
