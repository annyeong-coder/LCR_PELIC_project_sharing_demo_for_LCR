Two weeks ago I ought not to have moved from my apartment. I know it was a big mistake. My previous apartment was a very clean and very big. I might have found new one. I should not have talked to ANON_NAME_0 about my problem. She tried to help me. She ought not to have given me a lot of information. I was very thankful for her. Finally I should not have found new one. I will move next two weeks again.
