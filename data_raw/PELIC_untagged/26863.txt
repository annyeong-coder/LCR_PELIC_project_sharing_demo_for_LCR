ANON_NAME_0 Last Name writing 5S I have two reasons to learn English. First to be able to access any university in the United State. The second reason the English language in my country is not an advantage thing to help you to get a job anymore it is a requirement for almost any job. In order to learn English I have to find the best way to do it. And I decided to go to a place that I can learn English with native speakers. There were three options of countries one of which was the United States which my brother is studying there. The other choice was Australia which I have some relative living there. The last place was the United Kingdom and that because I thought at that time is the best place to learn English. At that time my brother had problem with his roommate and he did want to separate with him. Also he did not want to live the same experience again. Furthermore he was unable to pay for an apartment by himself. As a result he asked me to join him in Pittsburgh. At the beginning I was reluctant because I heard that the weather in Pittsburgh is fluctuated and the winter is very cold. In addition the climate is unpredictable. Another reason that I never heard about Pittsburgh before. Finally I decide to stay in Pittsburgh for one semester and try whether I can live here or not. So my brother found the ELI for me to start my program which was the strongest reason for me to stay in Pittsburgh for long time.
