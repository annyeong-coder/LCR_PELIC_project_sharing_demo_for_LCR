I met my friend Inho while I was studying at Hilman Library. He talked to me when he finished his homework. We talked for a long time but I didn't want to! He bothered me while I was doing my homework. When I finished my homework he asked me to go to the movie but it was too late so we decided not to ge. I was thinking that I wanted to go home when he said he wanted to have a dinner with me!
