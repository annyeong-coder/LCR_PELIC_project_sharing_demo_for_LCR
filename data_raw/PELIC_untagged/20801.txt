I think about three advantages of teaching young children business skills but also I have some disadvantages about that. First advantage it's opportunity to feel themself like adults. They play games including desicion about buy or sell something like businessmen. The second it's real life experience. The child can study during adolescence about adaptation to real problems like income. The third study business can develop thinking about the future. During his life child can decide which professionals he want to be. By study business skills he can decide maybe until his adolescence what he want to do. Although all advantages I think about disadvantage like difficult to explain the adult world. Business world is a tricky word and children are naive minds. They maybe reating for themselves a good image can later disappoint them. In conclusion young children can be teaching business skills but gradually teach according to the age and understanding.
