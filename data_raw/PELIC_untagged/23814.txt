Who is going to protect our country from other who intends to threat our security In history Korea had a tragedy that millions of people were killed due to the problem of ideology between the democracy and communism. At that time Korea didn't have an ability to protect ourselves from the sudden attack of the enemy. At the result of Korean War many people died without any reason and many soldiers including a lot of soldiers dispatched from the United Nation was disappeared. What an unhappy and miserable case! After Korean War we are still keeping two ideological systems that control and keep own system. We have no choice to establish our own self defense. To establish the self defense mandatory military service is inevitable. This is one of our four unavoidable duties. So all Korean men have to serve military service except for the special cases. For example if he is the one who support his family the government allows him to exempt this mandatory service. From the lesson of Korean War the government spends a lot of money to buy new weapons any to pay salary for soldiers. But if we don't serve this duty who is going to protect us from the enemy Maybe we can hire special soldiers who had a lot of experiences. But can you think that they really have a mind to sacrifice their lives It is not irrational that other people can protect us from the enemy. I think that it is to give up our responsibility. Even though we have many weapons with new technology if we don't have insufficient soldiers to control them it is useless. So I think that self defense should be done by ourselves with the royalty about our country. This idea is based on our terrible history that our people experienced. For sure if we don't have any enemy to threat us we don't need to spend our energy like this.
