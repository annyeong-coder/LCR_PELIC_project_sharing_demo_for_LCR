If I had big money through the lottery ext. First I'd like to go North Europe. Because I heard that there are many attractive places for example the mountain covered with un melting snow the white night in Finland Norway. I want to see the beautiful scape. I will take a rest for a month by climbing mountains and go sightseeing by train. Secondly I'm going to middle eastern. In this province there is so big dessert. I have been to pakistan and I thought this area was very fit to me! Even the traditional spicy food is very delicious! Other korean didn't like this food It was like my home country. I'm look forward to feeling again in a past time. But dessert is so spacious maybe I have to buy a jeep another car because I have big money! . Lastly I am going to see the english premier League very exciting soccer game . The ticket is worth almost 100 dollars! Only one ticket If I don't have enough money I can't see the match at all. Especially in the league there is a korean soccer player Park I'd like to see the his match really.
