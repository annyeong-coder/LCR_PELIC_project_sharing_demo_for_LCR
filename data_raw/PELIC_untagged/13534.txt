To the editor You stated that money spent on research is almost always a good investment even when the results of that research are controversial. However it can be very dangerous to the whole world if money is spent on any research that can bring negative effects. For example a controversial research recently is the research of stem cells. Nobody can sure about the result that the stem cell research can bring to our society. Moreover there is an example of dangerous investment which is dynamite that evoked the war. Thus your opinion you stated should be considered again and spending money on research carefully is needed. Sophie Student's Last Name Oct. 06 2008
