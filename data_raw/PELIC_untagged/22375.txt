Hi all I'm ANON_NAME_0 I was born in Mozambique and grew up there. I left my parents when I was 16 years old and entered the Medium Seminary. I have studied Philosopy and Theology at the St. Augustine Major Seminary and I became priest in 1996. Then in 1998 I moved to Italy where I did my PhD in Philosophy at the Pontifical Urbaniana Univerity 2003 and Master's Degree in Spiritual Theology at the Pontifical Gregorian University 2005 . Well I have been building this website for a while and I have written some interesting books to share my thougths with you. I began to be a resercher in 2006 and last year I was in Italy to present my speech at the international conference concerning the relevance of higher education in the context of globalization. I collected there stamps to show you on my website. I have been working so hard for a while in order to present you an interest novel after finishing the composition. I arrived in Pittsburgh on January 9th 2010 and began to attend English classes in the ELI at the University of Pittsburgh. Before starting English classes I did a placement test. I have been studying with my classmates from different countries.
