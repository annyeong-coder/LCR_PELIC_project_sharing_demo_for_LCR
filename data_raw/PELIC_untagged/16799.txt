I think that Achuar's eco tourism is potentially harming the environment because tourism urbanization poses potential hazards for the environment. In addition tourism threatens rare kinds of animals and plants. I think that many tourists are not aware of the tremendous history of the city. However tourism is having a dramatic effect on the economic growth of the country. We have to deal with environmental pollution arising from economic growth. We need to think about how to balance tourism and preserve the environment. Therefore it is important to develop controlled tourism so that nature is not destroyed by an abundance of visitors.
