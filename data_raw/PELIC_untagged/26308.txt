Who make our life a good Each country needs a strong army to get victory so a strong army is composed of soldiers who have enough power to fight the battes. They must have power and some mercy that is increase. When I see the soldier in the picture who is helping the children and he is smiling in front of them that the soldier makes me feel respect for him I feel secure and I feel that the soldier is fair. First respect is desired by everyone but should be increased for someone who is responsible for the protection of people. I think the soldier in the picture deserves that because he is standing whith children in spile of danger. He is wearing heavy clothing which is his military uniform however he is smiling and even though is smiling with children. He is ready which is clear from the way he cares his gun. Second feeling secure is the most important thing in the life. In general the security officers make us feel that. Security comes from the strong army capable of protecting its country. In the picture I notice the area is quiet the children feel reasured and the soldier is in control of the area. Fainaly soldiers should be fair with everyone always. They have a good relationship with people everywhere. When I see the picture I feel that. The soldier treats the children kindly. Others are watching him happily and I see satisfaction on their faces. In conclusion the working at an army is honorable. I can compare it with medicine and teaching. They might loses their life to make us survive so I respect soldiers. I feel secure in their presence and I feel they treat everyone fairly.
