Problem solution My country like the other countries in the third world has big problem with the transportation system. Our transportation system is mess. People and the government of my country should cooperate to solve this problem. There are two solutions that can be done to solve the transportation problem. The first solution the government should establish good infrastructures for the transportation system. It should buy new busses and it should provide bus stops every where because when people do not have special place for the busses to stop people cannot find bus easily. Transportation from city to city in our country is big problem because our cities are distributed on large region. The government must provide trains that connect between the main cities in our country. Also the government should provide subways at least in our capital city. In this time the mentioned solutions have the ability to fix the transportation system. Then in the future we can provide more options like providing online services to regulate the busses schedule and special number for each bus. The second solution the government and the people must work together to make the transportation system succeed. The government should encourage the people to take care of the transportation system. This includes the drivers and the people who rid the busses. The driver should take care of the bus that he is driving and we should provide rules for this when driver make some thing bad for the bus he must be punished. People ridding the busses should take care of the busses. They must not break or steal any thing. The government sholud educate the people to do this. In addition the riders should pay money when they want to rid. This money can be used to fix the busses when they break down. Transportation in my country is big problem. The people and the government have the responsibility to solve the transportation problem.
