On December twenty three two thousand nine I first time made capsule of my life. I putted into a smart phone such as HTC Aria a car and solar cell plane so I used the mush more huge bottle that was not normal glasses bottle and putted in underground of Presidential palace in Taiwan I want to open it in two thousand twenty . They have individual mean each item that I putted first was smart phone why did I choose it because smart phone involve many technology including a high quality glass for touch panel Li Cell battery it is a kind of batteries and software thin. I will compare future smart phone with old smart phone now we use . I want to know what kinds of technologies for design and produce future energy storage battery and I think future smart phone will thinner than I used. Future smart phone may be soft such as paper or leather. A car it was my second item there are four wheels for a car I think after fifty years ago future car could be fly in air and without wheel I want to show people who live in two thousand fifty my car use four wheels and made of plastic and it drive on road only. Now cars and planes main energy is fuel may be after ten years transportation such as cars and planes main energy is electricity. Third solar cell plane many countries government encourage factories and universities use solar cell plane but in fact solar cell plane does not produce much electricity it power ratio almost 30 percent after several years new solar cell planes have high power ratio. Time capsule is interesting idea but we need to make sure it would not be found out and broken and keep dry inside of container for time capsule.
