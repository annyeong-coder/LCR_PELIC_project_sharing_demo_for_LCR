If I was on an island I would take a knife because a knife would help me to protect myself from wild animals. Also a knife would serve to prepare meals. With a knife I could build a cabin to protect myself from the weather. A knife could be used to build a boat. Also a knife ought to be part of my basic equipment to survive on a desert island. If I chose to take a knife I would prolong my lifespan on an island where there are many challenges to overcome.
