The effects of obesity I often see many people of obesity after moving to the US from Korea. When I saw them they had some troubles in bending and moving. I know some people who are struggling with obesity. One of them is my husband. After he has become fat he has got some problems such as physical diseases and psychological trouble. First as a result of fat he gets physical diseases such as high blood pressure and hyperlipemia. When we married he had a normal weight. However he has gained his weight as time goes on and eventually he developed high blood pressure and hyperlipemia. As a result he takes medicine every day for those diseases. Next as a result of fat he gets psychological troubles such as an imperative conception. For example he always checks the amount of salt and calories when he buys sauces and some foods. Fortunately it is not very serious. In addition whenever I make dishes I always concern about the amount of salt I use. In conclusion as a result of obesity people are struggling with physical diseases and psychological troubles even though these are not so serious.
