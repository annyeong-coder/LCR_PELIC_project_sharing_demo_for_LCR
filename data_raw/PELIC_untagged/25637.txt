Global warming is said to be urgent issue for the environment many scholars and experts believe that the emission of carbon dioxide became the main culprit of it. I think cutting down the emission of the substance is very important issue because it causes the greenhouse effect by which an average temperature has continuously risen. The planet faces an environmental crisis such as melting glaciers in the Polar Regions and unexpected flood or drought. Many claim that countries including the U. S China and India which are accused of major producer of CO2 should regulate the emission of it.
