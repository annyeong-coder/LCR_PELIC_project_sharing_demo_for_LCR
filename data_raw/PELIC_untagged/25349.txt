How I came to Pittsburgh I order to study English abroad. I spent half a year searching for much information and asking many friends' advice. As a result I decided to go to Pittsburgh because it has famous buildings and fewer Asian people. I first had to decide what transport tool I wanted to take. So I booked my airline tickets and contacted the school and homestay. Then I applied for a visa and prepared to pack my baggage. I remembered that most of my friends told me they planned to study abroad and learn many things such as language and make friends and international views. So I surfed the internet and compared many language schools. My parents advised me to not go to a private school and find convenient transportation. Finally I decided to go to Pittsburgh because the bus is free. I booked my airline tickets. Because the airline raised the ticket price every week I booked the tickets that needed to have three transfers. I did this in order to save money. But I was exhausted after taking that trip that from Taiwan to LA then from LA to Chicago and finally from Chicago to Pittsburgh. I order to go to America I took a bus to Taipei city to get my VISA. Fortunately I got a VISA and packed a lot of clothes. On May 2 I took a plane to America. When I arrived America everything was fresh. I took transport tools such as airplane and bus. These tools are different from Taiwan. Moreover I am first taking a plane I get many new experiences. I hope I can take these transports to travel everywhere in America.
