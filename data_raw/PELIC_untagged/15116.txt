I was lucky to meet a nice lady while I was waiting for the bus to go back to the hotel in Orlando. I didn't know where to take the bus and which was the right one. The lady showed me the right bus station and pointed to a bus when it was approaching. I found out there were only three of us in the bus on the whole way back to our hotel. She told me that Epocot was another theme park she would love to go again while her husband was talking to the bus driver. She called me dear during the whole way back to hotel which made me feel warm. Angela the lady gave me her name and Email when I was getting off the bus because she wanted to be a friend of mine.
