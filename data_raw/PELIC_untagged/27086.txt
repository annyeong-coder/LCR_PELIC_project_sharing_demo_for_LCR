I repaired my laptop yesterday. It was really a complex work. Before I started to mend it I had been reading the manual carefully. After that I had understood the construction and position of different parts. I thought I had understood everything when I had finished reading the manual then I started to open the laptop's shell. Then I found I had been wrong I had not anticipated the complexity of the laptop although I just tried to clean the fan and exchange the hard disk. I had been finding the fan for a long time and at last I found it in a deep hole. With the help of an ingenious brush I had accessed the fan and after the cleaning the function of the fan had been enhanced greatly.
