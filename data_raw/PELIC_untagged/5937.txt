Every one in my country has stated to feel water shortage during summer time. In fact many of them stating complain the Ministry of Water either directly by writing a letter to them or by writing in the news paper whereas some of them talked directly to the King's open day to a public however most of these issues were solved by this way but the majority in the another hand is not . Now a days a bottle of water cost 1 SR but for the long terms it's cost more which is a big problem. Imagine that we as a big country produce oil to all over the world could not solve the water problem.
