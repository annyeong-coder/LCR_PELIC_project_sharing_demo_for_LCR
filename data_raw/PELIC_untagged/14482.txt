Hi ANON_NAME_0 You sent to me an e mail telling me that you will come to the USA for studying. Sounds good and here are some advice that could help you before your trip. First you should read about the American culture that would help you to understand American habits and there are bunch of web sites that might be helpful for you. Then you have to being a dictionary that would help you in your studies because here it's rare and if you found it it will be expensive. You shouldn't buy any electrical devices which you will need because here it is cheaper than there. Moreover since a credit card is very essential you ought to bring one that would help you in the beginning. You had better not bring any copy CDs because it's a big problem here and you would be in a trouble if you did. Finally my piece of advice to you is that you had better get the TOEFL score there is Saudi Arabia and work hard for it and get admitted to your University directly.
