In my culture there are a couple of table etiquett. For example the oldest start eating first before taking main dish othe memberds need to wait. We avoid to smack our lips while we have a meal also we do not hold our bowls which put rich soup into. Use your chopstics for side dishes and a spoon for rice and soup. Neither cross your chopstics nor across other person's chopstics while they are taking dishes from plates.
