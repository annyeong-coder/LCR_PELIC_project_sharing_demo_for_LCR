First she is short and fat and she has smooth long hair and fair skin on the other hand I am tall and slim and I have curly short hair and dark skin. In addation to the physical differences we also have a lot of behavioures Differences she is very calm person and she does not get nervous easy and She is very generous person if any one asks her to lend him money she will not Refuse his request if she has the money and she does not get angery if that person does return the money to her in the expected time . In contrast to me I am nervous and I get angery easy and I don't like to lend the to any person expect the one I trust and even if I lend money to some one I expect from him to return it back at the time and it upsets me if he doesn't . We also have different sleeping habits she prefer to go early to sleep and she can sleep in any circumstance even in noisy one she like to get early in the morning even in the week end And she can awake without using the alarm .
