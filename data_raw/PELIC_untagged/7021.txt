I want to introduce my first friend in the United States who is also my roommate now. We both came from Taiwan but she lived in the other city which is located in the middle part of Taiwan. We knew each other through a family web site which is set up for Taiwan students who study in Pittsburgh. At that time her first roommate who finished the class came back to Korea. My friend needed to find a new partner to share this apartment. I decided to move in this apartment whose location is very convenient and close to school. She took me to supermarket restaurant and stores which I didn't go to before. Sometimes she cooks dinner for us which are very delicious. These two months that goes fast we get along well. However at the end of this month we have to move out this apartment whose lease will end 3 weeks later. I believe we can still keep our friendship that can't change even we live in different place.
