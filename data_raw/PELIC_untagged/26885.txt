I have been reading The Da Vinci Code for three weeks but I never watched the movie adaptation which was directed by Ron Howard. Therefore I spent 3 hours watching The Da Vinci Code at Saturday night. The stars some of whom were French actors performed well. Especially Tom Hanks who stared a Harvard symbologist ANON_NAME_0 Langdon was professional. However the movie was not as detailed as the book which was written by Dan Brown. The movie scenes some of which were captured in many famous places such as Louvre Saint Sulpice and Rosslyn Chapel looked hasty. If I had not read the book I would not understand what the movie wanted to express. This movie was the worst adaptation which I have ever seen.
