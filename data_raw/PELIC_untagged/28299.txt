I grew up in the small city named Zawia which is 30 minutes faraway from the capital city of Libya where was located in the northern coast of Africa. I lived in the apartment where was near from my high school with my family then we moved when I was 15 years old to our own house where is locating near from my medical school. In my city we expect hot dry summer cold rainy winter windy dusty fall and greeny nice spring. Most of the people driving cars that are mostly Toyota or Honda. We have many shopping stores where we can buy our daily needs. The university to whom I studied medicine is 7th April University.
