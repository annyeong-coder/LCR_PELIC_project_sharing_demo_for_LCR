I think Kan ming would be a good roommate for me because we lead similer life. Time to get up and have dinner is same. His time to go to bed is irregular. He sometimes go to bed early and sometimes stay up to midnight. I also stay up late. If lifestyle should be similar trouble would seldom happen. His hobbhy is also similer tome. We like sports and music. It is easy to make good relationship with people who have same hobbys. But we have to study how to cook. Both of us can't cook.
