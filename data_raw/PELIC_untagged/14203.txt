This summer I made a lot of friends with some people who are completely different from me. In April I had been starting to study English in the United States until now. In the ELI there are a lot of people who are studying English from different countries. All of teachers who helped us when we had problems. And Lindsay who is younger than I am became a good friend. But she went back her country. Pittsburgh which is a very beautiful place. I went out all the time and I took a lot of pictures. Rob who is a teacher gives us a lot of activities. He's leading the trip what that sounds interesting. I think I won't forget in this time in my whole life.
