Marriage in Saudi Arabia has been ongoing as like our ancestors before. As we see the marriage has been changing in every culture except Saudi Arabia. I have talked to American guy when he has asked me about the marriage in Saudi Arabia and then I have told him that the marriage in Saudi Arabia is not like what you think. Because he thought that we can see each other before we married but in our customs that is not allowed but now are changing toward Islam way that we can see her by wearing Alhejab in her hair. That thing has been doing for just while when evolution has arrived to Saudi Arabia. By the way that Saudi Arabia is very big country and it has a big five provinces therefore in each area has own way in the marriage so. I am saying about the eastern area in my province which has that way I said. When I was in Michigan State I lived with Americans guys and they had been asking me a lot of questions about the marriage in Saudi Arabia. They were shocked when I had told them that we don't date girls in Saudi Arabia. Finally American has been asking me a lot since I came to the united states until now.
