I was in Barcelona's Airport when I met my boyfriend. My flight was cancelled and I was complaining with the Aserca Airline's manager when suddenly he also came over to complain for the same reason. Well we had to make arrangement for a new flight and we went to the same place Caracas . After that we had to wait four hour for the new flight and he invited me to drink a coffee. While we were waiting in the Cafeteria he asked me if I had boyfriend and I said Hey You go so fast . In between he was talking with me when his cell phone rang. As soon as he started to talk with he said Mom I met to the woman of my life and I didn't know what I had to do. I felt embarrassed about it so he changed his face and he smiled me then he told me that I was so pretty and he apologized for. Although we were getting on the airplane when I lost my high heels and he told me that I was his Cinderella oh! It was so funny. Finally inside the airplane we talked each other for a long time and he caught my heart. Later when we were in Caracas he invited to take a dinner together. Well while we were eating he wrote me a note that it said You want to be my Girlfriend and I said Yes . And now we have eight months with a great relationship.
