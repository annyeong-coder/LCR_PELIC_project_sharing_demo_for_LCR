It's my first time studying in the USA. I learned English with Korean teachers. And I usually studied reading and listening. Because of it I'm not good at speaking English. To improve my English skills I picked out the ELI program. Before I came to Pittsburgh I put up my semesters in Korea. In the ELI orientation I have a placement test. It's very good chance for me to try out my English. In the class it's hard to me that I have to speak a lot in every class. But teachers try to cheer me up and let me go on speaking. After the class I have homework which I have to hand in and it makes me to go over the class and keep on using English. On the other hand there is something I want to change. In classroom G 19A there is no blind on the window. I hope that someone hang up the blind before the spring break is over. I think it's very good to me that I can improve my English. It's little short to learn English but I can get many information about the USA. I will try to make up my grade and do my best in every class.
