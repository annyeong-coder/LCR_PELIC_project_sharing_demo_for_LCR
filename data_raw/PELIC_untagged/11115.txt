The paragraph will introduce my life habits whether there are any differences between Pittsburgh and Taiwan. First of all about my routine I went to sleep late in Taiwan because I often had a lot of work to do but I always go to bed early here. I think my life here is regular and normal and I feel my body is healthier than before. I never cooked except when I didn't have money in my country but now I cook two meals a day. I often sweep and clean up our apartment with my brothers here but I only helped my mother wash the dishes twice a month. Maybe I stayed at home much less but I always love and will love my mother. Second about my diet I drink a bottle of Coke once a day here but I didn't buy any soda in my country. Because the main of drink in Taiwan is fresh foam tea I never drank other kinds of drinks that are like soda. Also I liked to eat fruit before but I can't buy it easily now. The fruits in the U. S. A are more expensive than in Taiwan especially bananas. You could spend only 3 dollars for a bunch of bananas in my country but the price of the same bananas cost me around 6 dollars here. Finally I think these conversions of life habits influence me or other foreign people very much but I believe these habits will become the best of my experiences living abroad.
