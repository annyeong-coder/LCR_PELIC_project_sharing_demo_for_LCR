I don't agree that two heads are better than one. I know that nobody can do everything by her or himself every time. But sometimes some conflicts appear when people come together to think about something or make something if there is a no moderator or leader. When I was a student at university we sometimes worked on a term project with our friends. My first experience working with a group was really terrible. Because of everybody was confused I remember that we hadn't determined the topic of the project as the semester finished. Firstly somebody conflicted about subject. Because they didn't concur on choosing a suitable one. Also another students started to discuss about division of task. The important point was that at least two people had discussed about the same thing. Moreover even some people didn't want to get any responsibility. Yes it was a big project and may be one student couldn't it individually. But if there was a one student seek to get task individually for the each part of the project it had already been done. To sum up I think it's not good idea to work on something with people if the position or mission of the people isn't determined
