Take hotel White House Downtown Shop BBQ Everyone wants to have just trip with his friends. In fact I want to go to Washington Dc with my friends. First of all before we do anything we need to get a hotel room for our group. Then the next morning we want to see the White House to see it and meanwhile we want to take picture together there. Then on the same day we are going to go to Washington's downtown while we are downtown we want to eat Arabic food with my group. In the next day we are going to go the biggest mall in D. C. To shop I think it is on Elm ST. But I'm not sure when we arrive there I'll be sure. Last we'll go to a park which is near to our hotel to have a BBQ. In addition we want to go the park when make checkout from the hotel because we want to go back home when we finish the BBQ.
