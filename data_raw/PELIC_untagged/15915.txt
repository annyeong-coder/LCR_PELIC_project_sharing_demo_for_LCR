A We have just two hours to get something. Can we get all of necessary stuff in time B Well because of the time limit we have to make a list for them. A First of all we need some food right B Sure. And then we also might need some firewood because the temperature could become cold in the desert at night. A You are right! I didn't think about that. We should find some fresh water too. I think a bottle of water isn't enough for four days. B So we ought to find an oasis because we can find some animals and fresh water. Also there may be some trees nearby. A Okay. We must survive!
