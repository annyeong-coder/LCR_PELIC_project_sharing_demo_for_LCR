I agree with the opinion that insists on enacting the Model Code for Corporate Citizenship. Nowadays many corporations do not care about the public interest and environment. The most important thing for them seems pursuit of profits. In modern society corporations are personified as if they are independent characters. That is why corporations can pursue profits without considering their social responsibility. According to the text even though the leaders of corporations are decent and ethically good people the state laws have flaws that make corporations do harmful things. However the author said that corporations have sufficient potential to embrace human values if the citizens request them. Thus it is persuasive that our effort to make the Code clearly can control the bad behavior of corporations.
