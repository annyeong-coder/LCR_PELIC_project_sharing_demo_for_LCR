DESCRIPTION OF MY FLAG TURKISH FLAG 100 years ago there was a war in the Anotolian domain. Our leader Ataturk was a very brave and successful commander. He managed the army how it should be done. But unfortunatelly during the war there are a lot of died people like the same in all wars. The soil was covered with the the blood of soldiers who died in the war. That time the moon and the star light reflected to the image. Ataturk who is our leader saw this image and decided that this image should represent the Turkish Republic. One white moon and star on the red base is the description of our flag. Also there is a proof of it. The date of the war was the night of the Jupiter and the moon rarely stayed closed.
