When I was a middle school student I met my friend Hye rin in the science academy. But we didn't know each other. After an year while I was walking in the street of my village I met her again. But we just said hello to each other and went our way. It was a fortunate coincidence that we met again in classroom of my high school. We became a very close friend because we were living in the very close apartment and we were having a similar habit and personality. In high school day we met almost every day and we talked about everything. As a friend who spent adolescent together we knew each other very much. We made a plan for our future and experienced every thing together. While I was studying for university in other city we couldn't see often. But she always supported me. She is a friend like family. So she is important to me.
