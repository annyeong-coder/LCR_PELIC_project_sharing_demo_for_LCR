I met my friend Rodrigo four years ago. During that time I was majoring in Civil Engeneer and he was training to become a pilot. First impresion was horrible I thougth he was stupid and he thougt the same thing about me. But then we were knowing more and more about each other and we understood we had many things in common. We finished our studies at the same time last June. During those four years we were making a solid friendship and now I know he is my best friend and I'm sure this feeling is reciprocal.
