About my hometown My hometown is Kameoka in Japan. It is a small city near Kyoto. I had lived there for a long priod of time. Sometimes I disliked to live there another time I liked to live there. Kameoka is very rural area in Japan even now but it has been deveping gradually. When I was a child it took thirty mininutes to go to shool on foot. Our family bought daily food at the only shop near my house. There were a few clinic. People were alomost eagygoing. We didn't lock the door of our houses even in night time. I had never seen the peoplet who live on the roads. Now it has been becoming bigger and bigger as the bed town of Kyoto and Osaka which are big city. There are many supermarkets and shops. A highway road was constructed. We can take train more than twice per a hour. There are some clinics and dentists as much as I wonder to choose. Many travelers visit our city. They enjoy hot spring river boat riding citeseeing Trains. They can eat fresh food such as vegitables beef and so on.
