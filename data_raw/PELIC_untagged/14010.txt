A telemarketer waked me up last night at the begging I didn't want to pick up the phone but I did it anyway. When I knew he was a telemarketer I wanted to hang up the phone but I decided not to. He wanted me to sign up for a new phone plan he kept on talking about how great this new plan is so I asked him to hold on so I can figure the cost out. And I found out that it will cost me even more than what I am paying now. So I told him that I will think it over and I end it up the conversation and hanged up the phone
