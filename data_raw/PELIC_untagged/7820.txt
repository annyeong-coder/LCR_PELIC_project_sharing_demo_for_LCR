I have been listening to classical music since I was 20. I had a lot of chances to listen to classical music and drew a water color of the music scene since I was 10. But the best chance for me to learn about was fascinated by classical music with my professor when I was in college. He was a French teacher and an expert of music. For about seven months after moving to Pittsburgh I had no chance to go to concerts because I didn't know where the concert hall is and also I couldn't drive. This year I have gone to Heinz Hall several times. Surprisingly I found that the ticket's price is very cheaper than Japan's and I can get today's ticket easily. So I have been getting today's ticket that is a nice seat after finding it. I have been enjoying nice concerts in Pittsburgh since last December. Also when I was in Japan I went swimming twice a week. In Pittsburgh I have gone swimming once a week as a member of the YMCA in Sewickley. These days I have stopped going swimming because I have been studying English at the ELI.
