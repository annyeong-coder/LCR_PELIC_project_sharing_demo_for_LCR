The percentage of people who learned English as a second language is 51. 5 . China and India each have more English speakers than the United States. Based on the percentage English language has become the mother of all languages in our world. I am going to discuss English through three factors job education and communication. Nowadays especially in my country most of the jobs acquire English language. However there are some people that found jobs without learning English But with their college degrees only. On the other hand people who have college degrees and an English language have a better chance of getting jobs with high salary. For instance students who are planning to study college in the United States have to take English courses before going to the University. Also the Universities in the U. S have a longer history than the Universities in Saudi Arabia. Nowadays most of the education sources are in English. Although there are some effort to translate these sources to many other languages than English including Arabic language but learning English is still going to give a wide range of source. If you want to travel anywhere these days the only language used to communicate with foreigners is English. Most of the countries I traveled to where they don't speak Arabic and also don't speak English the only way to communicate with them are by English. Nowadays people have a trend towards doing business internationally and the only way to communicate with other foreign companies is by English. Ultimately Globalization plays a big role into making the English language the mother of all languages. So in order for anyone to be successful in any kind of field he has to have a good background in English so it would help him to be up to date to what's happening in the world. This is what would make any person cope with the world globalization.
