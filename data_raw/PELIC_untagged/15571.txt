Everybody in his team showed their support when they were with him in the hospital before the game and the coach refused to play the game but Franklin said that he wants the team to play. When Milwaukee player Franklin whose mother died before a game came to play in the game the coach understood his situation and he let him in. DeKalb high school demonstrated a good sense of sportsmanship in their game against Milwaukee Madison. The DeKalb coach showed a good behavior when he was arguing with the referee about the technical foul which could help his team to take the lead in the game. The DeKalb player McNeal made a good attitude when he didn't score the technical two points and he deserved the applause from everybody there. DeKalb didn't think about how much effort they spent to get to the match from their city and they understood Franklin desire to play in that game for relieving his sadness. I think the referee was right when he gave the DeKalb technical foul because this is the rule of the game. When the Milwaukee coach let Franklin who is not in the roster play in the game it meant drawing technical foul that could give the other team two extra points. I'm pretty sure that Franklin is a good person that's why everybody was beside him during his grief. If it had been another team instead of the DeKalb they would have seized the opportunity to beat a strong team like Milwaukee in such sad circumstances for them. I'm really wondering if it was a critical game would the DeKalb School behave like what they had done in that game
