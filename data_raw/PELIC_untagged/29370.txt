If I were born the opposite gender I wouldn't have gotten married so young. I might have had different friends. I could have played different sports. I would have bought and worn different clothes. If I were born a man I wouldn't use make up either. I couldn't be a mother if I were a man. If I were a man I might become a father if I were a man.
