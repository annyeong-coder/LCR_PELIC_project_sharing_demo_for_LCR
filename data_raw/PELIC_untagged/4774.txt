I met my best friends when I was approaching my master degree. At the very beginning I was doing my researching in Acadmia Sinica the central research facility in Taiwan however I did not agree the research directions with my previous advisor Dr. ANON_NAME_0. As a result I transferred to National Taiwan University to finish my master degree. I did not adapt quiet well while I was forced to switch my area of research. When I was suffering tow of my best friends reached their hands to me. They were not only listening to my complain but also help me doing research. Just like an old saying A friend in need is a friend indeed. At last we became more than best friends we are brothers. Finally thank God with their helps and patience I finally graduated from National Taiwan University in a quiet different research area.
