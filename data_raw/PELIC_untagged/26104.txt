At the first scene Homer was excited to drive kids to school because he has got new GPS for his car. Bart went to his class to find that Mrs. K will not be available for the whole week and all the 4 grade classes will be merged together. In the last row Bart had to share a desk with a girl called Niki. Meanwhile Lisa was frustrated because she got an F so she went to the school yard to surprise that everybody wanted to be her friend. After that the teacher came to Lisa to tell her that there was a mix up with her test and she got a triple A but nobody now wanted to talk to her. It seemed that Bart and Niki were getting along well with each other but Bart did not know if she liked him so he asked her father for help. As Homer was busy fixing Marge car he told Bart to ask grandpa who in turn told Bart to kiss the girl. Now Lisa was wondering why she could not be a high achiever and got accepted at the same time. She was depressed so she posted that in her blog to surprise that Michelle Obama came to her school to support her and tell everybody to be nice to her. Bart was playing with Niki when he tried to take grandpa advice and kiss her. Niki was very upset so her parents came to school the next day to meet with Marge and Homer. The school applied a new policy to prevent any physical contact and there was a demonstration of what Bart did to Niki so he felt guilty. Niki was hiding in Bart's locker and because she could not see him that way she kissed him. They were friends again until they were fighting on the school roof. Bart fall down and could not move. As the school prevented any kind of physical contact they left him on the floor until Niki showed up and do CPR to save him. The No Touch policy is not any more applied in the school but Bart is still confused about Niki who told him there are many things about women she will not tell.
