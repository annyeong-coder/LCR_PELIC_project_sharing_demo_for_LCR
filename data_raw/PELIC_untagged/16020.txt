Sheila Hi Carrie we have got to Desert Island next week. Carrie Really how long will we stay there Sheila It must be five weeks. Carrie That could be very hard time to us. I must bring a lot of items with me. Sheila You can not take a lot of items. We have to choose three itmes. Carrie Do you think what itmes we should take Sheila We had better take matches a knife and a flashlight. Carrie That is a great idea. We can make a fire with the matches. The flashlight must be a necessaries at night. We have got to use the knife to cut food. Otherwise we might use the knife once we are in dager.
