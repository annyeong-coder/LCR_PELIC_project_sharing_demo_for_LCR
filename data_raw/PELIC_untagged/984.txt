Someone may argue that natural resources play a significant role in the economy of a country. As far as we know the natural resources included agricultures vegetable fruit or timber minerals stones jewels or jades national gas navigable rivers seaports and airports and so forth that make many counties be rich like Saudi Arabia and South Africa. However I believe that education is more important to a nation's wealth than natural resources because the country consists of people. The development of human civilization originates in education that improves human resources. For example some countries like Japan and Singapore are poor in natural resources but they are still rich from their human resources. In addition the Chinese idiom says to cultivate trees it takes ten years to educate people it takes hundreds of years. So to educate the people government should establish a systematic education policy not only concentrate on the current advantages. Turnabout and Relevant quotation
