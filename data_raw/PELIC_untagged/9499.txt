The person I revere most is my father who is thought to be the most perseverant people in the world. My father is my role model for several reasons. First of all he is full of enthusiasm about his work and he barely takes a break except some big feasts such as our New Year that no one would go to work. It is assumed that working is his bread and butter but people around him would know that his job is his blood because my father built up his company from scratch and it is understood that he is such a workaholic and cherish his company as one of his own. Thus I have learned the persistent spirit from him which is considered to be the most benefit late in my life. However this is not the only esteem I respect him. Secondly my father is a go getter whose life had been fraught with hardship when he was young whom never gives up on pursuing his dreams of what he wanted to be even though it may seem impossible. I am being mentored that never says never and failure is the mother success. It is said that we can succeed at almost everything only if we put the amount of efforts. I was compelled by his endurance to become a better person and always maintain a positive attitude in my life. Third of all my father is very open minded I was supposed to follow his footsteps as my brother did who is being proud by my father sharing the burden of the company and family businesses. But he knows about my personality and thoughts well so I am encouraged to do whatever I wish to do such as studying abroad. I really appreciate my father that he abundantly supplies me anything I need and he has showed the great understanding of everything. Finally my father is my life guide because his qualities of perseverance endurance and open minded are showed that he is the coolest daddy in the world and I am glad to be worn in that family.
