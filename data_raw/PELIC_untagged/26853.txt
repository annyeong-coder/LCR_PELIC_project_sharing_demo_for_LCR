A movie named The Professional attracting me a lot is one of my favorite movie. This movie's leading role Jean Reno did a really good job during the story. He played a killer in the movie named Leon. The little girl named Mathilda rescued by Leon changed a lot at the end. Because Leon gave her a lot of family warm and made her happier than before. Jean Reno's perfect perform deeply expressing almost every audience. Luc Besson whom is the director of this movie got various rewards because of this movie. He is a significant success director admired by numerous people. His movies all of which are popular all over the world earning lots of money. Having lots money can not stop his work. His movie expected by his fans could give us a new surprise.
