The last time I saw a compassionate act was in my own country. While I was buying my weekly market in the grocery stores two hungry children were waiting us outside the store. Since we needed some help with the bags they deciding to give us a hand. Asking them if they were hungry my mom gave them a couple of coins. I thought that that act of mercy was appropriated but knowing that there are many children working for irresponsible adults on streets I decided to be more radical. While we were walking to our car in the parking lot I saw a cheap restaurant where nutritious breakfast were sold. Upon having seen that my mom and I had the idea of going there and buy some breakfast for those kids. As the children were having those free breakfasts we decided to wait in our car always looking at the children. Being afraid about the possibility that the children sold the food in order to get money to buy drugs we decided to stay watching them. After they had eating breakfast anxiously we realized that they weren't faking us. Having realized that we left the store indulgently. Driving back home I though we made a good act.
