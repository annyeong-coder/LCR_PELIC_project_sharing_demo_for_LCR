I don't like the second story due to many reasons. First It is scary story. Second It is unreal story. In addition the end of the story is very sad. Furthermore I think this story is not appropriate for children to read because they will learn bad things which may effect on them badly in the future. Finally I think this story should be a movie better than a story.
