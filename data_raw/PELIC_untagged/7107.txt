I've already bought the foods but I haven't put them on plates yet. I've already bought the stuff to bake the cake but I haven't baked it yet. I've already prepared some juices but I haven't yet prepared the wines. I've already cooked some pasta but I haven't cooked the rice yet. I've already cleaned the house but I haven't borrowed some chairs yet. I've picked out music already but I haven't yet borrowed the CD player.
