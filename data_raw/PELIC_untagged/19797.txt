The first thing you notice when you visit a new city is the differences between your home place and the new one especially in food. That exactly what happened to me when I arrived Pittsburgh. I went to a grocery store I was surprised of what I found out. In my home town I used to get a fresh vegetables but her in Pittsburgh almost they are not the prices and the variety of the vegetables are completely different.
