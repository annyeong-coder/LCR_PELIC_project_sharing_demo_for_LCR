While I was studying at medical school I met Sara . We met while we were reading for the pharmacology exam in the library of the school. From that time we usually read together. One day while we were chatting her cell phone rang and she was informed that her father died. From that day she decided to stop studying at school and no one could change her decision. She was my best friend and our relationship never exceeded the limit of friendship.
