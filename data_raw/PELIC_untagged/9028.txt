My son is a very cute boy. He is just 2 years old. He has a round head there are some extra short hair stand on his head. His eyes are triangle. The funniest thing he looks like that he dose not have chin. He is so lovely when he is smiling. Because his eyes change to two lines and he has two dimples. But his dimples are not in the cheek they are closed his mouth. In addition his nickname is strong so his body is very burly. He is taller than the average of same age guy and few sicknesses. Everyone said Oh it is a boy after they saw him. His skin is clean slick and stretchy. Any color fit him. So every clothes let him handsome. He always wins some praise when he goes to public. People like to say He is so cute. His charm is not just exterior and he has a self governed character. He likes to choose by himself. He has his idea about wear or buy. Once he wore a black cap. I did not know why because he liked white. He said because he wore black shoes. I was so amazed. He know how to matching and he is so young. Also he is decisive. He just needs one second to decide which he want is and never changes. His toys and books are all his choose and still accompany him. More important he do everything intently whether other one does anything he all does not care. Except I say Dining is coming. He runs to me immediately. I think he will be a scientist because above causes. Of course he has a lot of disadvantage but I love him every way include pleased angry sad and cry.
