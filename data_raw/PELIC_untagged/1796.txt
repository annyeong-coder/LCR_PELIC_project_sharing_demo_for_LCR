Two important area of my life are my family and my friends. I have a younger sister. If I hadn't been born my sister would have been bored. If I hadn't been born I couldn't have met my lovely highschool friends. We had gone through hard times together when we prepared the test for the colleges. If hadn't been born I couldn't have realized the importance of my family. If hadn't been born I wouldn't have bought some gifts for my family.
