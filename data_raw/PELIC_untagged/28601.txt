Famous means known about by many people in many places and popular means smoething liked by a lot of people while common means something happening often and to many people or in many places. I think Popular means everybody likes you and wants to be around you famous only means well known. For example Bill Gates Adolf Hitler and George W Bush are all famous but not popular. People like Angelina Jolie David Beckham and Bono are famous and popular. Common always belongs to or share by everyone in a society
