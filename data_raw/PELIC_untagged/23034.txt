I used to live in Saudi Arabia. I worked in Private company for two years. Also I attended to Aramco School to learn English. I used to play soccer three days per week. In those days I used to visit my grandfather every Friday in the hospital. Also I used to go to the beach every Thursday with my friends. I used to play video games and I used to eat a lot of sweets. But the best moments I missed it here was sit and talk with my family. Today I'm living in Pittsburgh and attending ELI in the University of Pittsburgh. ALso I'm Playing soccer every weekend in Cost Centre. I'm Living with my cousin and my friends. I'm studying hard here in Pittsburgh because I visit the library every day to do my homework and review my lessons. Here in Pittsburgh I find a lot of friends to assist me if I need any thing. Also ther are excellent teachers I've learned a lot from them.
