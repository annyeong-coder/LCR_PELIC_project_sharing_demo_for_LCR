There are a lot of things I had never done before I came to the U. S. First thing is that I had never driven a car. Also I had neither rent an apartment or paid a cell phone bill. Also I had never been in the experience of studying with men. Because when I was in my country it was not allowed for me to study with men. I have learned a lot of experiences when I came to the U. S. Such as how I become a responsible girl and do all my things by myself.
