Two head are better than one. I agree two head are better than one. I feel it ought to my experiences. I have friends in the ELI. We are from other country each other. Sometimes we meet any house of those friends and we have talk times. We met my home on the last Wednesday. I would like to serve some Korean foods for dinner. It was not easy because I had to make 5 servings. It was a lot of foods. My friends came my home early however they helped with my works. HJ washed vegetables and ANON_NAME_0 sliced it. Patty and I cooked. Aybala brought a handmade cake for desert so I didn't need to make a desert. We made dinner together and we were able to make dinner more easily. If I made dinner alone it was more difficult. That day we enjoyed meeting time and it will re main good memory for me. If we help each other it makes work more easily.
