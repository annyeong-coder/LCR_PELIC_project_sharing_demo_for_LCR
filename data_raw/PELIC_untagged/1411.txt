I visited LA in summer vacation of 1993. This is my fist time to take airplan so I was very happy ! My uncle lives here for a long time. I stayed this city for five days . During this week I went to many interesting places . I like this city a lot . Afterword I went to Disney land with my father we played inside all day and night . I bought some gifts and ate food in here . My dream came ture . Until today I still remember that I have been to Disney land . I talked by myself I will come back USA again . Finally I am studying in USA .
