Friend relationship is important to not only me but also all. Usually I meet many people by attending eli activities. I think It's the very good opportunities. I met many eli friends in front of G 58 at 10am yesterday. We left for the aviary. When we arrived at the aviary I saw many people around the aviary's entrance. While we were enjoying so many birds and penguins at an aquarium my sister went to a church on sunday morning. We took a picture together. Also I could feed a bird fortunately. After we went to downtown. While we were going to downtown I saw a baseball stadium. As soon as we arrived at oakland we went to italian restaurant. We talked about our activity. I had good a time with the eli friends yesterday.
