A feedlot is an intensive way for feeding beef cattle also known as a type of concentrated animal feeding operation CAFO . Beef livestock are arrayed in pens small enclosures for domestic animals after spending their first 2 3 years grazing on rangelands. A selective animal for a feedlot must weight about 650 pounds. During 3 4 months an animal should gain an extra 400 pounds. This 400 pounds is conformed mostly from fat but it also gives more juiciness in the final product. Harris Feeding Company 2006 noticed a production of 250 000 head of beef cattle per year in an area of 800 acres. It is considered the largest fully integrated beef operation in California with a production of 150 million pounds of beef making. Nowadays feedlots are the more advanced technique for producing beef meat. These businesses invest the biggest part of their budget in feeding instead of space and achieve a resulting product in half time as in traditional cattle farms. References Harris Ranch Beef Company.
