If we do not have to care about money I would like to spend a time everywhere in all of the world. First I will make a list where I want to see or know. And then I will take a airplane chicket of first class. What a comfortable trip by using a first class air seat! However if we are able to go everywhere it will not make sense to send much time. Therefore I will make plans for reasons to visit. For example I am interested in visiting museumm. Some paints who is Vermer in Holand are exibited in museum in Europe North America Middle Eastand do on. I can meet their famous paint all aver the world. I impressed by the paint that name is A girl with pearl earing . Second I would like to visit concert hall in all over the world. I know that there are many spatious hall for example Opera theatres Musical halls Ballet theatres and so on. Especially visiting different kind of hall makes me excited. Because I can listen the music which is performed many different performers. I can enjoy obvious assessment from their arts. If I do not care about money I can enjoy sight seeing forcusd on arts I can enjoy cultural differences.
