I watched a short video named Ken Robinson says schools kill creativity . He believes that every children has extraordinary ability but we can t keep their extraordinary school because of our education system. According to him our education all over the world is the same hierarchy. First one is mathematics and language second is humanity and the third one is other subject. None one mostly can t study what he or she wants because of this hierarchy. He support his idea some stories. Finally he said we have to be careful and in order to educate our children we use creativity wisely.
