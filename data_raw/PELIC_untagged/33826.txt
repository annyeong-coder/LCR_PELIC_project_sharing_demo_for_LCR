I have had a Bachelor's degree since 2009. I worked in my field for 6 months. After that I decided to become an aupair because I wanted to improve my English and travel in the USA. I have studied English for a long time. I have spent a great deal of money to study English in my country but it wasn't helpful because I didn't get to use it. My English didn't improve maybe because I never used to practice. I have been an aupair since 2010. I lived in Buffalo for 1 year. Since April of last year I have lived in Pittsburgh. I got a lot of good experiences while I was doing an aupair. I completed the aupair program in April 2012. Since then I have been study at the ELI because I want to improve more English skills. I have liked English since I have been studying here. I don't know how much my English has improved but I do know I like English more than before.
