If I were going to be shipwrecked near a deserted tropical island I take some fresh water because it is basic for life. Then I should take some fishing equipment because I need to eat. Later I choose some matches there are important for cooking and making fire. I should take a compass it is so essential to be oriented. Finally I take an ax because it help me to hunt some animals.
