While I lived here I found some similarities and differences between my hometown Bundang and Pittsburgh. There are 2 similarities such as the road and doves and there are 3 differences such as traffic whether and transportation. I want to talk about similarities between Bundang and Pittsburgh in this paragraph. First the road of both cities are almost same. Pittsburgh has boluvoled avenue and street. Likewise Bundang has similar system like that. Because of that I could find the direction and adjust in Pittsburgh. Second Pittsburgh has many doves on the road and Bundang does too. I hate to see doves on the road and I am afraid of them. I used to avoid to meet them in Bundang and I am doing same things in Pittsburgh. Although they have 2 similarities they have differences more than similarities. First the traffic system is different. In Pittsburgh we can't turn right on red light but in Bundang we can. Because of that I was a little confused but I am fine now. Second the whether is different. In Pittsburgh the temperature is approximately 34 oC. In contrast in Bundang the temperature is approximately 28 oC. So Pittsburgh is hotter than Bundang. Third Pittsburgh doesn't have subway system.
