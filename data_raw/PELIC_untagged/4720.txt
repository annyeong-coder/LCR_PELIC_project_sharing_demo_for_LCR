I met my friend Namie when I came into my room in the dorm. She was one of my roommates. We didn't know each other before. Only one reason that I chose this room because her exact name Anchalitta Yospimsarn is long. At first day of the semester I was very surprised because when I entered the room first time she was lying on the bed and she said Hi Jao! How are you Jao was her friend. That happend when I was a freshman. After the first year finished we moved out of the dorm. Three years later when I was a senior she became my roommate again. We spent almost all of the time together and that is why we have had a very close relationship since then.
