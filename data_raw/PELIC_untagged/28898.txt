My country is one of the Mediterranean countries. The Mediterranean diet is healthier than the American diet. Fat consumption is lower than the US food and it is not as bad as in the US food. Our food is more traditional than the American food. The food from the USA is less spicier than our food. The choice of fast food in my country is not as varied as in the USA. The services in the American's restaurants are as good as in my country. The American food is more expensive than our food and it is not as delicious as our traditional food.
