I hold that the Hikikomori is the most unusual because they set themself apart from others. They reject traditions and withdraw into their own claustrophobic world. I wonder that some of them might have claustrophilia. Moreover their existence makes other people uneasy. Indeed somebody wonder if the Hikidomori are mentally ill. Therefore I consider they are the most unusual.
