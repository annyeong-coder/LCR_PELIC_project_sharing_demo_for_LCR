Corporations are powerful institutions. They do not serve humanity well when their pursuit of profits leads to damaging strategies. They hurt the environment and violate human rights and the dignity of employees. They endanger public health and safety and otherwise weaken the welfare of communities. I agree this article. Corporation has absolutely power to influence human behavior. Corporation should have principles to express its power. In my case when I get a new job I should know the rule of corporation. From this rules I can adjudge this company has ethic or not. As long as I become part of a corporation partner I want to follow this rule not only help corporation to make a profit but also take responsibility protect environment.
