My apartment used to be really messy. I frequently forgot to put my books back after taking them out of the shelves and using them. In addition I did not have any hooks to hang up my clothes. Thus quite often I spread the clothes over my room. Furthermore I did not unveil curtains so they block sunlight away my room. However my room have picked up when I figured out information about Feng Shui in English class. I knew that keeping my room on good condition has great effect. Now I always try to keep my room in good condition such as I always put everything back after using them. I have bought a hooks to hang up my clothes. In addition I bought some bulbs to light up my room. Also I bought some trees and put them in my studying room. Now I feel very healthy and full of energy.
