TOPIC DRAWING A PICTURE One of the things that I have been successful at is drawing a picture. First I contributed to my success at drawing a picture by studying the fine arts for many years. For example I have studied the fine arts while in a University and in a graduate school for 6 years. The Second thing that contributed to my success at drawing a picture was that I have loved Henry Matisse's picture since I stared drawing a picture. I studied his arts and his life. When I studied him and his art then I could see that his arts were masterpiece and I could feel comfortable and beautiful. So I wrote a master's thesis about Henry Matisse. As a result his arts had influence on my arts and I think it is what contributed to my success at drawing a picture. The final thing that contributed to my success at drawing a picture was that I had a good fine arts teacher. He was a passionate artist. He used multimedia in his arts. I studied computer graphics and I learned to be passionate about arts from him and I became passionate about drawing a picture then I won the first prize. He helped me to become a better fine artist.
