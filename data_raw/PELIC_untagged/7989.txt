After from books having read a lot of stories which talked about how famous people overcame their hard time before they succeeded I thought those all seemed like fictions which had never happened in the real world especially not easy to be found around average people until I knew the person who was my boss when I worked in Taiwan. I was so surprised by his suffering during his growth. His stories could be written as a series of novels which are full of happiness and difficulty.
