When I was in university I met my friend whose name is ANON_NAME_0 Gil. He lived in Mo ran where was near to my house. Then we had the same majors that ware management and physical eduation and that why I could hang out with him a whole day. Beside he had the unique aspect of character that I also had. Therefore we became best friends. I already knew that he has only his mother and a little sister who was 20 years old at that time when was in 2004. At the last of 2004 his sister got married in In Cheon where is located in the west of Southern Korea. However I missed wedding ceremony when was started at 1 o'clock becasue I was on terrible traffic jam even though I was trying to prepare some event in order to go there. After wedding ceremony I arrived at there where was in wedding hall and I said him that I was so sorry. Despite of my mistake that I overslept actually he forgave me. I did not need to speak of our friendship. After all of things I picked him up and we went to my favorite restaurent where has a good chef whose ability was very famous in cook fields. Accordingly we had delicious foods and we had good time.
