A team of economists and physicists invent a new theory by which developing countries can improve their economical situation. The main idea is that countries which export some products could export successfully other products closely related to the products they are already exporting. To apply their theory they made an electronic network representing the products and if this products are too much related to each other or not. Finally the team proposed that this theory can help developing and poor countries how to flourish.
