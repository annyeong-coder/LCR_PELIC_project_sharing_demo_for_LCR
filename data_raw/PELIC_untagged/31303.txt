Five yeas ago my family lived in hometown. Since then I and my sister have lived in another city. Therefore we can't frequently meet. Four years ago my mother has a job. Since then she has stopped the work. Now she's enjoying her life. Two years ago my sister was a student. Since then she has gotten a job. I'm happy that because sometimes she give me pocket money.
