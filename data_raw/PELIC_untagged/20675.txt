UNESCO United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization is an organization that concern about the value of global culture and environment. It established world heritage campaign in 1972 because it wanted to protect the ancient Abu Simbel Egyptian temples from flood because of building dam. Not only protected the temples from flood but it also raise money from other countries to preserve them. It indicated that people around the world want to conserve world heritage. In order to select world heritage sites UNESCO categorize them into 10 categories which six of them represent human value and culture so the other four represent natural environment. The processes to be listed in the world heritage site are a country owned site submitted paper work and then the committee will send specialized nongovernmental organization International Council on Monuments and Sites ICOMOS and the World Conservation Union IUCN to evaluate this site. Having been listed into world heritage site countries owned site have to protect their heritage. Otherwise UNESCO will remove them from the list and won't give owner the money to assist preserving.
