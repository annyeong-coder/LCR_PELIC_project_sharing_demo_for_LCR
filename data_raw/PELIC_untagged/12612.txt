In my living room there are a desk two chairs a shelf an audio system a sofa and many lamps. The desk on which my son sometimes plays is very strong and ivory. A chair that is covered with leather is worn and has made a hole in the corner. A shelf on which my books about programming are put is located on a corner where is close to the entrance. My friend who moved to St Louis gave me an audio system which is broken. I usually sleep on the sofa which is ivory. A lamp whose a 250 watt bulb is very expensive is very bright.
