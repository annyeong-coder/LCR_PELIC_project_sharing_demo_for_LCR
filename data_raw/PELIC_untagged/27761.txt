Types of Friends I Have When I was child my father taught me how could I recognize and appreciate different kinds of people. I met and worked with many types of people. It is important to select the right people so that one could have the correct friends. So I classify them according to how well I know them and how they know me. There are three types of friends friends who are good acquaintance friends who I know fairly and closest friends. The first type of friends I called them occasional friends . There a few things that I knew about them such as their names and some of basic facts. Usually I meet these types of friends in school at work in the gym or anywhere else I might be. Often I wouldn't mind having a cup of coffee with them especially if I have time. I normally don't miss this type of friends if they left elsewhere and I always wish good for them. The second type of friends who are I know them fairly well but I wouldn't be interested in having lunch or dinner with them alone. Often I meet this type of friends when I meet some of my closest friends. For instance some of closest friends of mine brought their friends if I have small party. I usually talk with this type of people in general topics and I don't keep in touch with them. The third type of friends is the closest friends in my life. I classified them as friends who offer different kinds of support rather than lovers brothers or parents. In addition closest friends are there when I need them and they always let their closest friends a priority. This kind of friends who can I trust and depend on no matter what. In conclusion friends are important and we must have friends because we are social creatures. We always surround by friends who are good acquaintances friends who we know fairly well and closest friends. I guess I have many those types of people who fit into these categories.
