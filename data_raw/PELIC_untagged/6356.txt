When I was senior high school age I was very sick. I did not know what was happen with my health. I lost my weight although I ate a lot. The wound on my skin did not get over very well. I felt so tired every day. Although there was some thing wrong with my immune system I did not tell my parents and see a doctor. Finally I got over from this illenss peroid by taking vitamins every day. The sick almost persisted a year. That was very terrible time to me.
