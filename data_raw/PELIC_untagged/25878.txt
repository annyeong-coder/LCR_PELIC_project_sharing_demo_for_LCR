Success in every profession requires many skills and qualifications. For example my profession as a teacher assistant in a university needs many skills to reach such a high position because I deal with managers colleagues and students. In order to achieve my goals I have to develop my academic technical and communication skills. Actually improving myself academically is a very crucial aspect in my profession. I have to complete my graduate studies by getting my master's and Ph. D. In order to gain knowledge and to be an expert in my field. However a high position job will not be achieved unless I have a Ph. D. Developing my academic skills will make me a well educated person and ensure a high position for me. In addition to academic skills technical ones are required too. We use technology in many aspects of life. As a teacher I use computers the Internet and language lab in teaching. I prepare my lesson in computer and present it to my students by using PowerPoint slides presentation. Also I keep in touch with them via e mail. Using language lab is complicated and needs a special skill to deal with its devices. Actually improving myself technically will guarantee having the needed skills to deal with technology positively. Finally communication skills are a very important aspect in my personality that must be developed. That is because I deal with different people during work hours and even outside the range of university. When I talk with managers I need to speak with them in an official manner and this requires a very special skill otherwise because of the authority they have they will not going to hire me for a higher level job. Besides I deal with colleagues and students constantly. I have to make sure that my ideas have reached to them. In conclusion every job requires different skills and qualifications. Success in such a profession means that we have to develop our skills and acquire new ones. . . .
