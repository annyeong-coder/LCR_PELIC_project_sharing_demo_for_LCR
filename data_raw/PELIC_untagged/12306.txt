Mobile phones 'harm blood cells' Many researches reveal that there is hazard effect of the cell phone on the blob cells. Scientists have said Mobile phone radiation may damage cells by increasing the forces they exert on each other . Katie Daniel deputy editor of the journal Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics said the finding was important. It highlights the idea that electromagnetic radiation might act on cells by affecting the attractive forces between them rather than simply causing heat damage to tissue she said BBC news 2008 . But she said the model was extremely simple and may not apply to larger numbers of cells. It needs to be tested experimentally she said. There is presently no evidence of cancer or any other serious health effect. It is so far so good but we are in early days of course.
