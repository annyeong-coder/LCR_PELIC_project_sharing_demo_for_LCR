When Yolanda's mother saw her daughter standing at the podium she thought it was inevitable that Yolanda would be a poet one day since she had the ability to draw audiences at the age of three. She didn't manipulate Yolanda to write poems because she wanted her daughter to be famous as well as be happy. She was satisfied with Yolanda's decision which was to be a poet again after her life had fluctuated from single to married from divorced to having a lover. Although the mother didn't know why Yolanda had the passion to write poems again she was always there as a fan of her daughter's poem. Attributing to her mother's consistent support Yolanda transformed from a poem lover to a really poet successfully.
