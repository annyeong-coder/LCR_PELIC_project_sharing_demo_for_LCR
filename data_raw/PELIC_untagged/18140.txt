My favorite memory is traveling with my relative at Pookradeung in My country. Pookradeung where there are many activities to do. We had to hike from bottom into the top of mountain and it took time approximately five hours. We were tired and rest many times. While we felt discouraged we saw very old woman were walking through us. Old women whom I saw encouraged us to keep on. I remember at that time when I came to the top of the mountain I was very proud and feel good. Moreover we had to ride bicycle into my camp. After we pitched my tents we asked staff whose bicycle I rode in order to rent and rode it to waterfall. In addition we got up at five o'clock in the morning and went to see sunrise. It was very beautiful view which I have never seen before. We spent our time at Pookradeung only two days but it will be in my memory forever.
