Before coming to USA I planned to take English classes at the ELI. When passing the placement test I started to study. Taking some classes at 3th and 4th level at first somestr I felt that I am in the right place to improve my English. Having studied second somestr at here I take classes at 4th and 5th now. I feel that my English is improving and it makes me happy. When completing English courses I am planing to take certificate classes about law. After completing that course I am planning to get my master degree but I haven't decided yet. While studying and living in USA I am following the agenda in my country like reading and watching the news as well. When feeling my English is good enough to use it for my business life I will go back to my home country Turkey. Not feeling ok about it I might stay a little bit longer.
