There are many ways to do a Self examination. You may take an English test such as a TOEFL to see how good you are. You may ask your friends teachers or elders to tell you what they think about you in order to get to know yourself better. Moreover teaching someone else is often a good way of a self examination. If you have a chance to teach someone else you may learn more about yourself. A few years ago I happened to teach French grammar to my friend. Until then I thought that I understood it very well though I might have needed to refresh my memory. Furthermore I had to memorize what I was going to teach. While giving her the lesson I realized that I did not fully understand some parts of French grammars. Thus it was a very good method to do a self examination of my knowledge of grammar. Another experience is that lately I taught my friend how to drive a car. It was quite frightening. I ended up finding out the fact that I had bad driving habits. While instructing my friend's driving I had to show her the good and safe way of driving. Then I came to see that I actually did not drive that way. That was really a good opportunity to see my own problems and correct them. Some may consider a self examination unnecessary or have not even considered it for self improvement. However if you teach others you have a chance to know yourself better and as a result you will improve yourself.
