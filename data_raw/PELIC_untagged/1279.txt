Personal Success A Korean National Team Swimmer I was a swimmer for 15 years and I was a korean national team swimmer for 3 years. I began swimming in 1988 and I was 8 years old at that time. My hope was to be a national team swimmer. However when I was 14 years old I knew that I wasn't better than other swimmers because I had never won a competition until then. It was true I didn't have a special talent for swimming. Therefore I thought I needed hard training to be a national team swimmer. I used to swim for 4 hours a day. My coach in Korea asked me to swim harder. Even I had to swim in a cold pool in the early morning as soon as I got up. I hated that but the harder I trained the better I swam. Finally I overcame all training and I could be a national team swimmer.
