I'm ANON_NAME_0 Mealla. I've been working in this website for some time now. The purpose of this is to introduce myself in the web. Lately I've been doing some other activities so I haven't actualized my profile. However almost nothing has changed. I'm still going to Pitt every day but I haven't been going to the Petersen because I got sick last weekend. Besides that I've included some new photos of me and my ski trip last Friday. I will be writing more about me next week. See ya!!
