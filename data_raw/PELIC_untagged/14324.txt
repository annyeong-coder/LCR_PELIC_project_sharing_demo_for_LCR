When I get back to Korea I will hang out with my friends. If I have a lot of money I will buy something what I want. Unless I study about my major I will not make money. In case it rains tomorrow I will buy an umbrella. Because I want to make bunch of money I will try to challenge new things. After I take some rest in Korea I will go to travel. As soon as I get in Korea I will look for my family in the airport. Once I go to the park I will do exercise. Before I leave the U. S. I will go to travel with my friend. Although I have an enough time I want to travel in the U. S.
