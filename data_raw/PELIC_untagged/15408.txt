I like to do many things alone. With out any help from any one. So I tend to be an introvert person. Because the introvert is a person who is more active alone. Most of my decisions are based on reasons and facts. So I'm absolutely a thinker. Because A thinker is a person whose decisions are based on logic. But in some cases I tend to be a feeler because. I'm flexible and that fits with the perceiver personality. Because perceivers are persons who like to keep their options open.
