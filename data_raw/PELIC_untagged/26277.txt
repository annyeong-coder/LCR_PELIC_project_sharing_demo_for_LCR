Learning English Learning English one of my goals that I want to reach in my life. Thus I decided to learn English for many reason such as studies. For example I decided to study at the university for a bachelor degree. Having a good job. Because of many jobs in my country required TOEFL or IELTS. And communication with the foreign people. For example If I speak English very well I wouldn't get myself in troubles.
