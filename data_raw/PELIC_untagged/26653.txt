I come from Taiwan. And I'm 24 year old. Now I am taking classes in ELI and learning English to prepare to attend grad school. On holiday I often go shopping with my friends. Sometimes I play basketball with my classmates. I used to play volleyball when I was a college student but now I have no time to play.
