I happened to see the intersection accident on my way home about five years ago. The rider of the motorbike was hit by the car. He was riding his motorbike on the main road. On the other hand the car was stopped over the stop line on the minor road at the red traffic light. Just after the traffic signal for the minor road turned blue the car rushed into the intersection. At that time the motorbike was passing in the intersection. The motorbike was hit by the car. The rider of the motorbike was jumped into the air and dropped on the hard ground. He got up once but soon fell down. After that he didn't move at all. The police and ambulance were called. I heard that the car driver said to the police that his car hadn't been crossed the stop line and had entered into the intersection at the blue traffic light. He insisted his innocent. I was frightened at the accident. Many people have been killed by traffic accidents since people began to use their own car frequently.
