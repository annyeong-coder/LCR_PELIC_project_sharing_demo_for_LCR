I read an article named Is Marathon Running Bad for the Heart and it's talking about running for long distances and heart diseases. People usually think marathoners have good exercises so that they are healthy. However after Mr. True died of a heart attack during trail run people wonder about whether marathon training damaged heart muscles. Scientists are also interested in relative risks but because of lack of available data there is no conclusion. Nevertheless researchers turned to news reports which have headlines in such things to gather numbers in fatalities. According to study it shows that the death rate is remained in the past decade even participation is increased and heart problems occupied the most part of death causes. The conclusion for the study is that marathon is safe for most runners but not for people in heart problems. Another study says people who have cardiac arrests and easy affected are around age of 42. Dr. ANON_NAME_0 who is not only a study leader but marathon runner states that the findings enhance what we already knew. He says running usually decrease the heart disease risk but there are many causes related to heart disease that running cannot prevent. Until now it's hard to know whether running for long distances contribute to Mr. Trues' death. However a small study shows that there is an unusual plaque in the heart usually developed in older male marathoners and former Olympians. After all Dr. ANON_NAME_0 states that running is not for good health but enjoyable.
