Flow' is a state that can absorb to task completely without any time limit. I experienced it last year when I was in the practice period. I had to go to the middle school and teach middle school students. It was a required program for every student whose major is education. In my case I had to teach Korean literature to eighth grade students. I had a month to prepare the lessons. During one month I tried to find the way how I can make students be interested in the lessons. It was difficult because some of the students didn't like literature at all and I was not a regular teacher in school. For the lessons I spent time with them as long as I can and tried to get to know them more. And I had to think about most effective teaching materials. Finally I complete my lessons successfully. During these processes I showed my creativity entirely. Although it was really hard but I cannot feel any difficulty because it was my favorite work and I really expected the lessons. It was a great time for me. Stimulating students to feel 'flow' is important because it makes students exhibit their best while they feel happy. Through this students can find what they can do and how they can lead their work by their own creative way. Teachers can provide this kind of opportunities to students. However Students might not be in the state of 'flow' in every work that they have to do. Therefore teachers should know their students well and plan tasks that may encourage each student effectively. Of course teachers cannot make every students be in the 'flow'. Instead of it teachers can help students to find their potential and the proper task that makes student be in the 'flow'. Teachers can help them but falling into the flow depends on students.
