After spending my Spring break studying for the GRE I made a reservation to take it on last Wednesday which was a general bomb threat received for cathedral of learning. Prometric Center which is located in the first floor of the cathedral of learning is the center I selected. When I was waiting for the bus I received the message told me that the building will evacuated until unknown time. I understand that under no circumstances do I allowed to enter the test center until get allowance from the police. When I arrived I was surprised because there were many students on the area around the building. At that day I knew how huge the University of Pittsburgh students is. After waiting for an hour on the sunny day we were allowed to entire the building. Only when we got the permission did we have entered the building. Upon arriving to the test center I checked in and started my test. When I was in the second section the fire alarm had been started. What that meant is we should evacuate the building immediately. The fact that we will go outside again is frustrated. What was disappointed is interrupted my test while I was doing it. Definitely that will affect my score. After waiting some time I was allowed to complete my test. The fact is I was doing my test and waiting to a new interruption. I was disrupted so my score was not good. The helpful that is the administrator of the center create a report helping me to reschedule the test again or refund my money. Finally I don't know whether the main center will accept my order or not. Not only is money the problem but also their time regulation because I should wait 60 days until they allow me to take the test again. So I hope they will consider my reasons and cancel this test to allow me to take it again as soon as possible.
