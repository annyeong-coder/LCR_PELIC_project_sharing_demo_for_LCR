MY UNCLES My uncles my mother's brothers are very similar. One of them is named Kamal and another one is named Samear. First the two brothers look exactly alike. They are identical twins. Kamal is the same height as Samear. Both Kamal's eyes and Samear's eyes are brown. Another similarity between the two brothers is their hair black and short. In addition Kamal is married and so is Samear. Samear has a house and Kamal has too. Like Kamal Samear lives in Tripoli Libya. Kamal and Samear have many things in common. My uncles my mother's brothers are different in some things. First of all they have different jobs. Samear has fewer jobs than Kamal. Samear is an electrical engineer. On the other hand Kamal is a teacher. Although Kamal is also a merchant Samear is not. It means Kamal's mind is more a mind for business. Samear speaks the English language better than Kamal. In addition Kamal has more kids than Samear. Samear has two daughters. However Kamal hasn't any daughters. Also Samear's car is more expensive than Kamal's car. Kamal's house is less expensive than Samear's house. Samear's house is bigger than Kamal's house but Kamal's house is taller than Samear's house. Finally Samear's personality is different from Kamal's personality. Unlike Samear Kamal is quiet. My mother's brothers are not equal in all things.
