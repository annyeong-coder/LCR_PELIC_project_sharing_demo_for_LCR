My trip to Orlando was unbelievable experience that I will never forget. Never I could explore fun and entertainment had I not went to this trip. Staying there for one week I visited all parks of Disney world all of which I like. Traveling by car we crossed over several states such as Virginia Gorgia South and North ANON_NAME_0 all of which looked amazing when they stated to emerged on our way. Even though traveling by car was not simple task and uncomfortable the group I was accompanied by mad it so fun and easy. Moreover the fact that we are heading Disney world made the 14 hours trip worthy. Not only did we play games in parks but also we watched many kinds of shows and enjoyed different kinds of food such as sea food. What surprised me about seeing disney characters some of whom were my best since I was a little girl brought some sweet childhood feelings that I can't explain. On the other hands The fact that I am watching shows that exhibited in parks without my family made me shed a tear. Only when I was shopping for gifts for my family did I feel relieve. What really surprised me that the phrase I read in the gate of Magic Kingdom in the first day of visiting park was so true at the end of the trip Let The Memories Begin! .
