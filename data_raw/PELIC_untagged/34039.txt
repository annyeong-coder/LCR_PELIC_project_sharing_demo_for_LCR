I introduce my ideal home to you quickly. This house is located on a peaceful place and my neighbors are very friendly. When you come to my house you see a large front yard where grasses were cut shortly and a pretty swing at first. After you go through the front yard there is my house which is built of white and light brown wood. As soon as you open the front door my dog will approach to you. But you do not worry about her because her manner is absolutely perfect. She has never barked loudly. After that you can check all rooms. When you check my rooms you will be aware of the brightness. Because almost all rooms have really large windows. I am totally satisfied with my house. What do you think about my house
