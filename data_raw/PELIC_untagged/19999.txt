Android Apocalypse is a movie I don't like which is about humans and robots that looks like humans called android. Jute was a human criminal who were handcuffed together with DEECEE a defective android. They were attacked by the flying fighter modules while they are on their way from the barren wasteland to a prison. Odds were against them where the entire fate of mankind's existence was depending on their survival
