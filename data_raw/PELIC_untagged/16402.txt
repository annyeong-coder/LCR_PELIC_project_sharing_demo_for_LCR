When it comes to food I can not remember the exact steps and consequences of making perfect cook. However my mother has taught me three consecutive steps boiling the water then adding the main constituents and finally adding the spies. The initial step in the whole process begins by boiling an adequate amount of water. This can be done by applying a medium sized metallic jar on the gas apparatus. This can process can lasts from 15 to 20 minutes. Once the water started boiling the next step will takes place. This step involves adding the basic components of the meal. In this step we put the tomato pasta first and then we can add the other components which includes the oil meat salt different kinds of vegetables optional and the onion respectively. After putting these gradients the jar should be closed for another half an hour. Now the cook is almost ready all one can do in this stage is adding spics and adjusting the salt. Finally reduce the heat for the following 5 minutes for the final meal to be ready. To sum up. There are three main steps in order to prepare a delicious meal. These include the initial step called boiling the intermediate step adding the main constituents and finally the last stage adjustment phase .
