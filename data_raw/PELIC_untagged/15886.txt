In my opinion anyone can create art. It does not matter if you are a trained artist or an ordinary person. There is always a piece of art inside each individual. For example when a child builds a sand castle by using his simple beach tools he creates an art in his way. On other hand it is better to get some training to improve the creation. So creating art inspires people who have passion on art.
