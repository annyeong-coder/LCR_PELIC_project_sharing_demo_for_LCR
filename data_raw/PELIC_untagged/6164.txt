I live in an apartment with my parents. We have two badrooms one is big and the other one is little bit small. I live in that small room. The room always cheers me up when I tired and need a rest. Actually I'm a neat person so I always clean up my badroom. Sometimes the bad weather let me down but it's OK. Because I have my badroom I can change into my condition from bad to nice.
