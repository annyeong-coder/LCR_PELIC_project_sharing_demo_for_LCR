If you know how to cook you can cook everything what you like to eat and also can modify the taste as your wish. When you move to a new country you don't need to worry about how to find the restaurant. Above are the advantages for me to learn how to cook. However if you know how to cook maybe you will be asked to cook for someone who don't know how to cook even you don't want to cook at that time. This is my sister in law's complain. Ha Ha. . . And I also agree this is the disadvantage of learning how to cook.
