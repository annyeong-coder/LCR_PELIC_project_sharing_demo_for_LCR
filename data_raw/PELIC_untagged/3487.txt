To begin a new life you SHOULD change your bad habits. First you MAY do exercise at least once a week. Second you HAD BETTER NOT smoke a lot. Finally you OUGHT TO control your mood. Then you HAVE TO find a job as soon as possible for you have to raise your children and take care of your family. When you restart to work you MUST NOT be late or you MIGHT lost your job again. Anyway cheer up and work hard for a whole new life.
