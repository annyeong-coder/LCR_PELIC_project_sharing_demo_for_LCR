Hi readers I am ANON_NAME_0 I'm from Saudi Arabia. I've been living in Pittsburgh for 8 months. I grew up in a small town and I also lived in big cities there. My favorite sport is soccer. Right now I'm involved in soccer championship with my team. This week I've played one game and I've another game after two days. Last semester I played with the ELI team but we lost the championship. Since then I've been training. I hope that we'll be the winner this semester.
