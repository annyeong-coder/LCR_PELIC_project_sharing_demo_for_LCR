I love to eat lunch in Oishii bento in Pittsburgh. First of all their food is very delicious. You can eat Japanese and Korean style food at this place. The reason I love here is that I can eat my country food whenever I think my home country. Especially my favorite menu is Spicy pork bulgogi bowl and Katsu don among many kinds of food. In addition the price of food here is very reasonable. The cost is approximately between 5. 75 And 8. 25. It is a good price to me. Also you need not give a tip because you serve it by yourself like McDonald. Third it is near to the Cathedral Learning building where I study. It is located in 119 Oakland Avenue. So it just takes about 5 minutes by walk. Finally it is very convenient to take out. For example I order menus by making a call in advance and pick up the food. In my case I have a 5 month old baby. So I should come back home to feed my baby as soon as I finish my classes. I often take out this food and eat in my home with my husband. Therefore Oishii bento is my favorite place to eat lunch in Pittsburgh.
