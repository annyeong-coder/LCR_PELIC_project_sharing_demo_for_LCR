I do many things before I start to write and I like a suitable environment. For example I clean the space of my room. Also I clean the surface of the desk. Because I like a clean environment. I like a desk on homework or a soft chair when I read book. Also I turn off the music or TV or any kind of sounds because I usually like a quiet environment and warm room for writing. And then I then do this thinking I think an outline I start writing. But sometimes I change my thinking. But before writing I improve my vocabulary by reading the new words several times.
