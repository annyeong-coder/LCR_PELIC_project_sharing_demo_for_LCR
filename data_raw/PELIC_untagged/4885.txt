We met when we went to high school. She was sining songs and I was taking with friend in the class. That time she learned singing songs. Our teacher wanted us to sit together. We lived same apartment house. We very closed to each other. We were studying everyday after finished class. Some time we slept together. Now we still close friend and fewdays ago we were taking on the phone.
