Things that I wanted to do in Pittsburgh when I arrived were to take a small trip around Pittsburgh and to speak with people in English. About taking the trip I've been to falling water idle wild park Grove City Allegheny forest and a lot of state parks. My family has had a lot of fun before. But we haven't gone out anywhere often lately. I think when we first started going out everything was new to us and we enjoyed ourselves but we have been growing tired of it. I feel we might need to see everything with fresh eyes. About speaking with people in English unfortunatly I haven't done yet. I've thought I was not able to speak in English if I didn't listen to and understand English. It's not so difficult for me to understand English that a non English native speaker speaks. But it's difficult to understand English that an English native speaker speaks. After all I think I haven't practiced hard enough to improve my listening skill.
