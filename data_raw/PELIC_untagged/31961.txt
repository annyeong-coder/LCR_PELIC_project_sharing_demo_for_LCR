Beach BBQ is good Sun burns my skin Coke let me feel cool Wave touch smooth I have been to beach few times when was in China they always give me some remarkable moment. Every time when I think back the beach the first thing come to a picture is the wave in the ocean. I don't know what you think about the wave feels like the first thought of my mind is soft and smooth like a hug from a beautiful young woman it open my mind like hand push open the window. The second attribute I can not every forget is the delicious food in the beach. BBQ is the one of my favorite food when I go to the beach. I like it not only by the taste of the BBQ but also the smoke. The smoke from the BBQ always makes people hungry and gives us a beautiful atmosphere. Take cup of coke after the BBQ drop me a pure and fresh fell almost ever time. The last thing reminds me a lot is the sunshine. I don't think any one who has ever gone to the real beach will forget it. It really can burn me up if I'm not stay in the water and I am the guy who doesn't like to put the sun screener on the body. So every time after I come back from the beach my skin turns to extremely red. That is my memory of the beach not all of them are good things but I still love the beach so much.
