Insomnia Insomnia is asleep disorder effects people of all ages all over the world. Many people have trouble falling asleep for enough amount of time. In this problem we have to looking for the causes of insomnia not for the insomnia directly. I have some suggestions to people who can't seem to get a good night's sleep such as natural cure exercises and control their self. The first solution use the natural cure for insomnia. They have to change their eating habits. For example they can drink milk with honey before going to bed. If they didn't have milk they can use warm water instead it. Also people have to make moderation diet and avoid as they can sugar and caffeine because they are activity article and we have to refrain them at night. They can also take warm bath before going to bed that can help them to relax. I think these are great natural cure for insomnia. Another solution to insomnia is to do exercises. For example all of people can try any exercise at their daily life biking and playing soccer or basket ball or any sport they like it. Those exercises make people expend energy during the day. Also people may have to register on Yoga classes because the yoga has special exercise to help people to relax. People can also do long walk to relieve their stresses. Always exercises can help people to live better with better health. The best solution then is to control their self. People have to avoid their self from thinking about their problems at night. Also they can read the holy book or listen to any kind of music they like it to help them to easy sleeping. People also have to keep them self away from any drugs because all sleep's drugs by the time have bad effects on our health.
