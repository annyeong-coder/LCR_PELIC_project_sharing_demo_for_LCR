There are a lot of ways to select a major. In my personal experience I can tell you the two ways that helped me to select a major. The students who are preparing to enter a school are worried about select a major. If you are not sure about that you'd better ask to your parents teachers and consult with aptitude specialist. It's going to be good to choose the major that you like and you are interested in. You should considered aptitude interest and outlook for the future when choosing a major. The first things you should consider are aptitude and interest. When you were in high school student an aptitude specialist will tell you and that can become your major. For example I had an aptitude test and the result was saying the major that I chose. I think my aptitude have good matching with my major because I like my major and I'm interested in it. In another reason I got a high score at the subject that is related in my major. You are going to want to choose the major that you like and interested in. You'd better to consider an aptitude and an interest when you choose your own major. The second thing to consider is outlook for the future. Nowadays it is a dull economic season. No matter how you have a lot of aptitude and interest about the major but if it doesn't have a future it's really not good for you. Of course the present is important but the future is more important. For now and also for the future you should select a major which guarantees your job and live. So what I mean is the important things for the selecting a major are aptitude interest and the outlook about the major for the future. To choose the major is not easy because it can make someone's future in his or her life.
