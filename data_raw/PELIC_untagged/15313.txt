People get divorce because of many reasons. For some the cause of divorce can be a personality or family financial problems. For others disloyal spouse is the main lead to a separate family. No matter what the reason is divorce can bring many effects to the couple's life especially bad effects to the whole family. Personal life and children's life can be largely related because of a divorce. A separate family can also largely affect the couple's personal life especially the one feel been dumped. Many divorced people have lower self confidence than people who have regular family life. For example they need to live alone which brings more loneness to them. They may upset their parents no matter what the divorce reason was. In some case they will lose some friends due to the sensitiveness of the personal. In other case divorced people often have financial problem if they don't have a higher paid job. It's always easier to support a family by two instead of one. Not only is personal life changing a consequence of divorce but also children's life can be greatly affected. As the Chinese saying goes children are the future. Even though some children study harder and become a strong person they would be better off in a whole and regular family. A broken family will not bring a warm and secure home to a child. A child who has a separate family often feels bad and that often lead to a future problem. For example my cousin had a classmate whose parents were divorced when he was little. The classmate became a trouble maker and finally dropped out from elementary school. In summary divorce is a big aspect of people's life. For themselves they have to deal with the all trouble and all 'side effect' of a separate family. For their children they have to tolerate the pain of living with only one of the parents. Due to the harm of a divorce case I believe many people need to learn to be more responsible and loyal in order to have a whole family.
