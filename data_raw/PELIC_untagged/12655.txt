I want to talk about my new apartment. Actually I moved the new apartment just a week ago. My apartment is slightly old but location is fascinating. My neighborhood is so nice. It is located nearby Seoul mart. The mart that sell to Korean food So it's convenience to me. I usually buy the Korean food from Seoul mart. My room has one bedroom a small kitchen a sunny bathroom. It is enough to live alone. My neighbor is very quiet but my neighbor rarely listen to music loudly. But it's okay because I love music. My apartment manager is really kindly. So I think I had fabulous choice even though it was difficuting choice to decide my new apartment.
