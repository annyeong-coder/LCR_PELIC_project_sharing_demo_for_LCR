If you spilled coffee on your carpet you have to remove coffee stains. According to ANON_URLSITE_first blot as much of the spill up as you can with paper towels. If you caught it while it was still moist. Next put a blob of white shaving foam exactly on the spot and work it into the carpet. For example colored towels may run on your carpet. Then rinse out the area with water either by pouring small amounts of water onto the stain and blotting it up with a clean dry white towel or by spraying it with the water bottle and blotting it up with a clean dry white towel. Finally Vacuum puts stain area once you've rinsed the shaving cream completely. In the caution never rub a stain. Rubbing will push the stain deeper and possibly into the base of the carpet or even the padding. This will cause the stain to resurface eventually. You can change the carpet back to clean.
