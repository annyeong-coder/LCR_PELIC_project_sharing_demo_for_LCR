The cities which are known as the Rust Belt have some problems with their economies as a result of that the number of the population of these cities declines. There is a significant question about these countries' renewal which is Are they going to have different approaches to revive their economics or are they going to wait untill they become small amount of number in their countries. For instance if Youngstown's situation is pondered when the jobs and the families left leaders of this area planned to make other people who are still in Youngstown relocate to other areas to bulldoze the areas which are abandoned. Detroit is the second sample of these Rust Belt Cities. In their automakers have trouble with financial issues. Due to this financial disaster the city population decreased. However some main universities of Pittsburgh caused Pittsburgh to have better economy. In addition Pittsburgh has a variety of reasons to have a good environment such as rivers and convention center. Inspite of having good environment not everything is going well in Pittsburgh. Whereas something is wrong with this city Pittsburgh is the city which is considered America's Most Livable City . Therefor also other Rust Belt cities need to follow Pittsburgh in the method of improving. On the other hand not only residents but also government has some responsibilities to improve their economy.
