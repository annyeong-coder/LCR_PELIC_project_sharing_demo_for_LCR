I used to scuba diving on vacations but I've not had enough chance to scuba diving since I got married because my husband doesn't have license of scuba diving. Since I came here in Pittsburgh I've been enjoying yoga with my friends. I've taken pawer yoga class in Shadyside and relax yoga class in Squirrelhill. I went to yoga class on this Wednesday morning because the Bible class in the morning had cancelled because Pittsburgh public school had 2 hour delay. There were few people there so the instructer came to me to teach the correct posture many times. I could learn many things. I was lucky. I'm interested in learning English so I have been studying Englsh since I moved to Pittsburgh from Japan. I think that learning other languages is kind of my hobby. I hope my English ability has been improving since I started to go to ESL in Pittsburgh.
