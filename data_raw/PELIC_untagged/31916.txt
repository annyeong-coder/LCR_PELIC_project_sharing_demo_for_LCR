A day at the beach It was a sunny day. We went to the long beach near Los Angeles. We took a lot of food and a beach volleyball. Our plan was flexible and we didn't have a complex schedule. Therefore we were available to do anything. We knew and expected something good will occur. There were a few people who were playing beach volleyball when were accepted to get in the beach. Many birds were sitting and walking on the beach very slowly and enjoyably. Some speed boards were running on the sea. A few kids were gaming joyfully. We were attracted immediately. We could even smell of sun. I felt I was in my dream and became younger. Nothing was important anymore and was required for me.
