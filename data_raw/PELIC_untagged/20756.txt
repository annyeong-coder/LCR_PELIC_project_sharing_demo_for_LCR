My homestay mom and dad are nice people when I come back everyday my homestay mom always try to straighten up the home and look after her child in the same time. My homestay dad work hard everyday he tried to teach me how to turn on or turn off the heater or TV and sometimes I watched steelers games with him. They have a son who is one and half years old and has a blonde hair he always light the room up because he is so cute. Because of them I can be happier in America.
