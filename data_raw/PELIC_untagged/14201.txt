I have many friends in my country where my family lives. Now I am in the USA for that it is a good opportunity to make new friends who come from different countries and cultures. My best friend who is a father of one girl and I graduated from the same university and the same year. We got our BSc from King ANON_NAME_0 University which is located in Riyadh. My close friend whose name is Aziz has some traits that make him close to my personality. I like a friend whose tongue reflects what coming from his heart. I prefer the person who does not speak too much and the one that is cooperative. My best friend is a person that has a sense of humor. One thing that I cannot tolerate is the person who is egotistical. All of these characteristics are obviously seen in my best friend Aziz.
