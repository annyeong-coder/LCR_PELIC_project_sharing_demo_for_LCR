After I came here I have been afraid of using phone. At the first ELI's holiday I went to Heinz Field to meet friends in order to watch a PITT game together. When I called one of my friends to ask his place I couldn't say anything and figure out what he said so I gave up to talk and hung up. And then he call back me however I turned down his call and sent text message. After the exchanging of a few text messages I could finally find out place where we met. Now I ended up the result that I prefer to use text message.
