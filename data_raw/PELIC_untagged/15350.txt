When I read this stroy I could find some categories that really fits to me. I would say I am an extrovert person. Extrovert person is a person who gets enegy from others. I love to have partys and meet with people. Even I like just meeting people in the hall way at school. I feel sick when I don't see much people at school. Also there was one more category which I fit in. But this time I recognized both oposite trait in one category applies to me. Judger and Perceiver is the category which both applies to me. Judgers prefer a predictable environment otherwise perceivers prefer to experience as much of the world as possible. When I am asking a date to hangout I want them to confirm the exact date but when it is asked to me I usually don't donfirm the exact date. I prefer to make a date depand on my situation and emotion.
