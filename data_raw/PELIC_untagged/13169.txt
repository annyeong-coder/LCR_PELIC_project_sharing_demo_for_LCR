It was November 1981 night off the South ANON_NAME_0 coast. Cathy Maready was tired and ready to go home. She decided to take a air plane. Suddenly the engine of the plane stopped. She tried to retrieve her scuba gear but the bag was stuck in the behind her seat. 30 Seconds later she was in the 15'C Atlantic ocean. She started swimming west. She was very tired so she wanted to stop but she wanted to live. She was a grueling 7 1 2 hours and she can live.
