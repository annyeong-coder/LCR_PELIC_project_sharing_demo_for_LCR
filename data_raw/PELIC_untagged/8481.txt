I live in a apartment in Pittsburgh. When I came to here I had never known anything about it. My teacher has just advised me to able to stay there. Because he lived in here for a mounth last summer. When I saw the apartment I have started to think about it. Because it didin't look comfortable and needed some basic changes. First of all I had to throw out the chairs curtain and buy new ones. They looked broken and uncomfortable. Also the bed's place wasn't good. I picked out an appropriate place and moved it around there. Moreover the rugs was very dirty. I covered the floor up with new and clean sheet. Then some windows didn't work well. Sometimes they were locked and it was really difficult to open or close them. So I wanted my houseowner to touch up them. Now they works well. In addiction another problem was in the livingroom. There was no place for the clothes such as jacket coats to hang them up. Also there was no place for the shoes to put them away when I take off. Other problems appeard after I had been living in there. However at now there is no problem except some small ones. At now I like living the this apartment.
