Everyone always would like to do and practice his or her activities and what he or she likes daily however he or she is busy in his or her work or do homework some days. Moreover there are a lot of stuff that I like doing every day such as walking watching movies and visiting friends. I can not do the same stuff daily because some of them need much of the time so I schedule these activities on Sundays. Although Sundays are usually days off Fridays are busy and work days. The same thing that I do amongst on Sunday and other days is walking. Not only Sunday but also Friday I walk for an hour because this activity walking helps me to be more active daily. However there are many of the differences between Sundays and Fridays. One of them is classes due to no classes on Sundays that means I have enough time to do what I can not do it on Fridays. Time of sleeping is other difference because I can stay up at night on Fridays yet I have to sleep early on Sunday nights because of school in the morning. Finally there are similarities and differences between Sundays and Fridays depend on our time. So some of the stuff which I have to spend of time is hard to do them on Fridays.
