One day when I had the first cell phone for me when I was 13 years old my father before he bought for me a new phone he was trying to TALK me INTO take his old phone but finally we END UP WITH buying a new one. After he bought it for me in one day I want trying to call my best friend and I wrote his number waiting his answer. . Some one answer me but I surprised because he was not my friend so I told him HOLD ON but he HANG UP . . And I didn't tell him I'm sorry ! After I FOUND OUT that's the wrong number I found a missed call from my friend so I CALLED him BCAK.
