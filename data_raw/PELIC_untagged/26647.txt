The authors believe that when children start going to school they are full of energy and they are eager to learn but by the time they reach third or fourth grade their sense of pleasure in learning vanishes because the traditional education system demoralizes their nature creativity of exploring the new things. In my believe the education system may play a crucial role in losing children desire of learning but this is not the only reason or in some cases the education system has no effect on learning aversion. For instance nature of children tend to love exploring new stuff. They seem engrossed in experience them and this is a sign says children like new stuff but the truth is not for example when they have new toys. They are in the favorite phase which is the exploration phase. In this phase their sense of pleasure in their own learning reaches the peak. Once this period finishes they lose that pleasure and start looking for a new one. In fact the same thing can happen in their education.
