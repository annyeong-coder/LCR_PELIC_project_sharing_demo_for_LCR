Hello I'm Ching ANON_NAME_0. Welcome to my website. I finished this website for 3 weeks. This is my second time to create a website. I have established a website before. I hoped this website can bring you interesting. Let me introduce myself first. I was graduated from a Taiwan university and now I have been studying in ELI class in Pitts. I already lived here for 6 months. I love this place. There are many good places. By the time I came here I had never know Pitts is a such a beautiful place. I've gone to the Zoo and museum in Pitts. They are awesome. After few days I will put some photos which I take in Pitts on the Website.
