By the time I was on a Medical TV Show in Shanghai I had been working in my hospital for two years. That's an incredible experience in my life. I had never been on a TV Show before. When the president told me they need a nurse who has outstanding nursing skills to attend the Medical TV Show I had already won the First Prize in the Nursing skill competition in Shanghai. When they started to make the TV show the atmosphere made me feel extremely jittery and my voice revealed my tension. As soon as I immersed myself in the TV show I started to enjoy the performance with professional nursing knowledge. By the time it ended I had gotten a lot of acclaim from the audiences. I had always had fear of showing myself in public but after that TV show I became more confident in my life.
