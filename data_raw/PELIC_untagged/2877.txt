In the text Can English be dethroned when Ronald J. L. Breton talks about the ties he is mentioning the connections or relations between the individual freedom and the power in the society and the relation between freedom and power in linguistic with social and economic aspects. That means that the most important think is the individual freedom because without it you cannot have power and for that reason if you don't have language freedom or power you cannot achieve freedom and power in your social or economic life. In addition according to the author understanding this connections make the use of English seem to be a problem because nowadays English is influencing many cultures and definitely there is no a total linguistic freedom. For instance if you don't speak English you cannot obtain a good job or you cannot study abroad your country or you cannot talk with people around the world or you cannot do international business. In conclusion even though English is the best way and a good tool to obtain certain things in life it limits our own freedom and power.
