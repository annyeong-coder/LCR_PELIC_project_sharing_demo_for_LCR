The most exciting thing that has happened to me in Pittsburgh is visit at Pittsburgh zoo because I had a lot of fun with my daughter. There were many animals and fish that I had never seen before. First of all a variety of fish in the PPG aquarium and a lion cub in the zoo were the most exciting things to see in the zoo. The aquarium also showed other interesting animals and fish such as penguins sharks a pacific giant octopus and jelly fish. Additionally it was the first time for me surrounded by crowded foreigners.
