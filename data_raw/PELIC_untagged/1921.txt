In my culture the mother and sisters of the man looked for the right woman. They met her family and her and talked with them about their son. The father of the woman started to ask about the man and his behaves. If he found that this person is the right one for their daughter. They used to call the other family ant told them about their approval. So in the past the man and the woman usually did not see each other before the marriage. Today is different than the past. First the women met with each other to see the girl. Then the boy met with the men. If they agreed about each other the boy can met with girl but the father of the girl should attend the meeting. Finally before the marriage both the man and the woman went to the hospital to see if they match or not. That is for not having sick babies.
