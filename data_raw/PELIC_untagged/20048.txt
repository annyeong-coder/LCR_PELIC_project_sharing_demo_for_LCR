Miss Hannah was living in the house that had a small garden well trimmed by her. Her house was far from other neighborhood. So she could not see another house from her doorstone. There were a lighthouse over northeast hill behind her house and a tongue of the St. Lawlence behind her house. Murmur of the great crescent of gulf was like her lullaby for her life. She loved the loneliness and considered a lighthouse star and the far away call of the gulf as her company. Even though she was very poor she has a kind mind to give someone a great wealth of friendliness and goodwill. Jacob Delancey and his young pretty niece visited Miss Hannah to ask her as if she could give them a few decorations for a party of the young folks. Miss Hannah had a full curiosity about his niece because she had heard the beauty about his niece. Ralph was Miss hannahs' brother who run away from house twenty years ago because of the trouble with his father. Before he left he gave her a message that he would make his fortune and would come back soon. Miss Hannah had believed that he would keep his word while Jacob had a doubt. When the grey November came Miss Hannah's garden was over and she felt very lonely. One afternoon when Ralph came back to her he was crippled and poor. He felt sorry for a poor wreck of a man who came home. But she never cared about that he didn't make his fortune. She just missed and worried about him. She was just happy for the fact that his brother came home. Even though he was not rich she thought that she was rich and satisfied with love and happiness.
