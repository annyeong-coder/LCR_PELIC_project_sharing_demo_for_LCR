I've already washed my clothes since two days ago. I've already vaccumed my room since five hours ago. I've planned to shop since last weekend but I've not done yet. I've not swum for long time. I'm goin to swim thes weekend. I've already bought cell phone from Amazon. I have not bought bikes yet. I have not ridden bikes for long time so it will be tough. I hav not called my family yet since three days ago. I have not washed dishs yet.
