There are several the personality categories which fit me. I can include either introversion or extroversion because I don't usually talk to people who I meet at the first time when I meet my friends who are very close to me I talk to them a lot and have fun. I can be also a sensor and a perceiver. In case that I'm a perceiver I don't decide. For example when I go to a restaurant with my friends I usually give them a chance of choice because I like everything in the menu. I think a sensor is the personality category that fits me the most closely. My father used to tell me that I'm a sensor because I notice many differences. For example people usually can't notice if someone who has short hair had his hair cut but I could always notice it. Sometimes when one of my friends wore a shirt which she just bought I could tell that it was a new shirt. Even she had a new bag or accessory I could notice it.
