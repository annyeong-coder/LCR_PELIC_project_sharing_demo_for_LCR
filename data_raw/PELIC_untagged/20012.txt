The effects of climate on my lifestyle I moved to Pittsburgh from my home town Nagoya in Japan 4 years ago. On the first year I was shocked by climate differences. Pittsburgh has short springs nice summers no falls and long icy winters. Nagoya has nice springs hot and humid summers warm falls and windy winters. I am getting use to climate here and adjusted my lifestyle to here. I think there are three main effects of climate on my lifestyle clothes house and garden. First I have kept my winter courts in my closet year around since the weather in Pittsburgh sometimes drastically change. For instance I had a very hot summer day and then the temperature dropped around 32 F next day. Second I live a fire place in my house and I usually use it during winters. The last I have a garden in my house . In conclusion
