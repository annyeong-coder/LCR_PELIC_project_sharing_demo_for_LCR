C El Balo N 101. 38530 Candelaria S C de Tenerife March 20 2007 Dear Irene How are you . I'm well but my computer broke because of that I'm going to buy a new computer and I need it for my job. Yesterday I went shopping to the Best Buy and I saw two good computers. They have the same name but Gateway computer A and Gateway computer B are different in many ways. First the Gateway computer A is cheaper than the Gateway computer B because the Gateway computer A costs 599 99 and Gateway computer B costs 699 99. Second the Gateway computer A is smaller than the Gateway computer B because the Gateway computer A has 14. 1 Screen and Gateway computer has 17 screen. However they are alike in several ways. Gateway computer A and Gateway computer B have the same special features options. For example memory hard drive reads and writes dual layer DVDs and CDs integrated 802. 11G wireless LAN. I would like to buy the Gateway computer B. I like it because the screen is bigger than Gateway computer A but it has a disadvantage because it is more expensive than the Gateway computer A. I don't know what I should do. What do you think about these computers Do you think the Gateway computer B is better than the Gateway computer A . I wait your answer. Sincerely
