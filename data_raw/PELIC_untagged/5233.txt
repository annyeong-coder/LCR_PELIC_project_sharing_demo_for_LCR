There are three steps involved in using a computerized index. The first step is typing in your topic and pressing the return key. The computer will search its database and give you a list of all the articles related to your topic. The second step is choosing which ones you want to look up. You can print out the list if you want. At this point you can just look up the most recent articles if you want to use only new articles. The third step is clicking on the box that says abstract. The computer gives you a brief summery of the main points of the articles. It is very easy to use a computerized index if you follow these three steps.
