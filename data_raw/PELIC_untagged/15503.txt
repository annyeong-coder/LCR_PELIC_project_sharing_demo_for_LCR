Guangzhou where is a big city in south of China is my grandma lives in. My grandma whose home I went every summer when I was a child. She lived in the third and fourth floor which was a fourth floor old building. During summer my three cousins two sisters and I were living in my grandma house. The fourth floor which we spent most of our time in there was no roof. A mini pool which made by plastic is in the right corner we were dabbling in it every day. When we were bored we shouted loudly and scared people who were waking in the street from the enclosure. Sometime we throw a little piece of firecracker when no one was walking on the street. When we couldn't find anything to do we leaped over to another building which was next to us. Every time when we landed to the building we must catch by a man whom he owns the building. When we got home from my aunt who took care of us during summer would punish us. By the way it was fun. I had a fantastic time in my childhood.
