When I decided to travel abroad Germany I did not know about this country except for the stereotype which all the people know. Thus I tried to find information relevant to this country. The easiest way to find it was to use the Internet. I typed the word Germany on the search tool such as Google website. As a result of this I got a lot of information so I had to examine all the documents to understand this country. However there were a little different from my knowledge when I compared it with the found information. Thus I could save the time to review all the uncertain information. In addition now I can agree with Yueh ANON_NAME_0 ANON_NAME_1 who said we have to have stereotypes to deal with so much information in a world with which we are often uncertain and unfamiliar. If I had not known stereotype of Germany I could not have comprehended this country because there were a ton of very different information.
