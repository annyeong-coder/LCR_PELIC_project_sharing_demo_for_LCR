I have been to the U. S several times but this is my first time in Pittsburgh. However I've been lived in Taiwan for 24 years and it is also my first time to live in foreign country. I always try my best to do it so I do not get many problems. In addition I've been lived in Pittsburgh since May. Unfortunately I haven't visit many landscape yet but I plan to do it in August. Although I do not have many experience in Pittsburgh but I've already visit Philadelphia and Boston. . I wish I can have an incredible memory while I traveling in August.
