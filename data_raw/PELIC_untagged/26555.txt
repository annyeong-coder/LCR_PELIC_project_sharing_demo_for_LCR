This story is about my achievement. I have a friend who was an international student who studied hard to acquire her Master Degree. I couldn't tell you her real name for some reasons but I can give you her initial name so we will call her C. D. She gave me some advices how to learn English quickly. She said To practice listening and speaking everyday are relevant to improve your English . Since then I tried to study every day as she said. My English is obviously better than before. I have a target date for studying my vocabularies and practicing grammar and now I'm studying abroad so I practice listening and speaking automatically.
