Hi and welcome to my online Profile. My name is Patric Last Name I'm a 20 years old guy from Sweden. I've 2 siblings one brother and one sister. We grew up togeter with our parents in a smal town 5 mils north of Stockholm. I love them very much. My biggest intressest is soccer and wakeboarding I use to have soccer practises every day before I went to the US and that was right after I graded out from highschool last summer. I graded out school as an air brush artist which is a big hobbie. But now am I studying in Pittsburgh English as a second language since a couple of weeks back. And live with an American family and taking care of their children. My plan after this is to go to Austaralia with one of my friends from Sweden to study. And hopefully take my bachelor degree there.
