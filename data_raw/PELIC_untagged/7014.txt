Sports have valuable to society because they provide entertainment and fun. Now a day each family have to watch the sport news because they feel entertainment to follow their lovely teams specially soccer team which is called football team. Sports are the easy way to pass boring time. For example in the bus station when we are waiting for the bus we can start talking with people around us to pass the time till the bus come however we do not now those people but because the subject is sport we love to talk together about it whose is the wiener and whose the loser. In my country some family encourages their children to enter the sport club since it is good to build the children's muscular so to speak but the facts are because sports starts earn ridiculously large salaries these families are looking for many . Imagine that your son or daughter earn 50000 per month or more. This issue makes some family do not focusing to force their children to enter the school and seek the knowledge which is useful to them. Teenager in my country however are plying football al the time in front their home. It is considered dangerous but in the other hand teenager believed that they have to be famous and talent like player's football team's X rather than player's football team Y and show this ability to the club they want to go thro. All in all the sports provide opportunities to people who have few other opportunities as job to present their country internationally
