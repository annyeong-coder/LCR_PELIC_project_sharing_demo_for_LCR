I asked Fah What is going on Thailand . She said that her contry's king was in hospital. I asked if he was getting better. She told me that he was getting better and she added that he was still doing physical therapy. I asked how the citizens' feeling was. She remarked that they were happy to have such a long living king because he was getting better.
