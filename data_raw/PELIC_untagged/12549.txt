Then he should advertise because many people don't know that his restaurant was opened. He should have more event everyday. For examples '50th customer will be pay for free' 'customer who meet birthday will be 50 D. C. ' Finally Higgins must hire professional chef. Obviously people want to eat unique delicious foods.
