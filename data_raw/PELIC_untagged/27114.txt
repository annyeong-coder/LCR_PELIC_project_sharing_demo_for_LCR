I got a certificate of baker. It is so hard to get one. But I had never given up and tried several times. Finally I got it. I was interested in baking a bread and cake. And I just liked to challenge something. So I had made up my mind and prepared to get a certificate. First of all I had been practicing several times. I always had been baking bread and sometimes failed. But these experiences make me be challenger. I had kept to bake and finally made a beautiful cake. Second of all I had visited a place where I took a test for baker. At that place I had practiced to make bread and cake. Finally I had making completely delicious bread and cake at the test day. It was amazing ewperience ever I had.
