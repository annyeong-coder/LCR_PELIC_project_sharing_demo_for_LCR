The Relation Between My Bedroom and My personality There is a relation between how my bedroom looks like and my personality. For example if my bedroom is clean and neat that means I love to be clean and neat at every thing. Also if my room is neat that encourage me to study at my room and that urge me to stay at my room as soon as I can. In fact I made my room to be sutable for me. In the left I but my bed on the right there is my closets and next to the window there is my desk I try to but my desk near to the window to make me feel good if I set on it and I can look throw the window with beautful view. Beside my disk I but my computer with all assistant equbments. This type of orgnaisation helps me to be comfortable. Finally from time to time I try to change stuff's places because that makes me feel my room is new.
