My friend June is from South Korea. I met him at the ELI class. Since we are from different counties which have different cultures and customs we had not copped with each other well. But I am trying to understand his country and I can be friend with him. I realize the important of understanding different country when I want to have friends from different countries. So I would like to introduce several differences between Saudi Arabia and South Korea such as environment varies foods and religions. First of all Saudi Arabia has many deserts dry climate and only 2 seasons. On the other hand South Korea has many mountains river and 4 seasons. Second there are differences and similarities between Saudi Arabia and South Korea food. Both countries have same staple food which is rice. However each country has unique test. Third while majority of Saudi is Muslim Korean believes many religions. To recap South Korea and Saudi Arabia have differences in many ways. There are different natures and weathers test of food and beliefs.
