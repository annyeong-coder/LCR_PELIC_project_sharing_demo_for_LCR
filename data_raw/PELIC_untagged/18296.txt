If I was in desert on a reality show I would bring necessary things including the water grain seeds that can be alive in the desert and camels. I think the water is the most important because If there were no water in the desert people can not survive in the desert. So I must bring the water. Also I have to bring grain seeds that can be alive in the desert. Taking the grain seeds is better than taking some food. Someday The food that I brought will be gone. Therefore I will cultivate some crops by seeding down. And I can use camels as means of transportation. They could increase themselves by bringing forth young. However I really want to live in the desert.
