In the past I use to collect Stickers and watch cartoons every day in the afternoon I was liked to eat ice cream and play skating on the beach . I use to liked my barbies and my little pony . It was a good memory of my childhood. Now things are change. I am busy in my work or study . I have a lot of things to do. Some time I don't have a time to meet my friends or hanging out life become more difficult when we grown up.
