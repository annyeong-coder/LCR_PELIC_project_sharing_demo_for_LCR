Some theorists might base their says on religious resource beside their current analyses in Egyptology. Von Daniken who is the author of chariots of the gods thinks that the earth might have been visited by aliens in the past and built the biggest pyramid. His claim based on that cutting moving and raising more than million stones to put them in the right position it couldn't happen within just 20 years. The biggest pyramid hasn't any heliography characters bless the builder or the engineer comparing to the other pyramids. One Muslim Abu Alwafw indicated that if there ware an Egyptian builder we would have known him. Therefore he speculated that building the biggest pyramid could have happened before the flood at the days of the prophet Noah peace be upon him . However it's still the question how Egyptian pharaohs without advanced technology must not build the pyramids. New study shows that building the pyramids has to have been from inside the pyramids. Some assume that the great stones maybe infused like concrete steel. So they speculated that old Egyptian must have had a chemical mixture to make those an real artificial stones. ANON URLPAGE
