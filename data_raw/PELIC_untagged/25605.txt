My home is my king dome I picked out the best couch in IKEA for the living room. I love everything in the house to be clean and clear if I read any books when I'm done I put them back right away. I like to touch up the wall with blue or orange or black it depends on the mood. If I'm going on a trip for more than a week I cover up the couch TV and the table. Some time I move the couch around to have a good view. Every day I throw away the trash because if I keep it for long time the house will smill bad. I love to hang up the postars on the wall. I to turn the light off when I'm going to sleep. Some time I sleep over the couch coz it's comfortable. Every day I look up for new thing to put it in the house.
