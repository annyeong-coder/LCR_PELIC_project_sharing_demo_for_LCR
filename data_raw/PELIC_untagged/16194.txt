I have many friends in ELI and some of them have something in common. Especially ANON_NAME_0 and ANON_NAME_1 have three things in common like a girl friend soccer and alcohol. First ANON_NAME_0 and ANON_NAME_1 don't have a girl friend now. ANON_NAME_0 likes a girl so He has tried to make a girl friend since coming to the U. S. ANON_NAME_1 likes a girl and he wants a girl friend too. Second ANON_NAME_0 plays soccer well and ANON_NAME_1 also a good soccer player. The soccer is the most popular sport in Thailand and Guinea. Therefore both of them are interested in the soccer and they have planned to play soccer someday. Last they never drink any alcohol even beer. ANON_NAME_1 doesn't drink for his religion because his religion bans to drink alcohol. In case of ANON_NAME_0 he doesn't drink for his health. He believes that alcohol is bad for health. ANON_NAME_0 and ANON_NAME_1 have three things such as a girl friend soccer and alcohol in common.
