My classmates and I will go to Desert Island. We've a box that we must choose three items. First we should discuss about important things that we need there. Then I must take a toothbrush because toothbrush can keep my teeth clean and healthy. Also I may take with me a pen and paper that I can write report about Desert Island. Finally I have to take matches which will help me there to cook and get warming from fire.
