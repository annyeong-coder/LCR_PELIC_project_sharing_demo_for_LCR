We have several festivals in Saudi Arabia one of the them is national day festival. In this day everyone who wants to celebrate wears green shirt or they can wear the traditional dress which is Thoob and shomag that we call them in Arabic . We have some folk dances that are people gather and dance with the green flag which is Saudi Arabia flag. Some people in the middle regions of Saudi Arabia where I grew up make a big meal and invite their relatives.
