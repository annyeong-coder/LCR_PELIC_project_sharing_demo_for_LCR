I like to listening music. There are many types of music. For example there is rock pop classical this is my favorite blues reggae hip hop rap jazz folk and country types. In fact each one of them are dependent on a group of music instruments. For instance some of famous instruments are guitar accordion banjo flute drum harmonica piano saxophone and violin. Audiences use different way through different electronic devices to listen to music such as MP3 MP4 CD player IPOD internet radio and TV. Finally I can say the music is one main habit of a lot of audiences via different ways and different types of it.
