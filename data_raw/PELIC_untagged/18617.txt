I have done so many things wrong in my life. But only one thing bothers me all the time is my mother's death. My mother who was a beautiful intelligent lady passed away at her age of 48. At that time she was diagnosed with cancer however nobody knew that she would be leaving us as fast as she did especially my mother. Doctors operated on her right away but came out without good news. We decided not to tell her about this which I feel it was the stupidest decision we have ever done. Can you believe that my poor mother still did not know that she was dieing. After all these years I always think what she would have said to us if we told her about what was happening to her. Especially me as the oldest daughter of hers I could have taken a responsibility and could have stood against everyone who came out with this goofy idea of not telling her of her problem. I could have done that. Why didn't I If she knew about her future even if it was a painful thing to know had she known I am certain she would have guided me and the family on what to do with our life in the future and I would not have this guilty feeling I have today.
