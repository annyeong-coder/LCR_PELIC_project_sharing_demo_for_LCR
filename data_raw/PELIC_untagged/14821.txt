When I was going to my friend's home yesterday I witnessed an accident by chance. Someone was walking down the street and a car was passing by the pedestrian. At that time a small piece of stone was thrown to him by the car's tire. Concurrently his paper bag was dropt and his glasses was taken off. He collapsed on the spot. Then the car was stopped and the door was opened. The driver got off his car and ran to the injured person. He had been cared by the driver until an embulance came to them. After a while he was cured by a first aider and he was moved to emergency hospital.
