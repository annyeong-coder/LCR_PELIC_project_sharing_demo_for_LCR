Dear Mr. ANON_NAME_0 I am a student at the EFL Computer Training Institute. My classes are very good but there are some things should be changed. First I think you should increase the number of the employee work there. Second your employees always should empty the trash. And you ought to let them respect the work time and the reviewers. Finally I think you had better give your employees tea break to refresh may be that will give them more motivation to run the work quickly. All students should be satisfied after you read my letter. With best regard ANON_NAME_1
