Eating a vegetarian diet. I'm not a vegetarian but when I came to U. S. A I saw many vegetarians. I know that meat causes some problems for people for example mad cow disease. Therefore I'm interested in vegetarian diet. In my opinion eating a vegetarian diet is better than the meat diet and good for our body and environment. First of all nutrition from vegetableS is good for our body. When you eat many vegetables you get many nutrients. Many dieticians recommend vegetables and fruit for a healthy body. Moreover a vegetarian have diet many other virtues. It can remove wastes in our body lower cholesterol and help us handle our stress. Thus vegetarian make diet our body more and more healthy. Secondly the environment is destroyed due to excessive growing of animals for meat. Many types of pollution are caused by livestock waste. If we eat vegetables mainly we can reduce many types pollution. I think that we can get benefits two from a vegetarian diet. These are health and protection of the earth. These are important things in our lives. I want to try to eat a vegetarian diet. Even though it is a very difficult challenge for me.
