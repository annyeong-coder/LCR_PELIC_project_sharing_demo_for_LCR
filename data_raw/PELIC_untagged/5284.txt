In the ELI there are five courses of English which are listening speaking writing reading and grammar. This is a good system for students because you can choose courses for each skill that you want to improve. If you are weak in listening you can take a listening class and concentrate on the study to improve your listening ability. I have attended some other English schools where they usually give us general English classes or English conversation classes. They were all right and enjoyable but I had to spend some time studying something I did not need or want to study any more. Dividing classes based on each skill is a good system so that you can study English effectively.
