P2 As I rushed down the stairs to eat a quick breakfast I trapped over my cat and got scratches on my face by her. With grabbing bloody my face I opened my refrigerator. However it was empty except a little rotten cheese and withered vegetables. After abandoning my breakfast I hurried into my clothes and rushed out of my house. P3 On the way to work I decided to take a shortcut through an old part of town. Because there was no traffic jam on the half of the way I relieved myself from the worry to be late. However in the middle of the way I found the tailgating trucks and a big board standing beside the road Under construction . That's why other cars were avoiding the way. After all I had to toward the way back and face to the long long way to work inevitably. P4 As I stepped inside I noticed a scowl on her face. There were bunch of papers in her desk which was a statement of accounts on last term. After a deep sigh she started pressing me hard. Though I had expected the harsh day was coming because of reduced profit I could not understand why the day was the right day after receiving the chain letter. During working in my office I was occupied the thought of the chain letter and my bad luck. Fortunately after that I didn't have bad luck any more in my office and it's time to go home.
