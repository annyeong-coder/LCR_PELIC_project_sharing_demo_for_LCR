People should work because people are social animal. For example when I was young my parents often had tripped except me. After my parents went to somewhere I felt a freedom. At that time I didn't like study so I could take a rest and playing soccer. During my parents didn't be my house it was my one of the best time. However after I spent many time to play soccer or watching TV whole day except activity work I always regret my own. It was stupid because I forgot a purpose to live. Confusions Idea says If you do not work you can not eat. We have to work because we need to find our own and a reason to live. We are animal but we are different alike generally animals like cat dog and tiger etc. We can not only eat and sleepy. I believe that exist god. Definitely god has a purpose to make me. I have to find the purpose and I want to contribute for my society.
