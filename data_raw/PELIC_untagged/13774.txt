Dear ANON_NAME_0 How have you been these days This is the first time that I write a letter to you. I am going to tell you about my typical day. First of all I get up about 5 50 a. M. After showering and having breakfast I prepare to go to the school. I go out home at 8 20 a. M. Get together with Hwasoon an ELI student about 8 30 a. M. And come along with her to the school. We talk about our homework or our life in Pittsburgh while we come to the school. Even immediately before I come in the classroom I chat with her. Then I take 5 ELI classes from 10 00 a. M. To 3 50 p. M. During the classes I hand in my homework to my teacher almost everyday. After class I come back home about 5 00 pm. After having dinner and washing dishes I light up my desk. While I do my homework I enjoy chatting with my friends in Korea by MSN or NateOn messenger. Around 11 00 p. M. I turn off the light and go to bed. I want to know your typical day. Please send it to me by the reply to this letter. Good night and see you tomorrow!!
