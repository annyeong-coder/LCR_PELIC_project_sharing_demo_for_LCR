I called my friend who is English native speaker yesterday but I couldn't figure out what he said because he spoke very fast. I told him to speak slowly then I told him I run out information about Pittsburgh and I asked him to find out about it. Also I asked him to try out my Gps and he met me and did that. Also He told me methods that cheer me up. Then we talked over about where we go.
