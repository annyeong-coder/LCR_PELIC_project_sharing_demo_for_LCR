The best eating experience I have ever had happened in six years ago. The first time I traveled in Suzanne Switzerland for 10 days and visited one of my good friends who was studying there. During my trip she was not only talking me to scenic spots but also showing me a lot of traditional and delicious Europe food there. The most fantastic dish I have ever had eaten before is called Foundu . It is a Hot pot in Switzerland and consists of cheeses and wine. So when the cheese and wine was blended together we could smell cheese. And then we used fork to stick some bread some meat beef and pork or vegetables and dipped with the Foundu. It was delicious taste. After eating the Foundu I started like to eat cheeses until now. So it was a good expereince for me to eat the cheeses.
