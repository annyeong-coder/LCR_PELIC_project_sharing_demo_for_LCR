However the life is different in small town and big city but I think there is a steady similar between living in small town and big city. Both of them have essential items such as groceries and gasoline stations or markets. Small town just like big city has roads and highway for driving. Small town is similar to big city that has emergency hospitals fire stations and police stations for people. There is different in living big living in big city is not like living in small town there are different between them. The traffic jam is more in big city then small town. People in small town know everyone in their area but in big city you might not know your neighbor cause there are a lot of people roam around the city. The life in small town is safer then big city because of the number of people are not as big as in big city. I would prefer to live in small town to avoid troubles and sacrifice in the features that are found in the big city
