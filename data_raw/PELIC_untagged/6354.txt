I think my house mother Mary Jo is most charming person I know in Pittsburgh because she is very patient to listen what I want to say. She also pays attention to my nutrition because I have allage for some food. Even though I moved out from her house she still supports me her help any time. Therefore I think she is the most charming person to me in Pittsburh US.
