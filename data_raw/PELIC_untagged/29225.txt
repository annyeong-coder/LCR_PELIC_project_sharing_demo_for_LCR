My goal has changed compare to the time when I arrived here in April. At that time it was to obtain enough English skill in order to get a job which relates to overseas countries such as a trading company after I go back to Japan. Upon quitting my job I also decided to finish studying for one year and find a job in Japan. However I decided to stay longer here. Having stayed in the U. S. And having communicated a lot of students who come from different countries I changed my plan. Now I'm thinking that I would like to get a job here so I attended Becky's job interview seminar last week. Before taking this seminar I felt really nervous and that feeling was similar to the experiences when I looked for my previous job in Japan. Although my practice interview was not good then I could sustain my calm feeling during the interview and I noticed the reason that I like English is this. When speaking English I feel more confident than speaking Japanese I don't know why though. I know the economy gets worse in the U. S and also getting a working visa is really difficult here. Even if it seems so tough to get a job here will I try my best this year.
