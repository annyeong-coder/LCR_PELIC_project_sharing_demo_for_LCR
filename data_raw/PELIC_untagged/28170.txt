My favorite types of art. What kind of artwork do you want to hang in your place There are many types of artwork paintings sculptures and photographs by artists from around the world. These art have different forms even though it pursues same ideas that create beauty commune with us a spiritual value and richness. Nevertheless there are my most favorite genre among them. The most favorite genre I like to hang in my room is painting. The reason is such as following. These three genres share most of the same points that express beauty delivery sort of message about something and create new idea. For all that my favorite type of art is painting. I think painting is relatively colorful liberal and poetic as compared with the other two genres. My second favorite genre is sculpture. I really like sculptures and these are no less beautiful than paintings. It's possible that sculptures are more beautiful than paintings in their perfect shape and cubic effect. Nonetheless compare to paintings which can use various colors and free form sculpture can be limited on those points. My third favorite genre is photograph from color photo to black and white pictures. Photograph has struggled to gain acceptance as a true art medium in its relatively short history. Photograph is now accepted as pure art without doubt. Still some people say that photographs are not pure art because of using scientific technology. I agree with this compared to painting and sculpture it is not easy for photographs express artistic sense like others. In summary my most favorite artwork is painting in spite of loving sculpture and photograph also. Compare to sculpture and photograph painting express much more a colorful and poetic form. In this connection I think painting can present best the aim of art that is to represent not the outward appearance of things but their inward significance.
