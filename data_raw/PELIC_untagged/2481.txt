Two effects that a lack of a positive role model could have on a young adult's development. Young adults' values and behavior might not correct. If they are lack a positive role model. Most people admire someone for example a movie star an athlete or a businessman. People always copy the behavior of people that they like or respect. Children always copy their parents' words. For example my friend has a daughter named Fiona. When my friend asks Fiona to eat her food or to take a bath the young girl always says no to her mother. Her mother tells her Don't say no to me and then she makes her daughter do something that she doesn't like to do. Once Fiona asked me to give her some chips before dinner. My answer was no. Then she said Don't say no to me. That learned from her mother. It is easy to see how was a child copy her parent's words. Teenagers and children don't have completely unique thinking and behavior. They learn everything from their family friends or people who they knew in the past. Therefore if the role is not a good model. Teenagers will copy some bad or wrong behavior. For example teenagers saw stars drug form news paper. The teenagers may think that drug isn't a bad thing because stars were drug. And young adults may think that I can do anything that I like to do. So they may always fight. From these examples it is easy to see how children or young adults develop their attitudes and behavior. In conclusion young adults really need a positive role model to lead them toward positive values and behavior.
