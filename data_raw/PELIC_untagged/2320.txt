The Difference of Success for Each Person The definition of success differs for each person. Each person has his own opinion or condition from special experiences or problems. For example some of my friends think that the most important aspect of success is the money. One of these friends has had a bad financial condition so he have encountered many problems related with the lack of money. So he always emphasizes the importance of money. For my parents health and a peaceful family is the most important thing because some of their brothers and sister didn't have good health conditions or had big problems with their family. So what I want to say is that the definition of success is different for each person because of their own reasons. For me my own definition of success is to enjoy my job. Enjoying something is an essential factor of one's life. When I was young I enjoyed paling video games baseball and soccer. I was happy because there was something I could do that I wanted to do. NOw I'm studing for my future and I have to get a job. I chose my major that I can enjoy. If I can enjoy and feel happy with my job the money a peaceful family fame and health will come together I believe.
