Toyota has told dealers that it will provide replacement accelerator pedals to owners who are unsatisfied with their repairs. In a memo obtained Tuesday by the Associated Press the Japanese automaker said that dealers can provide a replacement pedal at no charge. The memo addressed Toyota vehicles that were listed in the January recall and replacement pedal should only be offered to a customer after reinforcement bar has been installed. An AP analysis of government data found that more than 100 owners have complained to the government about problems after fixing their vehocles. A reporter remarked that Toyota has recalled more than 8 million vehicles globally over sticky pedals and accelerators that could become entrapped in floor mats. Another reporter observed that Toyota has been loosing the company's safety reputation and leading to government investigations and congressional hearings. A group of consumer advocates and engineers who were against Toyota's regardless of potential electronic problems said that they planned to hold a news conference on the massive recalls Tuesday. However Toyota has claimed that it has found no evidence that electrical issues are behind the recalls. An electronics general manager of Toyota's technical center in Michigan noted that the automaker has eight labs in Japan and it uses to bombard vehicles with electronic interference. Then she added that Toyota ensures that every system in the vehicles operated properly under those conditions.
