If I was going to be shipwrecked near a desert tropical island there is some good advice about to survive. I should bring a lot of things but I have to bring only 5 things. I would bring a lot of matches because with them I can ligh up for cooking warming myself and protecte me from the wild animals. I should bring some fire works because I could ask for help. I need fishing equipment because I would go fishing to feed me. I need to take a lot of fresh water this is important for staying hydrate. I would bring a cooking pot because I need cooking.
