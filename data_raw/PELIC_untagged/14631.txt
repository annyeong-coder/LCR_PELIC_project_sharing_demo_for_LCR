When I was a manager of change office one of my workers was stolen by someone. She was so unhappy because the amount of stolen money was not less. I said her you should have been careful and you couldn't have given money before you checked your money. I known that she was not a guilty and after this evidence I thought I ought to have put a camera in the change office because if I should have put a camera in the office the thief might not have stolen her money. On the other hand I was not sure who picked stolen money because there was no evidence about the thief. For this reason I should have warned her and I ought to not have said her you are not guilty. She might have been a guilty . Then I put a camera in the office.
