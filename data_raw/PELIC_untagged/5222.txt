My country is Taiwan there are many famous places we can visit. First of all Shi Lin nightmarket is a food heaven we can eat a lot of delicious foods there and we can also buy cheaper clothes there. Second the highest building in Taiwan is Taipei 101 it is also the highest building in the world. We can look down at the scenery of Taipei in top of the building. In addition we can do water activities in Kentin. For example we can play snorkeling there and see the view under the sea. There are many landscapes in Taiwan so there are many travelers go to Taiwan every year.
