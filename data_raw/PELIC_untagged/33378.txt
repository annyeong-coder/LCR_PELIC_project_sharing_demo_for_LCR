I had an interesting experience when I had came to Pittsburgh it had never happened to me before I have came. When I had lived in a hotel I had been looking to an apartment to live as soon as I could . By the time I had been looking the hotel had called me and told me that my booking had finished ! It happened in a hard time because I hadn't done any other reservations . I had always an idea that the hotels are always kind and they have to call me the reservation end but the hadn't .
