I have been most influenced by Jungeun Jo who was a smart woman. When I started working for company she was my predecessor. I heard about her abilities from some colleagues and she was called a cold woman. Duty was handed over to me very quickly and she never explained repeatedly. I was taught by her to work accurately. Finding my mistakes she looked at me coldly and her attitude made me to be confused. I wanted to be acknowledged and became a good friend with her. I didn't know why I had a good feeling in spite of her attitude. I went to the company on Saturday or Sunday and all processes of my duty were memorized for showing my ability. Though she gave me a lot of stress I was helped by her teaching style. Until I quitted my company I was able to work very well.
