I lived in a big room in which I spent a great time in my life. My bed room which contains a lot of stuff is at the second floor. My bed which I am very comfortable with is located in the middle of the room. On the right of the bed there is my desk wich I use it during studing time. In the front of my bed there is a big window that is centered in the middle of the wall. On the ground there is a carpet which is made in Turky. On the left of the bed there is balcony where I sit to watch the sea. I remebered the beautiful days at my room when I was in.
