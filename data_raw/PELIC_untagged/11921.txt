5 Years ago I read a book about Oprah Winfrey. At that time I didn't admitted university. So I always sad and I didn't study anymore. However I saw this book. I want read . Because I already know her name. But I didn't know about her life. So I wonder she life story. She was born an illegitimate child. She lived together grandparents when she young. She hoped live with mom. Because her mom got a job so she didn't like poor life anymore. Later she lived with mom but she was not happy too. Because she experience sexual assault and ate drug more fatness and then childbirth and child die. Usually people didn't experience that thing. But she didn't give up. So she was successes the life. I think she has success reason come from true power. Because she was take care many poor people. And she always helped with true mind. So now she has the famous name and come into one's own.
