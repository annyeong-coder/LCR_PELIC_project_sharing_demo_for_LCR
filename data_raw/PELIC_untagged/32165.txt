An interested in numbers and business I was pleased to study accounting in King ANON_NAME_0 University. I believe I am an excellent member in your organization as you will discover viewing my resume. Accounting has always been a remarkable influential part of my life which motivate my ability in critical thinking problem solving and data analyzing. Getting older I was motivated person and influenced by my mother. Having a high GPA in my graduate program I pursued a position on the business field in a leader firm. I am highly confident driven extremely motivated and perhaps most of all a very hard worker. I am also distinguished by my high level of social skills that I have refined over the years. Then I look forward to going back to pursue this job which I hope will reward me a beneficial experience. Sincerly K. H.
