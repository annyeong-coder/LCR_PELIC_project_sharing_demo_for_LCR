How to use a computerized index to do research is really quite easy. First all you need to do is type in your topic here and press the return key. And then the computer will search its database of magazines and journals and will give you a list of all the articles related to your topic. After that you can choose which ones you want to look up and you can print out the list of citations. When the dates of the articles are given right here you can just look up the most recent ones. Finally another good feature of this program is that it gives you a brief summary of the main points of the article. Specifically you can look at that when you just click on the box that says abstract.
