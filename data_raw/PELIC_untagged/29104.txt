Synesthesia is a rare mental condition that happens when some senses are combined with each other to perform a sixth sense. Before 300 years specialists have discovered synesthesia which cannot only taste but it can see hear or feel. Synesthetes who might have one or more of them might feel isolated until they know they were normal. Today the scientists can describe the process of Synesthesia inside the Synesthetes brain. The causes of Synestheisa are still unknown.
