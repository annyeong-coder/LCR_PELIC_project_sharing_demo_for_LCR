The differences between the rural and urban life. When I imagined about the differences between the rural and the urban life I supposed I am able to give my opinion about these distinct places because I was born in a Brazilian rural town and I have been living later in the biggest city of South America for the last ten years. I guess the most interesting difference is about how much time people spend on traffic. When I was living with my parents in a neighboring rural town I remember I could wake up about thirty minutes before the time when the school started I had a good tasting breakfast cooked by my mom and then I walked to school and arrive on time with a big smile on my face. The morning situation in the biggest city of South America could be a nightmare and it represents just the opposite of my childhood experience. Only due to the required time that I usually had spent on the traffic. The traffics jams can occur there regardless of the day time. So I used to wake up two hours in advance I had a fast horrible tasting breakfast while I had already been driving the car and I usually had spent more than one hour to arrive at work. I sincerely confess that my mood was not so happy this time.
