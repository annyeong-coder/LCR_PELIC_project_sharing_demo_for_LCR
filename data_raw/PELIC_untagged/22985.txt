When I thought about the things that make me happy I recognized the differences between the past and now. From my perspective happiness is relevant to the situation and the time. So it's changeable. A lot of causes could make you happy when you were a child but now you might think it's silly or at least you would not care about it for example playing with toys and eating candies. In my situation the concept of happiness became different after I became a father for my daughter Maha but still a lot of causes remind unchanged. I'll talk about how I was before Maha how I am now and what the causes that remained the same Before I had Maha there were many things I couldn't stand my day without. First I used to play video games. I was spending a long time searching for new video games and when I had one I forgot anything else. Also I couldn't miss playing soccer every week. In addition I used to keep in touch with my friends by meeting or calling them. Now with Maha everything changed or I can say she changed my life . The day I heard her voice for the first time I became happy like never before. Obviously I become happy when someone calls me by the father of Maha by Arabic abo Maha . Furthermore I am entertained by everything she does now for example watching her playing with her toys or trying to ask for something. I think now everything makes her happy it makes me happy too. And if I had a lot of money I would buy anything that would make her happy. For me still many causes for happiness remained the same. First I like to make my mother satisfied. Because she is the reason for what I am now. Furthermore studying electrical and learning new things like a new language make me happy. Also I become happy when I win a race or a soccer competition. It s obvious from my experience with the causes of happiness that my life is changed. Happiness now is not as use to be just about me it's also about people who became part of my life.
