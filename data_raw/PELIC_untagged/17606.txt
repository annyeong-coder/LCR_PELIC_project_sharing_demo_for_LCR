The other factor difference in the background could be reason of disagreement about many points even if it is not important. Also couple who came from the different backgrounds sometimes they will not getting on well easily. Dissimilarity on background usually causes divorce. The couple who has different mentality most time they will not getting in well easily. Sometimes the man is out going but the woman is very stubborn or the opposite. While one of them is generous the other one is stingy. Whereas one is selfish the other is not the same. We can incorporate other cause.
