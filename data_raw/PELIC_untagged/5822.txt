University of Pittsburgh has a really good English language institute. One of the things makes it a great institute is the teachers. I think the institute's management is choosing the teachers very carefully. After studying in the ELI it seems obviously that all of the teachers are qualified. For example ANON_NAME_0 my writing teacher has a great ability to deliver the information to the students very fast. Moreover ANON_NAME_1 is my speaking teacher. She can make us talk all the time and enjoy at the same time. She knows how to make us feel relax while we are talking. These are two examples of many other good teachers.
