Eid Al Fitr Celebration The celebration of eid Al fitr is the most intersting celebration for me and muslims in the world. It comes after Ramadan the month of fasting . It is involved into three holiday days the first day of the Eid comes on the first day of 'shawal' which is the tenth month of the Islamic calender. To celebrate this Eid we must prepare for it to come. First of all most people start to go shopping in the last days of Ramadan to get a new special clothes and new furnitur. The children have to get new and different toys like the fanoos a toy with brighting light this toy is unique for Ramadan and the Eid. Mothers prepare and bake different types of cakes sweet to be presented on the first day of the eid. Muslims hope to end this fasting month with their prayers be answered by Allah. At the initial day in the early morning people perform some practice as bathing and wearing a new clothes before going to prayer which done in a wide open places as parks or big Islamic centers. The muslims prayer is for giving thanks and blessing Allah and hope that their prayers during Ramadan would be accepted. After that they start celebrate the eid together by cogratulations with shaking hands and saying 'eid mobark' to each other and start to visit families and relatives and encourged to enjoy sweet candy and some delicious food. The children run and enjoy candy toys ballons and gifts which are given to them by elderly people. Finally at the end of the day the families take pleasure in sharing special dinner talking and laughing. They subsist a wonderful day in which each one hope that the next year will be better and full of surprices. So we end this Eid by wiches to our family a good life. For that religious festival in our country for both Eid Al fitr and Eid Aladha are the most obvious and interesting holidays they are wonderful for muslims to celebrated every year.
