I do not think men and women should live in separate societies because if they lived in separate societies they would not get married. Men and women especially husband and wife usually compensate their drawbacks each other. It makes help for their life. If they lived in separate society men and women would be hard to live. Also I think that if they lived in separate societies a new gender will come up in the separate societies namely some men will play men and others will play women in the separate societies. Chinese friend told the story for me. He said that Chinese monks grow up in the separate societies and they are not allowed to get married. Adult monk said to a young monk that you must not contact women because they are tiger. But when the young monk grew up he said I like a tiger . This story tells us the natural instinct of human. Overall even if men and women lived in the separate societies they would seek each other. I think men and women should live in same societies.
