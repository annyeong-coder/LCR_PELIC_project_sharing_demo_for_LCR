Do friends have to be people who has known your for a long time I don't agree with this opinion. My best friend cindy is someone who I meet for 3 months. It's not necessary for a friend to be someone who has known your for a long time. Last summer I went to ELI to study english. ELI is a place which attracts a lot of foreign students. In our class there were three people who were come from Taiwan. Cindy and I have the some interests but we have different personality. Cindy is someone who has shy personality. We were totally different but we still a friend. Cindy is a person whose friends are important for me.
