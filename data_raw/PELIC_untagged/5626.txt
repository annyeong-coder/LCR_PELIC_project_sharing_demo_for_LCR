Befoer I came Pittsburgh I had never tried to cook a new food so when I was in my country I was used to cooking only what I had been knowing. By I had been living with American family I had never known about American culture. I had never taught Arabic when I was in Saudi Arabia bur I have taught some moth classes. .
