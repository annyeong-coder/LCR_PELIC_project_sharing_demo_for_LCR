My room makes me get to a calm sleep. Especially my bed is cozy. It cheers me up. The wall's color is bright blue. And I think it doesn't necessary to turn color into. However even if it is good place to fall asleep it isn't relevant place for studying because a light is dim. Then I want to light my room up more than now. Beside my chair is too old to sit for a long time. It makes a noise when I lean on a chair. So I will throw it up. Finally the stairway to my room which is third floor also is too old. Therefore I will call my owner in and talk into touching it up. If he put it off I will try to settle on another place.
