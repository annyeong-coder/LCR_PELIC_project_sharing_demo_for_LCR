1. About living in Gaviotas not just a trip I have to say no. I don't want to live in Gaviotas. I have already accustomed myself to modern and developed life style so far. In addition to tropical climate can be a problem because I am use to living in four distinct seasons. The policy of this country seems like socialism country so there might not be free for living and not to get married is going to be corrupt problems. Even though Gaviotas have a fine view to live there is not really rational for me. 2. I think Gaviotas can't be successful. They may have a merit coming from their living circumstance because people have been living in poor surroundings so if they want to be in better life they can grow up as much as they make an effort. The policy of this country is an obstacle to success. If everyone earns the same without differences according to achievement no one wants to waste their time for better result. It means after finishing their work under a given portion they won't work anymore. There is no overwork. They are just satisfied their life even it has been continuing same condition without development. I think resources and technology are just second tasks to be successful on a larger scale in Gaviotas.
