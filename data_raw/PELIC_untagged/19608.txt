This weekend I went to see the panther's game. I appreciated the weather was wonderful on Saturday and it aspired me to participate the football game. Originally I hesitated that I should go there or not because I didn't know the ticket was sold out or not. I went to the Heinz Filed and knew the student ticket only costs 10 dollars. That's a dilemma for me. Because I tried to call my friends and persuade them to join the game with me but their answer was very ambiguous. It made me a little depressed. However I determined to go to this game lonely I thought this experience was very fresh and I wanted to introduce it to my friends. Although Panther is not like the professional team but seeing the game in the Heinz Field was a great experience. I thought I will invite more friends to join the Panther's game in the foreseeable future.
