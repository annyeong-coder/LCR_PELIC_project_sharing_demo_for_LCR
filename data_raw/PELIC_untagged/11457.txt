1997 Is the year when I was a child. We had a special place with my friends whom we lived in the same neighborhood. The place had a big rock where we used to hid under with my friends. I had two sisters with whom I got along well. They always were coming with us at the rock place. One day which our families looked for us around the street. We got lost on our way back to home. My oldest sisiter whose cared the directions. We were scared to be stay at forest all night. Two hours later we heard someone voices that was coming from right of a lake. As soon as heard the voices we yelled them too. Finally they found us in a tree den. It was a horrible night which I will never forget. After this event our families gave us a little punishment. We were going to stay our grandmother whose house was far away our house.
