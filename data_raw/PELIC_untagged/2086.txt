I think one of the most memorable points is the moment when the author looked around the lodge from the skislope. I think he was impressed by the view of a minimalist world. Also another memorable point is the trees covered with snow. The view may have given him sacred feelings because he used some words or phrases like in supplication nuns in prayer and ghosts. In addition seeing the undisturbed snow itself might have given him peaceful and quiet feelings. These things I said above are also the most memorable points for me because they make me feel I am away from my daily life and somewhere different and unusual like a dreamworld. Also they make me feel sacred so that I feel like I can purify or refresh myself.
