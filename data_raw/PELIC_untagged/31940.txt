ANON URLSITE' is very useful for me because I liked a series that is the modern family . I have those in my lab top but I finished watching all of it and I don't have a TV in my home. I've wanted see that this season since the last semester. I learned a lot of sentence or expression is suitable in specific situation because although I knew how to say but I couldn't say when I was stuck in communication with American didn't get it what I was saying. So I think that grammar reading writing are also very significant for me n my English but I can study about it in my country too. But I cant get experience from native speaker if I'm in Korea. To sum up I can know how to say when I'm on specific situation such as when I order a coffee or something like that. In addition I can use English subtitle at that same time!
