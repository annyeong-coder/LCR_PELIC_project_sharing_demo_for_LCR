Turkish food culture is different from American's food culture. I don't have any american food experiences. I realized any special food in USA. I think pizza's orjin is from Italy. In the chapter three writer says Many adult In the USA today simply don't know cooking basics such as chopping baking and boiling. Actually not only in the USA but also other countrys a lot of young people don't know cooking basics. I think it is true that some American's cannot cook. Many adults of today who never learned even the simplest cooking techniques from their parents. Some people prefer only convenience food that already been prepared and just needs to be reheated and eaten. Some nutritionists say cooking is just a quaint fashioned skill but an important family tradition that encourages more healtful eating. My friend's wife who is American is a very good cook. She says I learned a lot of kitchen skill from my mother. I think The Culinary Institue is a very famous training school for cooks in NY.
