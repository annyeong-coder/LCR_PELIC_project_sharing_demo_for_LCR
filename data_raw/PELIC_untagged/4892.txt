As far as I'm concerned going into a private business is better than working for a company. For example when you work for a company all you life you wouldn't earn a lot of money like when go into a private business. Another example my father was working in company then he retired at an early age and started his own business. Starting a private business can be venture. Although it can turn out to be a successful business. I think starting a business at an early age involves taking risks whereas starting a business after a minimum of 5 years experience is safer.
