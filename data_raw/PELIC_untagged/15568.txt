My parents in law are visiting us. They stay for two weeks. Maybe we will visit Philadelphia and Washington DC. Also we are thinking that we might go to the outlet in Grove City. We are definitely going to go to the Cheesecake Factory at the South Side. Moreover we may visit the Andy Warhol museum and the zoo. Pittsburgh has a lot of cultural things to do so we have to decided carefully what we want to do in this short time.
