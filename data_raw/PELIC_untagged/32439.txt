Erica is a good student and she is my partner. She has many activities in her life. She hasn't ridden a horse. She has taken a long car trip when she went to Florida. She spent around seventeen hours by car. She hasn't climbed a mountain. She has eaten something unusual like crocodile. She always likes boats and she has been on a boat in Taiwan. She has never gone camping. She hasn't seen ancient roman ruins. She hasn't heard a mariachi band.
