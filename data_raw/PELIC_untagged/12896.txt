I have been in the U. S since January. I stayed in Buffalo for three months when I first came to the U. S. After three months I moved to Pittsburgh. I've lived in Pittsburgh since May. I've been studying English for 6 months. I've already been to Washington D. C and Newyork city and Niagara falls. But I haven't yet been L. A. So I am going to go L. A this summer.
