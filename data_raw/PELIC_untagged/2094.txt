While I was visiting in Australia I took various experiences. For example I did skydiving. It was fantastic experience!! While the plane was flying to the sky I jumped off the plane. And I saw beautiful spectacles while I was falling off. I can't forget that sceans!! The ocean was realy blue so I confused ocean with sky.
