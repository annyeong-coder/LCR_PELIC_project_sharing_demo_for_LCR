My name is Yan Last Name . Yan is my first name which means swallow in Chinese. Last Name is my family name. I am from Beijing China. I am taking English classes in ELI of University of Pittsburgh. In my spare time I like swimming jogging singing and cooking. I am an easygoing person who likes chatting with friends or shopping together. Now I start making new friends in Pittsburgh. Studying English in the ELI classes is one of my favorite experiences because I can improve my English by practicing English in class. By studying in ELI I believe I could learn English more than I study by myself . I am not good at cooking actually but I still prefer cooking here because I think I can control my weight by having Chinese food.
