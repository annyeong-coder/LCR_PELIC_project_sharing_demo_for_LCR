The dog is a helpful animal. When I was a child I had very lovely three dogs. These are all kinds of maltese. There are two reasons why I like a dog. First the dog is a smart animal. One day our family went to the grandfather house for summer vacation and we asked my neighbor to feed our dog. When we came back we were perceived that our dogs were missed. My neighbor said that scarcely had our dogs disappeared when we went vacation. But at that minute our dogs were appeared before my family. The fact is our dog was waiting our family in invisible place. Second the dog is a faithful animal. One day a thief broke into my house. At that minute our dogs was protected our family. In conclusion the dog is a friend of the people.
