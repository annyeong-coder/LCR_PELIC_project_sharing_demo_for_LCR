I have the best friend who lives in Po hang which is my hometown in Korea. It's been fifteen years since we were friend. We used to go to a place that people can play video games and PC games. We liked to play video games. He was good at playing the game that was made by BLIZZARD which is a famous company in video game. Now He is in Seoul that is Korea's capital city. He wants to be an author who writes novels. He is studying for that and I'm sure that he is going to be the author.
