One of environmental problems in my country is Phenomenon of heat island . This problem occurs in the urban area such as Tokyo especially in summer. There are a lot of buildings roads paved with concrete a lack of trees. When the solar heat shines strongly during summer those buildings and roads keep the heat until night. Usually in the nature they are cold down with evaporation by trees. There are some suggestions to reduce this phenomenon. First we should reduce a large concentrated population which has a lot of carbon dioxide. Second trees are planted in urban area as much as possible. Third people should reduce cars which produce much exhaust fumes.
