A place that I remember from my childhood is Katsuyama cho . It located at the north of Okayama from where I came. It is a hometown where my mother spent the days when she was a single. I have gone to there every summer vacation when I was at the age of elementary school. I always played with my cousins who are elder than me. In the middle of the town there is a river which is called Asahi River . Sometimes we played at the riverside which faces the backyard of their house. They have a dog whose name is Elsa. Elsa which is a kind of Jananese traditional dog was very cute. She seemed to be totally a menber of the families. I always took a walk togather. Of course she has died yet. But I remember her face which was smart. When I'll go back to Japan I'll go there in which I have a lot of memories.
