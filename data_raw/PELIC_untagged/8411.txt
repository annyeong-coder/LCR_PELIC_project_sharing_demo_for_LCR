My husband and I were talking about saving for our vacation. We realize that we could spend less both in restaurant meals and entertainment. Many restaurant have low cost meals so we decided buy this meals insted of the premium ones or kids meals. This could help us save a lot of money. For entertainment we decided to go less often to the movies. In addition we thought of buying fewer trats at the theater and just one soda for both of us.
