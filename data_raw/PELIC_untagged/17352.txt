October 27. I ve been on the Canary Islands for three days now. I ll start home when the weather is better. I was so surprised when I picked up my mail today. My family sent some birhday presents to me. My birthday is the 31st. October 29. I think the weather is getting worse. I heard thunder today but there wasn t much rain. Typhoon and I stayed in bed. I starded reading Breave New World. October 30. I left the Canary Islands today just like Columbus. There s a strong wind and plenty of sunshine now. I went 250 miles. October 31. I m 21 today. To celebrate I drank a little coffe for breakfast and I opened my present. I got some perfume and some pretty silverjewelry. November 1. The electricity is low. I d better save it until I get near land. I ll need the radio then. It rained today so I collected a little water for cooking.
