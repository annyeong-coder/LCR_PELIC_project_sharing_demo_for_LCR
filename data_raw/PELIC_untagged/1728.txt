Adjective Preposition phrase interesting thing interested in cooking enough time at home have a friend whos good at cooking in Germany My successful cooking experience One of the things that I have been successful at was cooking. First I always think cooking is an interesting thing. I am interested in cooking Chinese food. For example if I tasted something good I like to ask them how to make it so I collected many recipes but I had no time to try to cook because my work was very busy when I lived in China. The second thing was that I had lots of time when I lived in Germany last year. I didnt take any work and I stayed at home. I was enjoying this period time so I started to try to cook Chinese food using my collecting recipes but sometimes I succeed sometimes I failed and it didnt smell good. I wanted to improve my cooking. The final thing was that I met a friend whos good at cooking when I lived in Germany last year. I was so lucky! She taught me many useful skills and corrected some mistakes for me I thought these were very important things and helpful for me so I cooked Chinese food better than before.
