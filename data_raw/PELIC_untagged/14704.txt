My father helped me be a strong and independent minded person. He tried to make me learn sports. When I was 10 years old he had me learn a swim and taught me to ride a bicycle. Whenever he gave me some allowances he got me to clean his car. He thought it would raise an independent spirit. And sometimes he was warm enough to embrace me and say It's ok. It's not important when I got a bad score in a test.
