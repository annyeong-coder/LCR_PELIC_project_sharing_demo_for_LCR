Before I came to the U. S I had not yet started learning English. Therefore I had never spoken English on street due to lower English speaker. In addition I had never used bus before. Also I had never worn jenz before I came to the U. S. During my trip to the U. S I had never taken a long trip by plane. So there is a lot things that I had never done before I came to the U. S.
