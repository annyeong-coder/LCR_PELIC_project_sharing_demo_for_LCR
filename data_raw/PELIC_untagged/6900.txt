PETS I like pets because I think that are so cute. There are many kinds of pets that we can have for example dogs cats birds rabbits etc. There are pets for all kind of people. I think that the pets are good company for the people specialty when someone lives alone. Also pets sometimes can take care of us. Pets are funny we can do some kinds of activities whit them like run play competitions and more. Another thing I think is that pets can understand us when we talk with them. In addition some kinds of pets are used specially for to take care of children. Also pets are used in therapies for people that have some kinds of illness. For that I think that pets have a good effect on the people.
