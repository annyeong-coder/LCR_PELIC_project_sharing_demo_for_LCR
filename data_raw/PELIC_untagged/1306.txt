Nowadays the Earth worming is one of the hot issues. Sometimes it is called Global Warming . The scientists found that the temperatures of the Earth have increased in the last decades. They consider this warming will change the climate of all the countries in the future. The cause of this issue is in what is called Greenhouse Effect caused by the increase of Carbon Dioxide CO2 emissions in the air. Therefore the CO2 work as greenhouse that it allows the sun heat to pass toward earth and atmosphere. On the other side it eliminates the heat dissipation from the earth to the universe. The industrial countries governments tried to create laws that eliminate the CO2emissions. One of the most famous agreements on this issue is called Kyoto Protocol . This protocol has been signed by most of the big industrial countries to work toward decrease the amount of the emitted CO2. Unfortunately most of the big industrial countries still much behind the targeted improvement.
