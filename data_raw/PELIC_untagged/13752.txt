Hi ANON_NAME_0 I usually get up at 8 00. After having breakfast I get on the bus and go to my class. I'm taking five courses this semester. And every Tuesday I always go on the Talk Time when my lunch time. I'm going to keep on learning English. Even I will go back my country. I will never give up learning English.
