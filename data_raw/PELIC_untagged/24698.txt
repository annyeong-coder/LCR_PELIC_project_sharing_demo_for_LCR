Although it is thought that people have been getting more and more unemotional they always feel sorrow for a person who is stricken by misfortune. When somebody dies many people go to his place and stay with his family members in order to support them. They never leave them alone since everybody has experienced grief and everyone knows how hard it is. When somebody dies many people show compassion for his family members even if they are not their close friends.
