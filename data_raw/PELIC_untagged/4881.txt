When I was 7 years old I moved to another town. I couldn't adapt myself to new circumstances environment . I was playing alone when I met her for the first time. Se was older than me she was beautiful and attractive. I liked her. We studied at her home together often and we ate lunch everyday. I got many experiences and courage from her after she moved to another country I couldn't meet her anymore.
