My ideal neighbor is someone who can concern about everything politely. Generally a nice neighbor is considerate towards other people. Therefore the neighbor doesn't make noises loudly or disturbances seriously in late time. Also an ideal neighbor would be helpful so he is willing to help me when I have a serious problem. As a result I would be reliable him. I hope to meet such a great neighbor.
