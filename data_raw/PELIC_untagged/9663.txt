Actually I have no idol whom I really admire. I will talk about Qi ShiHuang an important person in chinese history. He is alleged to be the first emperor. It is said that he took a series of major reforms to unify China such as unify the currency and character. He also built the Great Wall which was regarded as a very efficient equipment to protect the borderland of country during that days. On the other hand Qi ShiHuang is considered to be a tyrant. It is said that he killed thousands of scholars who opposed him. And he buit a city sized mausoleum guarded by a life sized Terracotta Army at the expense of numerous human lives
