An event that there's a 6 year old boy trapped inside a balloon flying around in Colorado has emerged to be a hoax. Richard and Mayumi Heene who are the parents of young Falcon Heene are professional trained actors. They are expected to be charged from a serious crime and whether they have legal right to take care their children. The sheriff said they were twice featured on a reality show so they might want to launch their career in reality tv too. The underlying reasons were unable to be justified by the father. However the family are going to be taken a lie detector test and confessing. As currently there's an ever growing trend toward reality show. So this event is a good example to create a new process for investigating stories that want to be publicity.
