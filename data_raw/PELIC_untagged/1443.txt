I visited michagan last year with my friends. We saw a lot of good places. Then we went to park and we played and we looked around to see how is it beatiful. After that we took pictures of each other. Then we went to restaurant and we ate arabic food. After that I danced to arabic music too. I tried to stay long in there but I dont have money enough so we came back to pittsburgh after I traveled around the US
