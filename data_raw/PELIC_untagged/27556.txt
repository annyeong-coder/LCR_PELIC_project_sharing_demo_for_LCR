I am living in a snug little apartment. My apartment always cheers me up when I go back to my house after school. I often straighten my room up because I don't like that my room become dirty. These days I want to clean up hard because I take some class up. I am thinking over how can I clean up my room. Also I look up the furniture. I want to do up my room more neat and beautiful. I picked up the blue chair in the Ikea. It makes my room more polished. These days I like to fix up my home.
