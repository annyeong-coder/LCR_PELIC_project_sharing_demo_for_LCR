I was in SALALA a city in oman when I first went to the hotel I discoverd that I wasn't reserve a room by my name but I remember that I resrved one. So I said to my self their must have been a mistake by agency person. I could not forget to regester but I did not finde the regestration peaper in my boket I said to my self at that time it must be in the car it can't be in my flat bachk home I am sure. Then I asked the receptionist to search by my son name and hopefully he found my reservation I said to my self I might have given the reserver the wrong passport I sould now on chick again my document before I leave the reservor office aigency office . What could have happend if I did'n use my son name . I do have to chick the name every time I ask somebody to make me I reservation. And I should not forget the reservation tickt again. Because I can'n tolerat the same mistak towce. I should be focus next time. After that story I told my self I don't have to be warry next time becuse mistaks hapend.
