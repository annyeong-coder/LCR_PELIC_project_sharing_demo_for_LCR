I don't think that sports stars earn too much money because they aren't just athletes but stars. Especially sports are overemphasized in America. So many sports stars were made in America. People love sports even crazy for that. Even if one athlete gets good prizes he won't sure be a sports star. Being sports stars are not easy because they should play well and make entertainment for spectators. Before they became sports stars they had faced many contests. In every contest they should be the best ones. After they are sports stars they have to work harder than before. So I don't think that sports stars earn ridiculously large salaries because the roles aren't everyone can play it.
