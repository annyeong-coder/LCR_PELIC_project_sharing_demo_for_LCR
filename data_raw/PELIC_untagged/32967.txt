Yesterday I was setting with Roy and Andy. Earlier we were cleaning the house it was the big cleaning day. While I was cleaning my room I heard loud music. Roy turned the music on loudly. It was fun. When we felt hungry we ordered Chinese food. It was delicious. Then I was doing my homework while they were using the washer and the dryer. Then we sat and watched TV.
