Both Pittsburgh and Taipei are my favorite cities I lived in Pittsburgh about three months before I came to here I lived in Taipei. Now I like Pittsburgh the same as Taipei because they both have many merits. First Pittsburgh has convenient transportation and Taipei has too. Next Summer weather in pittsburgh is the same comfortable as Taipei. Finally both they have many delicious foods. Anyway I am very happy in Pittsburgh now that why Pittsburgh and Taipei both are my favorite cities. The night in Pittsburgh is different from the night in Taipei because they have different culture and tradition. First the night in Pittsburgh is shorter than taipei because sunset in Pittsburgh at abuot nine o'clock but in Taipei at about six o'clock. Second Taipei has many people walk on the street in th night but Pittsburgh anly has a few peoples because the stories closed in Taipei are later than the stories closed in Pittsburgh. Finally we can buy many night snacks in Taipei but we can't buy any night snacks in Pittsburgh because Taipei has many night markets and we can find any we want to eat foods. In my opinion American and Chinese have different culture so the night in pittsburgh is different from the night in Taipei.
