My best friend has influence me the most. I still can remember when I first met her I was depressing with the people who I think they're my friends. The one who used to be my best friend didn't trust me with what I said and she told the others not to talk to me. I was really disappointed with her. Than she came to our class she had some problems that I had too. After I understood her problems we solved them together and soon became best friends. She helped me to trust people again. She taught me how to tell the people who is good or bed. She gave me the courage to do what I want to do. She has always on my side. Now I'm here in America she's in Taiwan we still keep in touch by the computer. I'm glad that computer had come to the world.
