Learning obroad is playing a crucial role in particularly countries that have progress in learning and have lots of strategies that enable learners to learn professionally however United States is the best country that has progress in many fields such as medicine computer scinces etc. . . Personally I have my decision to choose US penssylvania state Pittsburgh and ELI according to many factors. One of the major reasons which leads me to select US as my favorite place to sdudy is the system of education in the United States. US has a unique way to teach learners especially thoes whose native language are not English. American teachers have sophisticated ways and are supporative and concioncious. Also one of the reason that guids me to choose US for studying is that American citizens are very friendly and respectful and they respect the foreign people. Next point I have chosen pennsylvania State since it is one of the suitable state that suits me because the living expens is affordable the location of it is ferfect to me inasmuch as it is 4 hours drive to the capital of US Washington DC . The third thing of my dicision is why I have chosen Pittsburgh City Pittsburgh is one of the beautiful city in Pennsylvania. It has three rivers lots of shopping centers parks entertainment places and the nature that it is featured. The last thing and I can say that is the main issue of my decision is choosing ELI my place to study in. ELI has a high rank among the institutions in the United States. Moreover it is considered as the top one in the state. Its policy is very perfect and fits all learners. Finally its teachers are professional.
