I live quietly in a flat with my family. We have two bedrooms and a living room. We have a garden and we have some beautiful flowers there. In weekdays I arrive home at five o'clock and I have delicious lunch. Then I do my homework and go to bed early. I had a computer but now it doesn't work. I have a brother and a sister and I think I am very lucky to live with them. Sometimes our relatives visit us permanently. Our flat becomes very crowded sometimes but I like it.
