My hometown is located in the middle of Taiwan that is the most popular city in Taiwan. First the weather is warmer than Pittsburgh. I never seen the snow in my hometown until I came to Pittsburgh. Next there are several bars in downtown you can enjoy a exciting nightlife. If you feel hungry at midnight you can find what you want to eat easily. Then the biggest park in Taiwan is located in my hometown. The name of the park is Taichung City Park. A lot of families go there and see the beautiful sundown. Finally my hometown has many shopping malls that very crowded in the weekend. I love my hometown more than other cities I like enjoying the life in my hometown.
