I have a big respect of my father. This is because my father has devoted to my family consisting of four members. After entering a public company he never stopped studying due to my family. Having higher education background He wanted to be a proud father and husband. Also raising two children he had to deal with both earning and study more. Finally when I was 7 years old my father was graduated from university placing top one. Moreover when I was in high school my father got a master degree in his field which is related to oil. Having done his best he has supported our family financially and mentally. For these reasons when asked about my father I said that he was the person who have influenced me most.
