Alejandra Last Name Pride and Prejudice For some people it is unpleasant to see their favorite book made into a movie. They claim that the director didn't understand the story that he didn't reveal some important details or that the main character didn't resemble the character describe in the book. For me all of these statements are usually truth and that is what makes movies so interesting. It gives you the opportunity to see two points of view of a story you own and someonelses. For example When I saw my favorite movie Pride and Prejudice at first I was upset because I thought they had not cast well the main actress. In the book the main character was Elizabeth an intelligent but no so pretty girl. In the movie they chose Keira Knightley to play her. Keira in contrast is a very pretty British actress. After seeing the movie I actually thought Keira did a good job because she has an sparkling personality like Elizabeth's. Another difference was the choosing of the male actors Simon Woods was playing Mr. Bingley a very plesant and attractive young man but in the movie he actually was a little goofy. I wouldn't have chance so much that character but it was funny sometimes and it made the audience laugh. The final difference that I remember was the ending that was enhanced by the director. He made the two main character Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy get married and he ended the movie with a very romantic final kiss.
