Several weeks ago I met a wonderful woman who is sales clerk of curry's shop. When I ordered out two curried rice I could not notice a poster cash only . It was crucial information for me. The woman started to cook the curry I ordered. At that time I noticed the poster and I did not have enough money for my order. Then I changed my order. In spite of that I could get two curry. She offered one free. I tendered my acknowledgment to her. Some days later I compensate her in cash.
