The first text is about the experience of scientists which discovered new tallest trees in the whole word. The author started to compare the different type of the tallest tress on the earth for example the coastal redwoods which can grow from a seed into a tree that is 50 feet tall are taller than Sequoias. The tallest living tree on record is a coastal redwood that is recorded at 379. 3 Feet and is still growing. Before the 1980s scientists were not able to discover the top of a redwood until they fell down but now mountain climbing techniques and tools make researchers able to study these trees and the animals that live on trees' limbs. Then the author concluded this text by some assumptions of scientists for how tall a redwood can actually grow and how long it can live. In the second text the author shows an adventure story about a fearless person with her. It is started when the author's family moved to Sweetwater because of her father's job and she spent so much time in the library at the first time because she feels lonely. Then she described the adventure story when they were riding horses in the forest and it was an important experience for her. After that they were climbing the white birch tree whose branches are too high up to reach. At the end of the story she revealed the fearless of her friend when she fell down. Then when she appeared she was laughing.
