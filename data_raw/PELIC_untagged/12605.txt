My room which has the largest surface area in our house is painted in baby blue. My bed that located in the corner is covered with wouderful sheeth. There are two windows through which the air is entering and refreshing the room. The window whose handle is strong I open it more frequently. My computer disk that located in the middle of my favorit room just opposite to the air conditioner has a lot of shelves in which I keep my CDs and some important papers. The walls are full of beautiful photos the one which I liked most is fixed above my computer disk. My sofa is placed in the center of the room where light is the maximum. I really like my private room in my countery in which I become more comfortable and relaxed.
