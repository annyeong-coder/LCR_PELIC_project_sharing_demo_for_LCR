As other many medical problemes obesity in children can be caused by inherited or aquired factors. Alsadi 2007 said inherited factors can contribute up to 30 of childhood obesity . Obesity can be transmitted genetically to children from their obese parents. This fact was proven in 1992 by reserches done on 2000 obese children in USA the results showed that in approximatly 90 of obsesed children there was family history of obesity. Many scitetests are traing to locate the gene responsible for the obsity in children in an attempt to modify it and eventually to reduce the precntage of obese children. Aguired causes of obesity in children are nearly two thirds of the total. The most important aquired caues of chilren obesity is eating of fast foods that contains alot of carbohydrate and fat. Many childrens in developed countries such as US. Prefer to have their foods in resturants Resturant food such as haburger have high suger and fat contant in the same time they do lack vegtables and fruits which are very nessesory to build up a helthy child. The second important aquired cause of obese child is sedentary life style and lack of reqular excercises. After the era of the modren technology children arround the world stared to spend alot of houres watching TV playing Vedio games and serving internet. In addition of being sticked in their houses most of children use the cars as a method of transportation even for near places where they supose to go to on feet. To put thing to gether obesity in children can be caused by by genetic as well as aquired factors. Most of aquired causes are modefible In my openion educating the children to do regular excersices and to avoid fast food will reduce the percentage of childhood obesity by 70 .
