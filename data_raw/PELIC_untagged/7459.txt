The ruins changed history when researchers proved that a complex urban center in the Americas thrived. But much remains to be discovered about Caral and the Caral supe valley culture that flourished there for more than thousand years. Ruth Shady Solis a Peruvian archaeologist from San Marcos University discovered Caral in 1994 and was stunned by its size and complexity. Shady and her team continue working at Caral but she also dedicates her time and often used her own money to promoting the project with Peru. Finally they discovered many things in Caral such as necklaces of snails the seeds of coca plant great quantities of cottonseeds fiber and textiles etc. It's very important because it's oldest civilization in America.
