Causes of Preference for Boys Nowadays women have the same rights as men. However in the past most families in Chinese culture preferred to have a boy rather than a girl. Even though in the 21st century some parents still have this thought especially in Asia. There are several reasons causing this situation. First of all the histories affect a lot. In the past the king of China always gave his power to his oldest son the prince. Moreover the oldest prince's mother would be a queen. Therefore every wife of the king wanted to have a boy in order to be the queen. Today the situation is the same in some families. When a woman has a male baby her mother and father in law would feel very happy. Furthermore they are proud of their daughter in law. Secondly in the past most people in the countryside should work in their farms. Besides most farmers were very poor in the past. They needed to have more workforces to do the farm jobs. Usually men can do more hard work. Therefore most parents wanted to have male children instead of female ones. Sons could help the family business and work longer. More daughters in one family meant more people share the food. Therefore in the traditional thought of China farmers thought that daughters are useless. A farmer would prefer to give his daughter to other families rather than raise her. Today this thought also affects some people. Thirdly sons share the same last name of their fathers. In order to maintain their last name some families like to have a boy rather than a girl. When a woman gets married she should change her last name. Moreover her son's name should go after his father. Without sons some families' last names may disappear.
