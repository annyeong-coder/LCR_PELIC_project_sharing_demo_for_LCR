When I was in army I was working in department of military supply so food matter was one of my jobs that I have to work with. One day when my last day in army wasn't far away I was arranging some boxes of food. Suddenly I thought even if I get some food secretly it won't be a serious problem. So I stored some biscuits beverages and instant noodles secretly and few days later I shared that food with some of my close colleagues. However when I called a close colleague who was still in army after I was discharged from the army I totally regretted my behavior. There was a serious inspection because of lack of some food. The reason of that situation was me!! I shouldn't have stored that much food. I was allured from that silly temptation of some snacks. If I could have been patient a little bit more my colleagues wouldn't have been punished. I felt so guilty for my stupid and greedy mind. They might have blamed for me but I had no excuses. That event was one of my most confused times that I have ever had.
