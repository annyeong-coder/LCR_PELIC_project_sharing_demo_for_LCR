When I was 12 years old I met my dog Mini. Mini was so young and I was too. When it came to my house I was reading a book. So when I found Mini in my house I was surprised because I didn't expect to see Mini. She was really cute. While we were living together Mini let me know many things like responsibilities and how to take care about dogs. And when I was sad Mini made me smile. We liked to go to mountains. So that's why Mini is my important relationship.
