Some counters have strategies to encourage students to work because they think it will help them in the future and it can develop country economic. Others don't agree with this idea because they think it will affect on their studying. Omran said let you son work when he is teenager you will get professional son when he will be in his 30s . Actually I agree with this idea because I think you will get two significant benefits you will get experience of job field and it will guide you to choose the correct major which you will study at university. The first benefit you will get beyond working while you are still student is getting experience of job field. That mean you will get good imagination about job field. For example when I was still student at primary school I was going with my father to help hem in his post office. At the beginning I just was cleaning the office after to years my father demonstrated how I could receive mails and send them. Also he taught me how I can deal with clients. Actually I got good experience from working with my father. The second benefit you could get from working when you are teenager that you can choose the correct field which you will study at university. While you are working you can see which things you like and which not. For example my fried who is a computer professional told me that he choose studding computer science after his working in the secondary school library. To sum up I can say that working at teenagers help you to get good experience and it help you to choose correct field at university
