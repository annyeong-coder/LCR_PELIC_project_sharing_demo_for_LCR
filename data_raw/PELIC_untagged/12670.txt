In the end of March this year was my first vacation in the U. S. I had never known that we would get 3 days off in that semester. If I had known that I would have visited Washington D. C. Instead of staying home. I should've awoken to the schedule of that month or I could've had a lot of fun in another city. I should've got different experience in the U. S.
