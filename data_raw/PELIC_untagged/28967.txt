Since my dad works in bank I decide work for bank in the future too. When I began to applying for university I chose mathematics as my major. Because math always works in all kinds of field. I want add economics as my second major after I'm in university. Because many students here work on double majors as well as my advisor encouraged me to try it. My recent goal is always applying for MBA programs but now I'm also considering continue to my math study after my undergraduate study. As my math professor said you'll in it once you love it. I love math more since I'm in college. Hence I think I need began to preparing for GRE study since it has so many hard words many of which even native speakers don't know. Hope I can do well in the future.
