Variety is the spice of life. The life is exciting when we try different types of experiences. I had had many experiences in my life. First of all about one year ago I was planning to go to college in Turkey but I decided to come to USA for my higher education. Then I have finally started college in Pittsburgh. Even though I am majoring in biochemistry I am taking ceramics classes which has made a differences in my life. I did not have an idea about arts before I took that class. However I now know many things about ceramics and the people who specialize in arts. I feel that taking ceramics course has broadened my horizons about life. You shouldn't be afraid to try out new stuff experiences in your lifeAll of these new stuff will controbute to your life experiences in this world.
