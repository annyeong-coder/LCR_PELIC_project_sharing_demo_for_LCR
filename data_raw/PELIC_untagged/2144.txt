I think the most memorable points of the landscape for the writer is 'when the lodge is well behind me with only the forest ahead I at last stop and look around. What kind of magic is this A minimalist world. '. He couldn't keep going because of beautiful vista. And then he also said it is just look like a magic. I think when the writer wrote these parts he tried to describe the view for us lively. I could feel that. Actually I really like magical things so while I was reading these parts I was excited because he wrote it's like magic and minimalist world.
