1. Do you think English has become culturally neutral for second language speaker Some people say that English is just a useful means to communicate with the others. As the world become global the need for the language to talk between people who speak other languages has raised. Now English plays the role as a main language in several international fields. However I don't think that English is a neutral means for second language speaker because a language has tacit and intangible traits. Therefore English is not only related with American culture but also can eliminate other languages. From my point of view to speak English in all international relations can cause cultural imperialism. A language is associated with her country's history and culture. It also affects thought system and people's spirit. For this reason a language is very important and people should try to keep and protect their language. In addition cultural imperialism is very subtle and intangible as shown in the article Can English be dethroned and then it is easy to dominate by English without knowing that. What is more other languages are affected by English and can be easily changeable. For example if children start to learn English at the early time they can be poor at their mother tongue. The possibility is too high that the children who can speak English fluently may transform and pollute their language according as English usages. If this trend continues they may lose their peculiar traits in the language and what is worse they may lose their language. In short I think that English is not a neutral means for second language speaker.
