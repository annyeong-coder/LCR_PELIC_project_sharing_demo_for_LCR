In order to obtain PHd degree in Artificial Intelligence I have to completely achieve the next eight things. I have already got Bachelor degree in computer science. I have already had a job for a year in the same major in Jazan University in Saudi Arabia as TA. I have traveled to the United State of America. I still haven't learned English very well. I haven't got a score at TOEFL ibt exam yet. I still haven't took the GRE course. I haven't got master acceptance in the University of Pittsburgh yet. I still haven't obtained master degree in Artificial Intelligence.
