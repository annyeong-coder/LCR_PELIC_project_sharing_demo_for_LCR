Although I never have any religious there is one belief if the God. This is that when the God made human to dominate in the world he also gave them the ability to feel pain in whole life. As a result all the people have many source of pressure in their life such as money health and relationship. Even students have source of pressure in their lives for example schoolwork money and worry about future. If you are a student you probably feel as if you are sitting on a thumbtack when you sit down to study Korean joke . Most students have to study for major but not all students can be first in their class. So besides exceptional students most students might have a lot of stress. One might wonder then why students would try to get high scores that is because they would like to get high salary for their whole life. Money is another source of pressure. If you are a student of university you might worry about your financial situation. You are already adult so you should earn the money yourself. So you should get the part time job or reduce the expense which has been spending the money. Finally you probably worry about the future and what you will do. In Korea especially everybody would like to be better than other people. Unfortunately unrest of future might connect death. For example someone who lacked of ability was killed himself because he thought that he wouldn't be success. If you look back on your life you always have many source of pressure. Even when you were in elementary school you felt stress. However I think stress is better than non stress because if you don't have any stress or everything is fine they will be lazy. On account of stress people try to overcome their own problems or find a satisfied life so do I.
