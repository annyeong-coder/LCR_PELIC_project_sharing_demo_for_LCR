My family has changed in the last few years. My family lived in Khamis Mushayt in the same house for 30 years ago . But in 2009 my parents moved to my village it is far from old city about 250 km and they have lived there since then . Also my brothers and sisters got married before 2008 and every one of them has lived in separated house since then. Also I got married in Augest 2009 and I lived in separated house with my wife but in Augest 2010 we moved to USA and we have lived in pittsburgh for two months. In the past I met them every week but now I cann t meet them So I contact them by phone every week.
