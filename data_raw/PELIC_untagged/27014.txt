When I was young I lived in Kwangju. Kwangju is a very quiet and livable city where I lived. When I was 5 years old I had a big female dog whose name is Heendung ee in Korean. Heendung ee was a best dog whom I loved. She had a beautiful white fur which I liked. She is my best friend with whom I was playing. It is beautiful memory of my life. But I cannot think of a time that I was shocked. She passed away during the cold winter night. At that time She was 13 years old. Her body was buried by my father wrapped with white fabric. Memories are faded out but some memories are never forgotten. It was said that day was the coldest day of that year. This cold weather made me very sad. Because I thought that she might be very cold under the ground. When winter come I always miss her.
