There are many advantages of teaching young children business skills and strategies. For example the children can learn advertising and marketing techniques during the process and they can learn business etiquette and style and so on. During this process most of the children have already big plans for their futures. But I think this is not necessary for all of the children. It's to early to induce them to think only in the business way. It may restrict their interest and their perspective of the world. So I think we should be careful to foster the business skills and strategies of the children who are already very interested in business.
