Scientist found that some animal are genius and people can use them to do a valuable work. In a research lab crow named Betty she was hungry and she could see a piece of meat in bottom of test tube she bent a wire and use it to reach the meat. That shown crow can use a tool and make them. Also in Tokyo suburb crows wait until light turn red and fly down to eat without fear from cars and the crows teach it to each other and some crows were smart enough to use a vending machine to get nuts. Researches showing crows can be trained and give them useful work in the future animals and human will cooperate if people allow them to survive
