My favorite vacation destinations sshing D. C. Has one of the most famous views and also has many historical landscapes such as Washington Monument. In addition many people are attracted by beautiful cheery blossom a lot at Washington Monument area in spring. On the other hand Orlando deserves its reputation as a happy land because of the famous Walter Disney World and the warm weather. S ther and our hotel were also perfect at this February. However I didn't have time to go to Universal Studios and Sea World. I would like to visit the theme parks and the other sites as well next time. Go back again.
