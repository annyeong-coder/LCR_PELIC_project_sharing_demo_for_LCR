In our life we hear almost everyday about happiness. It make me wonder what is happiness How are we know if we are happy or not Happiness is not a material that we can visualize with our eyes or hold with our hands. After much tough I came up with three signs of happiness people's appearance the way people interact with each other and their achievement. Because of my job I have to interact with many people. From my observation one of the signs of happiness is body images. Happy people smile. They have good posture bright eyes and animation in their eyes. Because of the happiness some people's eyes smile when they speak. As a consequence a good body image make people confidence in themselves. Another sing of happiness is the way people interact with each other. Happy people have good relationships with their friends family and co workers. They are easy going polite and supportive. Happy people make other people laugh. If people are happy they also have excellent social skill. As a result happy people can build strong friendships. The last sign of happiness is people's achievement. Happy people are satisfied with their lives. Happy people positive attitudes cause success at work home and community. As a result of good education and knowledge people may find their happiness. Some people love their jobs. They fulfill their spare time with work. Their job make them happy. Happiness is not a material but we can feel it. We can recognize happiness the way we look the way we communicate and our achievement.
