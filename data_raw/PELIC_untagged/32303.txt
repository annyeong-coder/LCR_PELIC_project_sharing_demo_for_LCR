In my opinion women are better parents than men. The first reason is because women have the natural instinct of taking care. Other reasons are that the society is changing is becoming more and more common families with just one parents. Women are much more independent today than in the past and also they became as firm as a man can be to educate their own children. However it is true that some men are much more sensible and sometimes better than some mothers. But they are exceptions.
