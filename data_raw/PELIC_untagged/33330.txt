In the whole of my life I had experienced that did not appear particularly significant but one. Though it was just a sentence told by my father when I was a senior high school student it affected me from then on. At that time I had never study physics before because I am not good at mathematics. I was an average student in my class. So I had been disappointing to myself for a period time. Once I got bad mark . I told father that my mark was even worse. That time I thought father would rebuke me. My father said Don't worry it still has enough time to work hard . Be believe in yourself you will have a good result in future. I was shocked by it a common sentence to comfort others. After this happened in the later test. I had recalled the sentence . So I had never forgotten this sentence since then. And it would affect me in a magical way forever.
