The flow is a special zone that a person sometime gets in and he feels all alone without any restriction what so ever. And the interesting thing when a person is in that zone is the complete lost of time whish means he is 100 focus on finishing the task on his hands. So complete focus without restriction will give the brain the ability to be creative.
