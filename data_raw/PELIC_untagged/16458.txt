I think meeting someone through internet dating is not a good idea. At first it can be dangerous situation to meet stranger. The worst case people may be involved in some trouble or crime by believing in untrue information. We need to act attentively. Second it is difficult to know a real personality through internet dating. I think a real personality is reflected in behavior in a community for example school work place and hobby group etc. Therefore meeting man to man through internet dating is not effective way to know each other deeply and develop a solid relationship. Third people tend to have higher expectation and image than reality in the case of virtual dating. That may cause that people disappoint or be disappointed easily when they meet actually. Then people may feel that the whole process is waste of time. It is so sad situation. In conclusion I don't agree with internet dating because it includes many negative aspects. I think it is natural and right to develop deep intimacy with someone who is in the real community not in a cyber world. However if my friend really wants to I recommend meeting in a group to avoid such risks I wrote.
