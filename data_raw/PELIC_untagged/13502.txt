I have several tips when I get stressed. First I shout loudly when nobody is with me. Second I concentrate something to do. Third I listen to the music or radio. Importantly I recommend just sleeping all day. As you sleep you don't have to thinking of the problem or bad things. These tips help you to reduce your stress.
