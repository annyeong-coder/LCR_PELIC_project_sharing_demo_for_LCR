Dear Concerned I am very sorry to hear that. I know it is a difficult situation but here is my advice. First you already had a serious conversation with Erec and tried to make him realize what is going on. Unfortunately people have their on decision. It is nothing else you can do for him in this moment. Probably he will realized how importance are your friendship and the meaning of studying. As you said he is moody messy an undependable. You should think about yourself in the beginning. Moving out would be a good solution to you because quality of life is important at the school time. In this way you can continue helping your friend by give him some advice. In addition you can have a comfortable place to live without stress. I look forward to hearing from you. Sincerely Advisor
