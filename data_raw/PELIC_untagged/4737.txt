There are a few things I want to put into a time capsule for people in the future to see. These things will extend my memories experiences and the world I know. The first thing I would like to put into the time capsule is my notes and dairies. They are about my whole life what I have learned and what I have done. The second thing is photographs. I would like to put the photographs that I have taken such as magnificent buildings beautiful clothing and gorgeous shoes unforgettable sceneries and delicious food. The last thing I would like to put into the time capsule is a video camera and a recording. In the recording I will talk about the stories of the photographs and my viewpoints of the present world I am living in.
