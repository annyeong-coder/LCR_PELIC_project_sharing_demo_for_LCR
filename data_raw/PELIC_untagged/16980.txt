Hello my name is ANON_NAME_0 and I have been living in USA since 2007. I came in U. S. A. Because my family lives here now and I really want to study my MBA. For this reason I've been studying in ELI for 5 months. After I started to study in ELI my English have been improving a lot. In addition I have been dating an American guy and He has been helping my English improving a lot. I am pretty happy about having the opportunity to studies in the ELI and dating my boyfriend. By the way Living in USA isn't just studying. I have been traveling for some city too. I went in Columbus OH Washington DC and others city. Going to Washington DC in August 2008 was my favorite trip. The reason is I met my boyfriend the first time there because of that I have been dating my boyfriend so far. Living in USA has been a wonderful experience in my life.
