2. I lived with my parents and my siblings who you've met. 3. I had two sisters whom I felt a close connection and an older brother. 4. My sisters and I share a room where we spent nights talking. 5. My brother who I hardly ever saw slept on the living room couch. 6. It was a large old couch which my father had made by himself. 7. My best friend who I loved her family lived across the hall. 8. We went to the same school where we both studied English. 9. Mr. Robinson was our English teacher whom everyone was a little afraid. 10. After school I worked in a bakery which my aunt and uncle owned. 11. They sold delicious bread and cake which people stood in line for hours to buy. 12. My brother and sisters who I miss live far away now. 13. When we get together we like to talk about the old days when we all lived at home.
