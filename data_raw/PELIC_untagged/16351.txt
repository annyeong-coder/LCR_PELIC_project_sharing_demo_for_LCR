In the weekend I usually find myself running after my kids. On Saturday morning I take them to the gym. After that we return home or visit a friend. We also play outside. On Sunday we travel a lot or go to a park like Moren Park or Shenly Park. Also we like to eat outside in restaurants like tgif and lulu noodles.
