There are two sides to every coin Everything in this world has two sides just like a coin. In other words there is a bad side and a good side of everything. I believe that this proverb can be applied for everything in the life from important things like believes and religions to less important things like soda. Everybody has his own perspective or reasons to like or hate things in life. However we should always look at the bright side. This rule can be applied for cultures and societies too. Things that are holy and important in some societies might be prevented to do and disrespected in others. These similarities or differences are mainly consequences of religions old Habits and values. Like the other cultures the Saudi and the American cultures have similarities and differences. The most obvious differences and similarities are the social life eating habits and interests. A comparison between the Saudi and the American cultures reveals some surprising similarities. Saudis are as friendly and helpful as Americans. For example both of them see that people with special needs should sit first in public transportations. People in both cultures shake hands when they meet with people. Contrasting Saudi and American cultures will reveal some surprising differences. In America straight men do not kiss each other on the cheek when they meet but in Saudi Arabia they do. While Saudi people sit on the floor at banquets Americans sit on chairs. Furthermore there are no friendships between males and females in Saudi Arabia but it is OK in the US. In conclusion even if we are different in the social life eating habits and interests we should never forget that there are similarities.
