Achuar's eco tourism will changes their traditions and environment. Whatever their purposes are tourism is the start of the industrialization. Many countries make much money through their special environment such as Thailand and Philippines. There are many greens on which people can play golf and lots of places that have been developed for tourism. People who live in Thailand and Philippines didn't develop their environment when they started tourism. As tourism became a big part of the nation's income they started to develop environment. Therefore the environment has been destroyed significantly in comparison with the initial situation. Achuar's environment will be transformed as tourism goes and the changes for tourism can potentially harm the environment as other countries.
