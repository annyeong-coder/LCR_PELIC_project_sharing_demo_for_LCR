If I were able to travel to any country I would go to Brazil. For me Brazil is one of the great countries of the world. If I travel there I would try the famous Brazilian coffee. Also I will enjoy the white sand beach and for sure I will participate in the carnival. The most important thing I would visit the home town of Garcia Marquez if been there.
