In recent years the increasing variety of service animals such as the guide horses which are better than guide dogs in several respects lead to a dispute about if no matter what kind of service animals can be allowed or not. For example the guide horses are mild mannered have good vision and live longer than dogs. Therefore guide horses can help disabled people better than the dogs. However they have some disadvantages in some specific situation because of their big size. For that reason the U. S. Government tried to make disabled people stop using the service animals. On the other hand the number of service animals had increased gradually and they was entitled from A. D. A. To go everywhere with their owners. In conclusion the common ground between the people who agree with service animals and people who don't has not been found yet and the conflict about how to balance the needs and rights of people is contended at law.
