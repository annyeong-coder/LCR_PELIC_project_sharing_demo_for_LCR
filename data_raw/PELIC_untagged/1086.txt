October 17 2006 Dear basma I thought a lot before I wrote this letter. You asked me to buy a computer and you did not decide which kind do you want a P. C or a laptop. In this letter I am going to compare between them. At first both a P. C a laptop are almost the same price. Second a laptop is easier for carrying than a P. C so you can take it with you when ever you want. On the other hand if you have P. C you can improve and add new hardware. In addition the P. C lives longer than the laptop. Finally if you buy a P. C you will have a P. C table rather than laptop. Think about that my love I hope to buy something that gives you more flexibility when you are moving. Love
