One of the funniest situations I have ever been involved in happened when I met a new Saudi student downtown Pittsburgh. The fact that it was her first day to go to school was unforgettable. She was living in a hotel near south side and luckily it had a shuttle. After finishing her first school day she did not know how to go back to the hotel. What I thought was funny was she called the hotel to tell her which bus she should take. The receptionist gave her the bus number. What made her laugh was there were many bus stops at that street. So she had to read each sign to find out what bus stop she wanted. What was funny was she thought she could catch the bus at any bus stop. After 30 minutes I called her to know whether she arrived or not.
