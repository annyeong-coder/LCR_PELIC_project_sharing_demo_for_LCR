During the high school we always shared together because we have to stay at the school whole days except time which we were sleeping at home. Also we have the same schedule. We could enjoy happy time while we were studying at the high school. However we entered different university. It made us hard to meet for each other. While we were studying at university we could meet one time for a month. Fortunately during the break we tried to meet and could see each other. While I was training at the base camp or am studying in Pittsburgh I could contact with them by cell phone. So now we are still in touch with each other.
