I think the idea in this article is reasonable. One of the most important factors to choose our partners is their personality. However we sometimes cannot accept someone involuntarily even before we don't know about the person very well. I think this is because we cannot feel comfortable psycologically with this person . After reading this article I think the reason we tend to choose our partners for the first impression is the smell they have. When people get married with someone most of them don't choose the person who has a similar genetic make up such as relatives. If everyone has their own smell we may unconsciously choose an appropriate partner based on their smell.
