People travel for several reasons. Some travel to make business others like me travel to complete their study. Studying abroad is my chance to get better education and experience. Some say travel includes seven benefits. Among these benefits meeting people and recognize their culture. But first I have to decide which the most suitable place for me to achieve this goal. The USA was my ultimate choice but the big distance and financial difficulties prevented me from choosing the USA. In the last three years my government offered scholarships for students to study abroad. Eventually I presented my documents to apply for this big chance and after several months I got the scholarship. I felt that I was lucky because finally I will accomplish my target. The serious procedure has begun where can I find the appropriate college in the USA I started searching the Internet trying to find the suitable program. In the same time I asked one of my friends who lives in the USA for an advice.
