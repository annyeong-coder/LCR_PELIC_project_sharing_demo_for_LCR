I am a student of ELI where in U. S. I am 30 years old and I'm from South Korea. Now I am living in centre ave Pittsburgh PA US but I am looking for a new home. Because my roommate makes a noise. And it is disturbing my study. I like quite and comfortable place. By the way my personality is activity and social so I like to meet many friends and go party or club. Sometimes I feel alone because I am not living with my family and cannot meet high school friends who I meet everyday to play a game and drink beer. On Sunday I go church and meet all kind of people who have a different job personality etc. I can learn social skills and share many things. My favorite activity in church is volunteer. I can help poor people and make them be happy. So it is satisfing myself.
