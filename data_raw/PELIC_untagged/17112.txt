Nah is my best friend in the U. S. He was also an ELI student now he is living in Georgia. I met him while I was living in Virginia. He liked to drink wine but I didn't drink any alcohol at that time. One day he invited me to his house and gave me a glass of wine. That was the first time to drink wine in my life. After that we went to a dancing club together. Actually we didn't like to dance but we could talk to native speakers in the dancing club. When we go to somewhere usually I drove a car. While I was driving he was sleeping. He liked to sleep. After lunch he had a nap. While he was sleeping I did homework.
