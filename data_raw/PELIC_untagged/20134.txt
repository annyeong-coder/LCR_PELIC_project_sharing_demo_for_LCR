I love my apartment because it is simple. I have been living in this small apartment since March. Everyday after I get though hard work I sit down the sofa and have a cup of tea so I feel relaxed and comfy. There are several things to figure out in my apartment. I wrote down the TO DO list . First of all it needs to turn old carpet into new carpet. There is a big hole on a mosquito net so I should throw away it not to let in the mosquito. In addition I'm putting together a variety of the frame. I will make up on side of the wall with the frames. Finally instead of the broken ceiling light I want to hang up the chandelier on the ceiling.
