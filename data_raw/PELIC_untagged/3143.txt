Saudi Unemployed In Saudi Arabia an aggravating unemployment situation is dangerous to the society. The unemployed people are a large burden on the national economy and they act like bombs ready to explode. The number of young men searching for jobs has increased in recent years. For instance the unemployed people are around 10 percent of the total Saudi population. Most of these unemployed are intelligent but they couldn't find an opportunity in education or training for jobs. I know one of these people. He graduated from high school and his GBA was low he applied for university and jobs but he have never got any admission since 2000. However he is very sad and upset. In my opinion there are many reasons for unemployment. One of these is that the government doesn't make a good plan and strategy to create new job opportunities. The second reason is private sectors. They don't work with the government to create new jobs. On the other hand the unemployed people have a responsibility to work hard and try to find an opportunity. Finally I hope that everyone in my country get his chance and they get what thy want.
