Was the first day of my primary school. I was 7 years old. I and my mother was walking around the garden of the school like all students and parents. Then my mother saw one of her friend who was holding her doughter's hand and started to talk. The girl and me was just looking our faces. My mother turned to me and introduced me to the girl and said that was Begum and Begum's mother. And they both said that they were friends and from now on we would be friends. We talked shortly than hold our hands. Until this time we didn't unclasp our's grasps. We were all the same classroom until university. We really got along with her still we do. We were together in our good and bad times. She is my best friend. Will last forever.
