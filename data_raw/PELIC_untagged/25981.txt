Yes. I think that a sand castle is a work of art. The definition of artwork is very complex because every people may have different ideas. In my opinion sand castle is a kind of art because it is a kind of sculpture that made of sand. The Wikipedia said that art is the process or product of deliberately arranging elements in a way to affect the senses or emotions. Sand caster can make influence to effect other people so sand castle is a kind of art. Sand castle is just like sculpture but it is made of different material sand.
