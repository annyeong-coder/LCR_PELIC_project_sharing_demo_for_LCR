There are two men sitting to a table playing a game. On one side of the table sits the president of the United States president Bush playing checkers. On the other side sits a man in an Arabian clothing playing chess. They both seem really serious and thinking deeply. President Bush has the next move but he is thinking about it. They both obviously are playing a different game against each other. Therefore they don't understand each other. They are speaking different languages in terms of plans negotiations and future goals.
