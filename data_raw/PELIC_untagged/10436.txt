I can buy a flight ticket by my credit card in order to get a free tour insurance service. Besides I also can decrease desires of watching a couple of movies buying some clothes and having a little entertainment. Meanwhile I can use many coupons to spend less when I buy a lot of things in the internet. Finally few colleagues can carpool to work or take lots of public transportation to drop the fuel cost.
