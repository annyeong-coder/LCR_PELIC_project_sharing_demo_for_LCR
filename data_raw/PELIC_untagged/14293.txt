Kimchi which is the most famous Korean food is my favorite food. It is a kind of side dish served with rice and Korean people enjoy eating kimchi almost every meal. It is made of cut into 4 sections or 2 sections and salted Chinese cabbage red pepper powder minced ginger minced garlic and aekjeot which is the fermented fish sauce. In addition we can add chopped onion trimmed green onion julienned radish julienned carrot julienned or minced pear or apple fermented shrimps and so on to kimchi. Kimchi is red because it is covered with red pepper powder. The texture of kimchi is a little rough and hard at first but change to smooth due to osmosis as time goes by. Kimchi has almost similar length and shape to them of the Chinese cabbage as an ingredient. Before eating kimchi we usually tear it into pieces or cut it to rectangular or square shape. If you want to enjoy kimchi well tearing is better than cutting. Kimchi is a kind of fermented food. Therefore we can enjoy various smell and taste of kimchi according to the fermented time. In other words smell and taste of kimchi change as it ferments. At first kimchi has fresh strong and spicy smell and taste. A week later it has less spicy smell and taste. When kimchi is fermented further it has sour taste and smell. I eat kimchi every day and can't live even a day without kimchi.
