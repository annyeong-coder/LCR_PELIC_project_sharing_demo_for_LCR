Jasim AlNahas 20 may 2012 Grammer 4 My Apartment I live on a small nice apartment. It is an awesome one but it needs a few modifications. First I like to cover up a new carpet. Also one wall needs to touch up. The curtains are hard to put back. So I plane to throw it away. I like to give sweet smells out. Sometimes I like to move the bed around. Actually I love to fix my room up to be more beautiful than before. So I will rent furniture every six moths rather than buy a new one.
