I think the thesis of Prof. Jacob was pretty cleaver but I am far from agreeing with his thesis. His thesis is the kind of hypothesis which may not seem quite right to adapt to common people. Smelling out can lure heterosexual but it all depends on our natural smelling to fine the perfect soul mate it does not seem reliable to me. First of all I agree with that smell might play a part in how people choose their mates to make people stick together. When it goes saying like will to like which can prove how people choose their friends and their mates. For example we will see people have the same interests or habits that they are instantly bonded with one another such as smokers with smokers golfers with golfers or Asians with Asians. Secondly if smell triggers back our memories in a bad way what you should do Will you ditch the guy who you are seeing by smelling the same cologne of your ex If that situation happens I bet that your brain will just tell you to keep an eye on that guy instead of ditching him. Your brain system may just immediately recall the unpleasant memories back to you and tell you to stay away from him at first time but in a long run you will realize that you are meeting with different people with different situations. Finally I do not think that people choose their mates by smelling or it depends on smelling to influence our first impression of potential partners. Newsday there are a lot of people smoke and most of people who smoke do not have good scene of smell. How come those people can smell others' odor types instead of cigarettes I do believe that pleasant smell can relax stress and let you feel so good but it does not seem reasonable to help you seek a partner by smelling.
