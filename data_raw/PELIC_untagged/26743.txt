I am a Libyan normal guy I was born in 1975. I loved the environment where I lived. I lived in Tripoli Libya. The life was good in a different way. I used to wake up at 5 AM and I used to study before sunrise while listening to the radio but now I get to bed late at night and wake up late in the morning. I used to have daily work after getting back from school such cleaning the area around the house feeding our sheep and go to the supermarket. After high school I majored in mechanical engineering and graduated in 1999. After one year applying to different companies and looking for a job I a signed as a demonstrator in mechanical engineering department AL fateh University. I worked there helping in preparing and giving tutors. In these times I enrolled in graduate program and in 2007 I got a M. Sc. In mechanical engineering power section. The study was in Arabic language but we write in English. Until now I am single because I missed 2 opportunities to get married although I have a separate house to live in. Once it requires some decoration I was not very enthusiastic about the marriage. I used to be very sociable and to love visiting friends and relatives but after enrolling in M. Sc. Program I did not find a time for that. I realized that I have to improve my English especially speaking and listening thus I planned to study abroad. At first I target Canada but I failed to get a visa and after I got a scholar from Libyan government I made up my mind and chose USA for studying English and doing a Ph. D. Since I arrived to USA I made a lot of mistakes due culture differences. But I really find American people a beautiful and kind not I was thinking. Now I am ELI student and I am doing a little bad in listening and speaking classes but I am trying hard to improve grammar mistakes in speaking. I wish I could speak English fluently.
