My family is a big family. We have 7 people in our family. My father mother three older sisters and one younger brother. My family lives together in my country. I had a wonderful time when we do everything together. My father is the great leader in our family. My father is an old man now He has white short hair. He did not taller than me. He has powerful dark eyes and a wrinkled face. He has brown skin because the sun has burned his skin. Sometime he looks serious but actually he is a very kind and fun person. My father is a hero for me. When I was young until now he is worked hard every day to get money for our family. He never complains about his work and he taught me a lot of things. He taught me I should work hard and be patient. My father never smokes and drinks liquor. He is saving money for our family. I love my father very much and I want to take care of him and everybody in my family. I think my father is a significant person in my life. I will do everything to make him happy.
