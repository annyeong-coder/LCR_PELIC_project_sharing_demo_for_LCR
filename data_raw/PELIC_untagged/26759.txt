I'll talk about a dear friend in my life. I met her in ELS while I was studying English. It was a new session in ELS center so we would have new friends. She used to sit in front of my chair. Then I talked with her and I asked her where is she from. In one day I asked her for a launch after the school and she agreed. We went to a pizza restaurant and we had college special pizza and it was nice. We were talking over the launch about a lot of thing. She told me about her family and about her dog. Fortunately she is an accountant like me. She invited me to her apartment and we had a Brazilian cuisine. Because of her I know a lot about Brazil and so is she about Saudi Arabia. Do you know her Maira .
