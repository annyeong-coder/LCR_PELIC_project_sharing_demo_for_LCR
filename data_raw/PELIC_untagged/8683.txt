When I was 16 I had a best friend I have ever had. We always stayed together whenever we did anything. Then something had happened. She never trusted me from then on so our relationship went to an end. We never talked had no connection just like we didn't know each other as the other one was a stranger or invisible. I wish that thing had never happened between us. If it hadn't existed I wouldn't be here right now! I probably still stay in Taiwan and study a university with her. I only wish I had forced her to listen to me when I knew she won't talk to me anymore. Although now we knew it wasn't true and talked about it a little bit but the close connection used to be between us could never come back again.
