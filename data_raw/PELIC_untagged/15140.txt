My living room My living roomis a very nice place. It is square. When you enter the room the first thing you notice is the big table in the middle of room and on this table there are three candles. On front of you there is a dresser. On the dresser there are two lamps. There is a beatuiful picture above the dresser. On the left there is single chair and on the right there is a red sofa. I think it is a regular room.
