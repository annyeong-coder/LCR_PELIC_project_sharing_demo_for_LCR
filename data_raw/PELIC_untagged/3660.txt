In the author's point of view children should have endless time in order to be creative. A school that would apply this idea is a school l which provides students with the time they want to spend in a subject or a course. Such school would let children study the subject for the time they would like. For example the school should have flexibility in class duration so when students are in the flow they are not interrupted. The classes of this school wouldn't have certain amount of time but a prediction upon the student interest in the class or at least some classes like art and math. Access to tools and all what students need is necessary in this school. Simply a school with a kinder care system or similar.
