Dekrayat almaalol English 3g May 25 2010 Lost in the airport On Sunday April 25 2010 I arrived in the USA with my husband and my dugher. At 5 00pm the airplan landed in Detroit. The next flight was going to 5 40pm The security process in the airport was very difficult. They needed so much time to finish it. After that Itold them that I had no time because my airplan should be taking off now. Later at the gate the woman there said you came too late . The airplan had taken off. In that moment Iwas very scared. I felt that I was lost. We didn't know what we should do We were angry and crazy. Next We tried to talk with people in the airport. Finally someone helped us He directed us to the next flight to pittsburgh. Then we waited around 2 hours. At 9 00pm we were in the airplan. After 1 hour our airplan landed in Pittsburgh.
