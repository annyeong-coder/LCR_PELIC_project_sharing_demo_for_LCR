In Tanzania and Mozambique Africa use rats to fine bomb or TNT. It is good idea to train a rat to be sniffer rat. Normally many countries use sniffer dogs to find bomb or explosion but they have few points that sniffer rats can work better. First rats are also lighter than dogs. This point reduce death rate of snifters. Second rats are easier to train therefore trainers would get more number of snifters. Lastly rats are needed lower reward. This idea is the best fit for using sniffer rats in Asian because rats stay healthy in tropical areas.
