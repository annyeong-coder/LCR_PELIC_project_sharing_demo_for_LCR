Jetta Corolla American is a nation in the car. If you don't have a car in US your life will be really inconvenient. When you make up your mind to buy a car the first problem you are facing is which car you want to own. For me a student a compact car is the first selection. Mid size is too expensive to my budget Because of the high price of the oil I excluded the possibility of American brands. After some research I chose two cars Jetta Volkswagen and Corolla Toyota. I must select the one through comparing their prices abilities and other criteria. Undoubtedly Corolla is cheaper than Jetta It is the biggest advantage of Corolla. A total new car 'price just is 13 950. The price is so attractive. The same price for Jetta only can have a two years old car. For price Corolla is absolutely better than Jetta. But why is Corolla so cheap An adage in China is the cheap goods is often bad . I think the ability of the car is more important than the price. What about abilities of Jetta and Corolla The engine is the heart of a car. The engine of Jetta is 2. 0L 200hp and Corolla is 1. 8L 126hp. The difference of both horsepower leads to the different drive feeling. When I drive test a Jetta I can easy drive to 80m h but I feel too afraid to accelerate the Corolla just in 60m h. Jetta make me feel tough and safe. But when I drive a Corolla I feel that it is hardly to control the car in high speed. Through drive test both of cars Jetta wins. Another criteria is a private reason. My first car in China is another type car of Volkswagen. It is a good car. I'm familiar with the control panel of Volkswagen. On the other hand I never drive any type of Toyota. I'm strange at Toyota. I vote Jetta because of my personal experience. In conclusion I chose Jetta as my first car in American. Although Jetta's price is higher than Corolla it can give me the better drive feeling.
