Happiness is a wish that everyone wants to achieve. Happiness is influenced by many factors. Helping others Being optimistic and achieving goals results in great happiness. Helping others leads to feeling happy indirectly. For example when someone helps an old man the old man will appreciate his help thereby the helper person will feel satisfied and glad. In my job as a physical therapist I always help patients to feel better. What I did for them makes me pleased. People who are optimistic can alternate negative thoughts to positive thoughts so they will exchange sadness with pleasure. Everyone faces some issues in his life and if he gives up that will end up with unwanted consequences but if he thinks positively he'll overcome those issues and feel felicitous. Reaching targets and achieving goals are always accompanied by gladness. When someone succeeds definitely he'll feel pleased. It was an unforgettable moment when I got my last Job as a teaching assistant in Jazan University. It was the best happiest moment that I've ever had in my life. To sum up happiness can be obtained by cooperation thinking positively and when dreams come true after hard wok. Wise people create their own causes for felicity.
