The film I liked is Titanic . Titanic is an American film directed and produced by James Cameron. It was written about the sinking of the Titanic featuring Kate Winslet as Rose and Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack. Rose and Jack both of who was in different social classes on the Titanic fell in love. The main characters are fictional but some characters who are members of the ship's crew are based on real historical figures. The film began to be producted in 1995 when Cameron recorded the real wreck of the Titanic. It was released on July 2 1997. It got a great commercial success winning eleven Academy Awards including Best Picture. It became one of the highest film all over the world earning a worldwide total of 1. 8 Billion. Titanic still holds the record for highest earning modern film.
