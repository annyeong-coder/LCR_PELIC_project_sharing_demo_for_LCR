I think art can be created by any individual regardless of his or her training. Art is an integral part of being human an expression of our emotions feelings and conditions. Art is not limited to trained artists and can be popular and available to a wide audience. However the depth and complexity of expressions depend on the artist's skills and ability to communicate the ideas clearly.
