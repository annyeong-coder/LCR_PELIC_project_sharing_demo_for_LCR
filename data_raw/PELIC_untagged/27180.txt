Before I moved to the United States I had never shared a classroom with people from different cultures. But now I have been taking English classes with them every day. Since last year I have shared good experiences with people from different countries and I have made some friendships. Living in the United States has been challenging in my life. For instance another thing that I had never done before is that I had never stopped working for a long period of time. I stopped for one year and lately I have been thinking of getting a job but I am afraid of having some communication problems with American people. I am also nervous because I have never had a job interview in English. The kind of job that I am looking for is not related with medicine. I have never worked out of this field but I had thought that this experience could be helpful in the future. I do not like to try new experiences because I am afraid of unknown things. However I have been talking with my husband and some friends and they think that this experience could bring something positive in my life.
