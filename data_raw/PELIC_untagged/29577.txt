My country Colombia which is located in South America has a particular way of teaching manners to children since we have a legacy of Indian manners to raise children. So we are not strict people with children since they can be traumatized. We prefer to spoil children because our Indian ancestors let us do everything. That is to say we are permissive and tolerate many things. Another inappropriate way is not to say your are wonderful. We usually stimulate our children like our ancestor did. Our ancestors reinforced behavior using prizes. Finally in my culture I represent millions of Colombian people in the USA we let children act out their feelings. This is a therapeutic way to feel better.
