This article is the story about Larry Walters who tried to fly by a chair and balloons. He wanted to fly directly from his house but he had no plane and no air strips. He bought many balloons and tanks of helium and tied the helium balloons to a large garden chair. In spite of no experience of flight he got on the chair with little equipments including a rifle and launched it. Surprisingly the chair went to three miles above the Californian coast. He tried to go down by shooting the balloons. He could descend it but couldn't control the destination. The chair hit power cables and it caused a power cut. Finally he came back safely.
