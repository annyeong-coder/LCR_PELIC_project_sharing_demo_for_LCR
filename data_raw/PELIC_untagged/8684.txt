Good man finds all the world friendly . I really like this quotation which remembrances me my mum. She always taught me that I should appreciate and value all friendships that come into my life no matter how deep or superficial. I think I have a lot of friends who accept me trust me and never judge me. My family friends and teachers are people who have affected my life in some way. Also there have been many people who have had big influence in my life. But if I had to choose I would describe my best friend Kristina. She is my seven years best friend who's from Slovakia. Kristina is someone whose personality is completely the same to mine. She means a lot to me. I like her heart which is huge . There were many difficult things problems in my life which I couldn't solve but she was the only one who always stayed with me. She has never said something wrong about me. I do not like people who always tell the lies who want to be the best. There is something different that I appreciate about friendship. I am very happy that I had the luck to meet her.
