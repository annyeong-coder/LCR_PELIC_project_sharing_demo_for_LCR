I think flow is the time when learners reach the point of maximum or high performance as a result of experiencing creativity thinking in their peak point. Even though time is always critical in work there is something in my personality cannot deal with time correctly. Now I realized maybe it is the reason why I experience flow when I feel comfortable and relaxed while I have many things to work on. As I remember the last time I experienced flow was 2 months ago before I arrived at Pittsburgh. In fact there are many factors which contribute to having such a flow in that time and I believe time is the most important among all. In that time I was in a vacation so I started to write a poem as I always do but after that I was surprised at my abilities. Not only time but promoting creativity thinking in schools can enhance learners' ability in future. As children spend most of their time in schools this environment should create an atmosphere which enhance their skills and ability to the maximum level by controlling the factors that affect learners' creativity. Maybe permitting enough time for activities modifying the means of evaluation lowering pressure giving room for more choices can improve the overall performance of children. Also applying the concept of positive reinforcement and group competition can lead to satisfactory results.
