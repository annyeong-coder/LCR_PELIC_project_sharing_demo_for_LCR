A food which I think was good and interesting is Chorizo. I ate Chorizo when I lived in home stay with my friend who have been lived for 20 years in Spain before coming korea. My ex roommate received many foods which were fully filled in a bag from his friend who just arrived from Spain. Chorizo is a fermented cured sausage made by pork in Spain. It is usually cut in slice and eaten without cooking. The Chorizo I ate was already sliced and I put a few slices of Chorizo on a piece of bread. After putting Chorizo I folded by half and tasted with curiosity. The taste of the food was absolutely exotic but pretty good. Specifically the taste was a little bit salty and the Chorizo was a little tough. I think due to the toughness slicing is preferred for Chorizo. However it was mostly sweet and moderately hot. At that time I couldn't imagined that Chorizo is made by pork. I said yummy to my friend and he said that the Chorizo we ate was his favorite among Chorizos in Spain. Since then Chorizo has become one of my favorite food. In addition Chorizo is one of the reasons which made me go to Spain later. When I traveled Spain I rushed to have a hotel's breakfast every morning which provides Chorizos and I enjoyed them as much as possible. The meal I had in Spain can be described as an exotic meal in an exotic place.
