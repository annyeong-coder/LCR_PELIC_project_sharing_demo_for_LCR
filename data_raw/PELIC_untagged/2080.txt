Everyone has their own definition of success. It can be very different or similar each other. For example some people think money is valuable in their life other people don't think like that. One of my friend said her definition of success is to take her goal so she is struggling to take her goal. Another friend said her definition of success is to be happy in her life. I agree with all of them and my definition of success is everything because I want to be happy. If I want to be happy I should try to get everything. I know getting everything can be impossible but I will try to be happy. I have 2 specific ideas to be happy in my life. First I will get really healthy body. I will be strong and then I can do whatever I want. If I want to get health I should exercise and eat well. It sounds really simple but there's only few people doing something regularly so I'll try to be one of them. After I exercise regularly I'll feel good and then I can do something easily and happily. That's why I think health is the most important in my life. I can get my passion with my healthy. Second my family is also important in my life. I already refer that everything is important because they are connected each other. If I want my family to be happy I should be happy first. So after I get my passion I'll use it for my studying and career and then the results of passion will come back to me and my family. After I achieve all of these I can do more and more. Because everything is connected each other so after I achieve something using my passion the passion will come back to me as it's grown up bigger than before. I'm sure that if I try to do something I can get it.
