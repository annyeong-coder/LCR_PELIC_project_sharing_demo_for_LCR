Body of lies. The movie starring Leonardo de capario Russel crow and an Iranian actress. The movie whom I wanted to see sience I saw the commercial have exhibited many political social religious and romantic issues. Decaprio who has played the main character was a CIA agent working in the Middle East especially in Iraq to follow terrorists groups. Crow who is Decaprio boss played a character of cruel man who wants to achieve his goals by any price. The Iranian actress has played a character of Jordanian nurse whom Decaprio has loved. In addition to that the Jordanian intelligence agency has played a strong role in this movie. The movies which had been made in an Arabic country has sent many messages. My favorite scene was that scene in which Crow asked Decaprio why you want to stay in the Middle East Decaprio said that there are many nice things that you cannot see here. There are many confusing parts which I could not understand but there are great parts of this movie too. Finally anybody who wants to see a movie which has action comedy and clean romantic scenes should see Body of Lies.
