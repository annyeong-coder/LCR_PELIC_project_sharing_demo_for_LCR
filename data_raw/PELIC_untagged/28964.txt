Dear Sand First you should've told your boyfriend how you feel before he leaves. Also you can't decide that he just likes you. He might love you. I think you lost your chance with him. Also I think you shouldn't decide impulsive decision. Leaving your job and your whole life without looking back is irresponsible behavior. You should think about the consequences before you decide what you are going to do. Love isn't everything you have to stop thinking about your boyfriend and try to go out and enjoy life and you have got to believe in destiny. So if you meant to be with him you will be sooner or later.
