I had never eaten sushi before I came to the united state. I ordered one plate I thought it is delicious but it was not. I could not ate it. Also I had never spoken with native Americans before I came here I could not understand people easily but with time I'm getting used to that. I had never ever been away from my family more than 3 months before I came here therefore some times I feel homesick.
