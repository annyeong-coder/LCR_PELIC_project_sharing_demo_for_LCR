He has ridden a horse many times also he toke along car trip last year which was to his family. He has not climbed any mountain yet . Ming heats eating something unusual so he has never tried to eat frog or brine of monkey. He is very interested to go camping. Therefor he will has hung out with his friends. Also he toled me that he has not seen any ancient roman ruins. I was so happy when I talked with ming and I appreciate his respond.
