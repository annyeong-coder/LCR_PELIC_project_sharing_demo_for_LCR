Personally I would like to see a gas tax added that was dedicated to research in alternate energy improved gas mileage of cars and solving the commute problem. The problem is of course ensuring that the money obtained this way is actually used for these purposes rather than simply offsetting money moved to other uses. A side benefit of the higher prices would be encouraging consumers to reduce their consumption further increasing incentives for manufacturers to offer more efficient vehicles. I think eventually the higher fuel costs will find their way into everyday living costs but we need to reduce our reliance on foreign oil and that research isn't going to come for free.
