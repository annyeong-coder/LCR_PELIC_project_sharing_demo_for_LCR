Last year one of my friend was late for midterm test about 20 mintutes because the train got accident. The teacher didn't allow her took a test. She tried to explain what happen with her but teacher didn't listen her purpose. So she didn't take a test and that made her study that subject again. She shouldn't have told director he might not have allowed her take a test and she ought to have taken same level. If I was she I shouldn't have asked teacher if you got this accident like me should you have taken similar class In my opinion she shouldn't have allowed my friend take a test.
