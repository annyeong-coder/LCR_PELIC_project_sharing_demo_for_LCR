I think Istanbul is the most challenging city I have ever visited. It is one of the most historical city in the world becuse it has a lot of historic buildings or historical artifact such as Hagia Sophia Blue Mosque Topkap Palace etc. It is an intercontinental city. It has the largest population of all cities in Turkey also one of the most crowded city in the world. In addition to it is the most important finance and business center in Turkey because there are a lot of banks and companies. It is also the most expensive cityi but I think it is the most beautiful city I have ever visited.
