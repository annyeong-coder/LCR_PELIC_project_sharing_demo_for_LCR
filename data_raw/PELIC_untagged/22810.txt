When I rented my room I felt uncomfortable. So I decided to figure out the things which annoyed me. I found out that the light was not enough so I went to Target and I picked out a new lamp shade to light the room up. Then I asked my neighbor to touch the paint up. I put a large mirror up. I took down an old curtain and hung up a new one. Finaly I hung up my children picture's . Now when I enter my room that makes me cheer up.
