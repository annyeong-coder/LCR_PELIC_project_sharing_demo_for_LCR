I interviewed my teacher abut her future plane. What are you going to do in the falls break After taught my grammar class I will go to my office. Then tomorrow morning I will go for a long walk and abut who can take care for my family when I'm here in class I have only two cats and my cats will take care of themselves. In this falls break I'm going to speeder with my family in Pittsburgh. Finally I will decide to teach English every day.
