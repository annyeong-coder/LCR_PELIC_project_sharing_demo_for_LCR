I met my best freind Shahla on my first day in job. We started our first day together and we had the same career. Both of us were looking to find a good freind to spend our free time at work together. So we met and got to know each other so fast because we found that we have a lot of things in common. Then she moved to Canada to complete her education and I came here in pittsburgh but we are still in touch with each other .
