I used to live in Guangzhou China. In those days I used to work out with my co workers. We got used to cooking food and sharing it. Then we used to sing songs and dance. I also used to play cards with my co workers. In the summer. I was used to taking two trips that were organized by the company with my co workers in china. Today I am living in Pittsburgh. USA. And I have no work to do. I am learning English in ELI in UPMC. But my family had two trips to D. C Philadelphia and New York on Thanksgiving Day and on Christmas Day last year. Then we are planning a trip to Disney in Florida this summer.
