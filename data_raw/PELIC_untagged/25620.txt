The Causes of Happiness Preparing for a trip always makes me happy. Imagin what interesting things might happen feels better than a real site appeared before my eyes. Making a reservation at a hotel picking up plane tickets and downloading a map from the Internet always makes me feel excited and happy before I start my journey. First of all making a reservation through the Internet at a hotel always allows my fantasy to run wild. Is there a swimming pool in the hotel Is there a barbecue store in or outside the hotel Does the hotel offer Thai massage service Could I enjoy the gym service for free Does the guest room look toward the beach Will I meet a handsome guy on the street It's a wonderful experience to enjoy these activities do you like it Next when I pick up the plane tickets it implies that a happy journey will start soon. It takes me a long time to compare airline companies because many factors should be considered such as the airline company service the arrival time and the weather conditions. Anyway I feel happy at that moment when I decide to buy a plane ticket. And even happier when I was told that the approximate arrival time of the plane would be late. Last but not least I like downloading a map from the Internet. A map can help me find target my target quickly and I can also find an convenient accommodation near the center of the city. Every site can be visited with the help of a map. Staring at a map as if I was in that place makes me think about doing some nice things. Generally speaking it is a happy experience to prepare for a journey . Even I am informed that my friends want to take a trip I am glad to supply some traveling advice to them . For instance I can recommend accommodation some plane tickets on sale and a good route on the map. If you plan for a trip in the near future please do not forget to tell me! I am a good tour guide!!
