Dear Sand I'm sorry with your sad situation. It is a difficult choice but I think that I could give you some advice. First you should visit your boyfriend and you ought to talk deeply about your feeling and situation. He has to think about that because he must confirm with your relationship. Second I think you are able to work at similar job anywhere so you could look for a new job which is familiar with you at there where he is living. You don't have got to worry about now you may start again with your lovely. I hope that you could make a excellent decision. Good luck!
