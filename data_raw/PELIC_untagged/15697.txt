I used to invent a new item using stereotypes because sometimes I should know about the essential phenomenon related with the item actually I do not know what that is. However this is an easy way to approach something because stereotype does not have complicated feature. So Yueh ANON_NAME_0 ANON_NAME_1 said we have to have stereotypes to deal with so much information in a world with which we are often uncertain and unfamiliar. I totally agree with that statement in that I am using the way. For example I invented a new apparatus with my company's product which was also new in the world. It was a tiny actuator moving back and forth. However nobody tried to change that motion into rotation. Thus I came up with general actuator electrical motor. It could change their rotary motion into linear using some gears. Similarly I applied this method to my apparatus and finally I made it perfectly.
