One thing that I don't like about the US is how changeable the weather is. The thing that I dislike about the US is that eating the fast food and how food affects their health. The most thing that I don't like about the US is how students have to pay for every thing. One thing that I like about the US is systematic their transportation system is. There are many things which I like about the US one of them is how government taking care for elder people. The other thing that I like about the US is that how the rank in education system is.
