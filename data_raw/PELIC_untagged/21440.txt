I think I must take water matches and a computer with internet if I go to a desert. First of all desert is too dry so I might get thirsty. Then water could be the most necessary thing than any others. Also I ought to bring a lot of matches to cook elluminate and heat. Without fire I couldn't do anything especially at night. Last I should take a computer able to work internet wirelessly. I may be in a emergency and wouldn't rescue by myself. So I must need a internet to ineract with others frequently.
