Discussing the Issues p. 96 2. Yes if someone claiming to be psychic offered to help me find a thing or a person I am missing I accept that help with gratitude. First if the psychic person has a true experience in finding things or people it would be the easiest way to search for. Second it can take long time for me to search a thing which is of importance for me if I forgot where I placed it. Third but the most important factor is that if something or someone I was missing really matters for me I do not care how exactly I get to know where is it or where is he she! So I would be grateful for any help in my search even for help from someone who is claiming to be psychic. .
