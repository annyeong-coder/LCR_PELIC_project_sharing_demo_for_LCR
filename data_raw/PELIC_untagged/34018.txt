Hello Dr. Fawzeh Aldrea My son who is 6 years old has a shyness problem. He can't communicate with children in his age also he can't talk to strangers even his teachers. This is his first year in school and I am worried that he will not be able to has a friend or learn from his teacher. What can I do to help him get over his shyness Nora Hello Nora First of all you should know that shyness kids are not bad. They may have nice personality which attract people to be around them. The parent must not consider shyness as a negative quality. Also you had better not say you are shy in a front of your son. Instead you ought to accept this part of his personality and try to improve his confident. He must need more time to study the relationship with the person before he gets close to him or her. You should go to his teacher and explain the situation. The teacher must consider the individual difference between the students. If your son has low self respect then it will become a problem. Otherwise you don't have to worry! Dr. Fawzeh Aldrea
