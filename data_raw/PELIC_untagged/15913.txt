Health care is necessary for everybody since health care is the support of life. Every individual is exposed to diseases and accidents and needs to go to hospitals. Therefore health care is very important for the individual to confront sudden disasters such as car accidents work accidents difficult diseases and burns. Health care in the 21th century has become very expensive and consequently most of people cannot get health insurance. Therefore health care should be provided by the governments for many reasons. One of these reasons is that most of families are big families and parents cannot provide health insurances for all family members which leads many people being without health care which make those individuals need to be provided by any organization. The other reason is that the cost of medicines is very expensive and not everybody can buy drugs especially those who do not have health insurance. Therefore those people should be supported by their governments. In addition to those reasons children should be supported by the society because they should live a good life and have health care. Many people for example cannot take their children to dentists because of high expenses of the dentists. Therefore hospitals and dentists at least for children should be public like schools. Health care should be provided by governments because of expensive of health insurance and drugs. Also our children have to live healthy and they need to be supported to save their future and to counteract the sudden accidents like for instance car accidents or dangerous diseases like cancer.
