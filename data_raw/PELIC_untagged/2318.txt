Centr The First day of 2007 indent In the New Year eve me and my friendswas celebrating our Ead holyday and the New Year eve. We were so thrilled and joyful. After the calibration has been done all of us went home to sleep. That night was quiet and peaceful. I have slept for some hours but after that I woke up early in the morning with the feeling of a bit dizzy. I did not now what's going on with me. Early afternoon I got worse than before and my roommate told me that I must go to the hospital. I thought about it then I said to him ok call one of the guys to take me to the doctor. The guys came and we went to the Emergency. After I got registered I sat down in the waiting area while I was waiting I felt that there was something wrong with my body but I don't know what. I told one of the guys that I must see the doctor immediately and I can't wait more than this. They talked to the hospital and someone came and took me inside. I got Stiffening when I reached the hospital but I don't know why until now. But may be it was from changing the temperature. When the doctor saw me they took some blood to be tested and they gave me Meaningful several times I guess 4 times. After more than five hours they come back and said to me that it was a gastric inflammation. That was maybe because drinking lot of tea and coffee. Finally I went back home with some medicine and took a rest for one week then I felt better.
