Last summer I went to Abha with friends by a car. We were on summer vacation. We stayed there for two weeks. We took some stuff with us for trip such as a tent some food and a camera. We took pictures there for picturesque scenery. Also we rode a cable car to move from area to area. We had camping trip there. We had some adventure in forest . It was the best trip in my life. Thank you
