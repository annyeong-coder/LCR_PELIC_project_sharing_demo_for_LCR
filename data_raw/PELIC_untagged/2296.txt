I went to scale model train fair in Monroeville Expo Center two weeks ago. I have always dreamt to have a maquette train but I hadn't. When I saw this fair ad on TV I felt very happy. At least I would have seen them. I went to Monroeville Expo Center excitedly. This center was much bigger than I thought. After I entered I was confused which side I should go. I decided right side is always better than I started to my tour at that side. All ground was covered buy rug. The ceiling was high and sunlight was coming inside directly. It had a fresh and calming environment. Every field was full of scale model train firms' stands. I couldn't imagine that this fair could be great like this. Above all the center was so organized and tidy. Every spot was separated for one firm. All these firms had prepared special stands for visitors. All of them had different beauties. You couldn't help watching them. The center consisted of two floors. The second floor had been separated for firms and renters. There was much small office. Actually only the first floor was for fair but there was much and large space for all firms and visitors. Even tough there was much space the center was so crowded. Participation to the fair was very high. At the end of the center a small rail road and train had been set up for visitors. Many people were waiting for get on this train. It covered a small area but people got on the train were seen very happy. After three hours I left Monroeville Expo Center with happiness.
