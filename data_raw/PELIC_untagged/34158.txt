My house looks amazing and modern. I decorated it beautifully. It's located in an interesting area where is on Shadyside area and close to walnut street. My neighbors are so friendly and helpful. They are very cheerful reliable and not nosy at all. In addition I have a big yard in front of my house. The yard has a lot of colorful flowers what make my yard so pretty. Also there are some small green trees. Early in the morning some small birds love to sing on the brown branches of the trees. I really love my house which totally looks lovely. I've never seen like my house .
