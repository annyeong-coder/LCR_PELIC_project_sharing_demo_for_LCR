When I thought back on my apartment on the first day it was completely empty but I turned it into a place which you can live in. After I complete furniture my place I touched it up with small curios. If I would like to change something in my apartment I would light it up turn the bed around and throw away all the old things. In addition I love my bad especially when it covered up with a blanket. However I just need to hang up some curtains in my bed room. Usually I turn my TV off but I used to turn my computer on.
