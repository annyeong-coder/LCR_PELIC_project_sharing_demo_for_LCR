Helen Keller was one of the most amazing women in the world. When she was a baby she became deaf and blind because of an unknown disease. By the time she could not listen and speak. She wasn't able to learn to use language like normal people. After awhile she met a very great teacher ANON_NAME_0 Sullivan and she was able to learn English through her after trying very hard. Later Helen Keller became a very successful student and even graduated from college. Also she could write books about her experiences and gave a lot of lectures to people all over the world. Her amazing life story and courage is an inspiration for all of us. We can learn form her experience that we should never bow down to difficult situations.
