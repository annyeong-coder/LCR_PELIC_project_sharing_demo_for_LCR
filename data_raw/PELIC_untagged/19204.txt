Two weeks ago I lost my wallet near the cathedral of learning. I went to class and didn't know that it fall from my bag. When the class was over I went to buy me a cup of coffee and when I wanted to pay I discovered that my wallet is gone. I was upset and immediately went looking for it. I thought maybe it fell from my bag in class or when I went to the restroom it wasn't there. I came home really upset and angry about my self I was very sad. An hour later while I was reading my emails I discovered a big surprise I got a mail from somebody who found my wallet!!! I was so lucky. I sent him an email back and went to take the wallet from him. Nothing was missing. Until today I don't know how he knew my email address I forgot to ask him that
