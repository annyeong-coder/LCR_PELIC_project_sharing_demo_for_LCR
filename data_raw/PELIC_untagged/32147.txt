The girl that hit the car the men followed her and started bitting her. A lot of people saw but nobody did anything. The girl that was attacked by a man and 38 people saw but nobody helped her. In a big city if someone look at the sky nobody looks. If a lot of people look at the sky all the people look at the sky too.
