Last weekend my home stay host went to NYC. So their house was watched by me. Under my house keeping I had the house remained fine until their return on last Sunday. However something was still massed up by me. On Friday the very beginning of last weekend I had a mailbox received. I was waiting a mailbox therefore to ensure if that was my mailbox or not. I had decided to open it immediately when received it. That was a mistake I should have ever made. While it was carefully being opened by me I used a pair of scissors to cut a tiny breach. Oh! MY! GOSH! I had my grandma's clothes cut. S Beep T !!!
