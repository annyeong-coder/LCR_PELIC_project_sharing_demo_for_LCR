When I first came here everything is very unfamiliar and courage. For example when someone called me I had to talk me into if I didn't know who call me. Also although I couldn't receive a call I afraid to call him back. A month ago I think I receive a call from stranger so I thought over a little time and then I told her. Hold on please. And I gave my phone to my cousin. Of course I wanted to go on a conversation with her but I gave up again. However now I try to change my mind. So if someone calls me I try to figure out what he's saying. In my mind I might want that someone who is native call me. It's very hard to understand but I have to. At least I will try to keep on a conversation. After then I will go over my conversation and I will hang up the phone call.
