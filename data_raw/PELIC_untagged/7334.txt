I have already traveled to some places of Korea. I sometimes used to travel around Korea. Before I came in US I went to Pyeong Chang in 2006 and spent a lot of time taking a rest on beautiful beaches. However Coming in USA for studying English is my first time to go abroad. And I have never gone oversea but I would like to. And then I'd like to have trip around USA. USA has huge territory. I guess it might have many kinds of scenic spots. Then I'm planning a vacation trip. On august 5 I will go to trip around USA. Maybe I will go to the Grand Canyons and Seattle.
