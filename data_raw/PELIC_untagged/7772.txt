I have been playing baseball since I was 10. I have been playing as a pitcher. When I was a high school student I had matches twice a month. This year I have played 6 matches. When I was a freshman of college I studied English. It has been a long time since then. Now I have been studying English for 2 years. I have been studying bible at the shurch since I came the U. S.
