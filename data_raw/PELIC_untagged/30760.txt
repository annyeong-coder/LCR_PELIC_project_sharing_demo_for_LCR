The crows learn other how to make people a source of interest when they fall the nuts In front of the car. Then they eat the nuts when the light turns red. The crows have a lot evidence that proving them and other animal to learn and think. The crows put coins in the machine to bring the nuts. The crows seem to understand what relationship between the machin and coins. People are able to develop the crows to do something useful. We can get on the ability to climb when we learn how to climb from geckos. In future there will be a large participation between people and animals if the people permitted for the animal survive by providing protective environment for the animals.
