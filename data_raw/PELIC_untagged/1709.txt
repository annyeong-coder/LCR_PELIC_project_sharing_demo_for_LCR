Two important areas of my life are my family and my friends. I'm the oldest of 5 children. If I hadn't been born my parents would have been very sad . They are always proud of me. They were looking forward to participate into my graduation and to my wedding ceremony . If I hadn't been born they might have waited too much to feel those feeling because my siblings are very young to get married If I hadn't been born. My best friend Amani might have felt very lonely because she loves to share her secret only with me. If I hadn't been born my mother could have missed her friend because we are a very close. If I hadn't been born my father might have saved some money rather then paid my tuitions for school and college. But thanks god I'm alive.
