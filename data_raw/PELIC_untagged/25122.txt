Chinese New Year In China people celebrate for the spring every year. We call it Chinese Lunar New Year. In this holiday people gather their family to celebrate the Lunar New Year's coming. There are three important things that must be done preparations family reunion dinners and celebration in temples. In order to get ready firstly people buy a great many of flowers such as chrysanthemum peach blossom narcissus kumquat and so on. Different flowers have different allegories. For example kumquat means good fortune. Next people buy fruits and candies. Then people would clean their homes. Finally people decorate their homes with flowers and in red. In fact Chinese Lunar New Year is not only a traditional holiday but also a day for family reunions. On this day people who work in other localities all year round also go home to celebrate and have family reunion dinners. Therefore family reunion dinners are very important to Chinese people in New Year's Eve. At first people cook lots of food early in the morning. Then they set the food on altars as offerings to their ancestors. Eventually people get together to have family reunion dinner. On the first day of New Year most of the people go to temples. They prepare food at home and bring it to the temples. Then they buy incense for Buddha in order to get blessings. People believe the first one to set incense will bring himself the most of blessings. Frequently we can see seas of people waiting behind the line anxiously. At a certain time the bells are rang and the line is dropped. You would see them rushing into the temple to try to be the first. After going to temple most people share the food with their families. The Chinese New Year is made of three parts. Preparations are the most time consuming for housewives. Family dinners are always an essential part. A visit to the temple concludes the Chinese New Year. In this holiday people thank for the past and look forward to the future.
