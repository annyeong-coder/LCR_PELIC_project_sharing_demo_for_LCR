When I was in high school I used to play basketball with my best friends after class . We used to play 3 hours every day and then we go back home together. When I arrive home I used to drink 2 cups of orange juice and then eat dinner with my parents. And then I used to spend 3 hours to do my homework . Finally I used to go to bed on 11 pm.
