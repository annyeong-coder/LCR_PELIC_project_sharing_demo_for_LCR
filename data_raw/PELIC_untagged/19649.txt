I have been realized my situation. I should work hard get my TOEFL score as quick as possible. I have been regret I missed the many time here. Also I have been gained 20 pounds here. American food is very easy to gain weight. So I have been learned some chinese food. I have been decided to lose weight. I have been made some friends and known many good teachers. I am really happy to get on with them.
