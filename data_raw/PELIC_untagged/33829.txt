2. I lived with my parents and my sibling who you've met. 3. I had two sisters and older brother whom I felt a close connection to my sisters. 4. My sisters and I shared a room where we spent nights talking. 5. My brother whom I hardly ever saw slept on the living room couch. 6. It was a large old couch where my father had made it by himself. 7. My best friend whom family I loved lived across the hall. 8. We went to the same school where we both studied English. 9. Mr. Robinson who everyone was a little afraid of was our English teacher. 10. After school I worked in a bakery where my aunt and uncle owned. 11. They sold delicious bread and cake which people stood in line for hours to buy. 12. My brother and sister whom I miss live far away now. 13. When we get together we like to talk about the old days when we all lived at home.
