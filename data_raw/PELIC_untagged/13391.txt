The best meal I've ever had During my college years I enjoyed the beast meal I have ever had in my life in Kaoshiung. The meal was a bowl of Chinese beef noodles in soup and the flavor is still unforgettable. What contained inside were several pieces of beef and bunch of noodles. To tell the truth the noodles and beef were just so so but the soup was amazing. I could taste the strong flavors of beef tomatoes and onions at one sip. More specifically these flavors were mixed altogether with excellent balance and none of them are stronger than others. There might be some crucial ingredients that had been used in order to make the soup unique but I had no idea what it might be. The only thing I remember now is the flavor of the soup and the location of their restaurant.
