Last year I went to England to have fun. I think that I used many wrong words that caused some problems for me in restuarant malls and puplic restrooms. I could have had worse situation than what I really faced. However I didn't have to warry about that because misunderstanding can happen anywhere. I'm sure my proplems in England must have repeated with others. But I might have avoided some proplems by preparing for those situations. It can't be imposseple but that time I may have forgotten what I was used to doing in travel. I could have taken my guiding book evreywhere. I think that all the story turns out to that I must prepare will. Anyway The results should appear next trip.
