About 3 years ago I met my husband and then he required me to marry him. I ought to have quit job. I could have told my boss I was moving to another country. I should have said sorry to him because he wants to advancement my job. I couldn't have accepted it. When I told him he was so sad I shouldn't have told him. It might've been better.
