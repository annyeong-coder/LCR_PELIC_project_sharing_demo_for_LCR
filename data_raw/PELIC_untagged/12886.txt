In twenty countries on five continents millions of children are being lured into nicotine addiction by U. S. Cigarette. Moreover most children begin to smoke between ages 12 and 16. Even though smoking is one of the causes of premature death linked to cancers American tobacco companies and government are promoting smoking among the world's children. Consequently some developing countries have banned cigarette commercials on TV and radio in order to protect young people. However U. S. Tobacco companies have never stopped advertising. They spent 100 million sponsoring sports last year to show tobacco logos which made children appeal to cigarette. In addition Cigarette advertising focuses on the outside of the United States so the U. S. Has one of the lowest smoking rates of the population. You can stop this outrage by writing a letter to the President of the United States. In my opinion I agree to prevent children from smoking cigarettes. Tobacco companies should not lure children into cigarettes due to earning money. Moreover the U. S. Government should educate children about dangerous effects of cigarettes. If young people try smoking a cigarette they may addict at the first time. Once a body is addicted to nicotine it's very hard to stop smoking. Furthermore smoking can cause cancers and serious health problems in not only smokers but also nonsmokers. Therefore smoking cigarettes are supposed to be stopped especially in children. Cigarettes can destroy the nation hope.
