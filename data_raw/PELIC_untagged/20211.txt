The natural disaster is a serious problem in many countries. As a result of the disaster everything would be out of control. We should know the effects of a natural disaster such as an earthquake or hurricane. There are three main effects. First effect is about people. Houses would be destroyed by the earthquake. Because of this people might lose their houses. Buildings trees houses or everything on the road would collapse so it is not safe to go out during the earthquake. Due to the falling stuff people would get hurt. Second effect is about society. If the scale of the natural disaster is too significant many stores will shut down. We can not buy something we need or meet our friends in the store. We also can not go out by public transit. Buses taxis or cars can not be drove during the natural disaster. For this reason the traffic everywhere would be a big problem. Without stores and the traffic transportation we can not do social activities. The last effect is about country. We can not go to work during the natural disaster so there will be some troubles in commercial activities. It will also affect the economy in the country. After the natural disaster government has to set up a team to resolve the problem. They need many resources to use. If there is a lack of resource people will lose their patience. Because of this the government might lose their trust. All of these effects are in our life. We need to know. We can use many methods to prevent it. If we have the best way to prevent it the effect will not be serious. Do not think it is not my business. This is the responsibility we should keep in our mind.
