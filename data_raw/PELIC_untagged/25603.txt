My apartament is great! He is very confortable and spacious but I need to change somethings there! First I want tear down a green wall because I don't like this color collor painted in a wall. Then I want cover up this wall in white color. After that I want put up a beautiful painting in this wall. I also need straighten up my closet and my apartament and throw away what I don't need more finally I need pick up my shoes of the living room. Iguess my apartament a little bit dimmer because that I need to put more lights around him and turn on all ligths! I like a clear and bright place!!! Finally after this things I can have a wonderful apartament.
