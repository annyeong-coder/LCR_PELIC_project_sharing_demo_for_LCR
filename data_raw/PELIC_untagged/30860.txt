Fridays And Sundays If you see me at Sunday night you would never believe that it's the same person who you met on Friday. I have different activities to do and I think and feel differently in these two days. Although these two days are close to each other and have some same features they have totally different properties. First difference is the companions. I have different people to spend my time with. On Fridays I usually meet my classmates to share our academic experiences and have some gossips with my friends. However my family takes the first place on Sundays. We likely to have family gathering meet relatives and discuss our family's issues. Second the activities that I used to do on Fridays are not the same one that I do on Sundays. Despite of having changing activities on Fridays such as going for shopping watching movie my activities on Sunday consider to be routine tasks confine of doing chores or running errands. Finally Fridays and Sundays have two different effects on my mood. On Fridays I feel so excited during the day and very optimistic while Sundays I have feeling of bored and I get worried of what might next week carry for me. In spite of these differences that Fridays and Sundays have these two opposite days of week share several features. First similarity Fridays and Sundays have is the sleeping time. I the same way that I go to the bed at late time in Fridays I sleep after 12 am on Sundays trying to enjoy my weekend as much as I can. Second both Fridays and Sunday I like to eat homemade home making up of all kind of junk food that I've ate during other weekdays. Finally the time that I spend to study on both Fridays and Sunday are mostly same. Like Fridays I use to eliminate my studying length time on Sundays to save my energy to concentrate on studying on Saturdays. In conclusion Fridays and Sundays meet on some same aspects as much as they have so different properties.
