With my personality I have to have many works in the office. When I worked in last job work load was really weak so I had nothing to do in a day. I just wasted my time. I should have studied something like work related studies or English. My work off time was 5 o'clock. But my boss started to give me work right before 4 o'clock and told me. 'You must finish this before you go home'. For several days late assignments were repeated. I thought the boss ought to have given work earlier so that I could finish work until work off time. I was angry for the late order. So I said to my boss to quit the job. The boss should have persuaded me not to quit the job. If so I might not have regretted. After that I had to wait several years to get new job.
