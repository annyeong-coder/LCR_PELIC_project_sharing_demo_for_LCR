I prefer to live in this present era for different reasons. One reason it's not enough to read or watch movies to predict how the live in other time period would look like. In contrast I've had real experiences beside knowledge since I've already been here. Another reason although human is an adaptable creature. However change is difficult special I'm not in that small age that accepts such this adventure. The third reason the size of freedom adverse responsibility is an important balance. I think that making another choice for my life would affect people around. For instance person's life conceders the society that start from the small society family to the big society. There are common life and mutual feelings between the people each others. If we forget this connection that mean we are selfish. The most important reason is that everyone owns some constituents of living here and so do I. For example I've had collective information consists with our live here. It just needs me to use and transfer it to knowledge that could help me to accommodate. Last but not least hoping other time of life to live in is runaway. In my opinion escaping from the real chances which have been given us to unknown chances is a big problem. I feel that if we can't be grateful for this life we can't be grateful for other life.
