My name is Student's Name 24 years old from Korea. I like to exercise at the gym and to swim at the pool. These days I'm going Petersen Events Center and Bellefield Hall in the University to exercise. I will graduate the University here that's the reason why I have come here. First I'm going to go CCAC then I will transfer to the University of Pittsburgh or Canegie Mellon University. So I'm preparing to go there.
