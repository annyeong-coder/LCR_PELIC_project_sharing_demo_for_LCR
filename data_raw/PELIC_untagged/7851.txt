Hi I'm Name . I grew up in Spain. My father always has liked to walk in the open country. For this reason since I was so young I have done long trips with him. But sometimes if you have been doing something for many years it can become like an obsession so one day I dropped out of this activity. Since then I have been riding bicycle frequently for ten years so now I can say that I'm an expert on bikes. I have put several photos of trips with my father and others on bicycle.
