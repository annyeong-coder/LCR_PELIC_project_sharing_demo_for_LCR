I think the most interesting city is the Seoul. The Seoul has something that is the most interesting is funny to me. First of all the Seoul has most of the most important building in the Korea and the Seoul is better than another citys in the Korea. Besides the Seoul is as big as the another big city in the Asia. For example the Seoul is as big as the Tokyo or Beijing. Moreover the Seoul has the most interesting place in the Korea. Also the Seoul is as busy as the big city such as the New York. In addition the Seoul has some of the busiest shopping mall and the Seoul has some of the biggest shopping center. Also the Seoul has some of the best scenic spot in the Korea. It also is as good as the big city in the world. Sometimes the Seoul has the most confused to someone who visited at firsttime. For instance traffic location people etc. Anyway the Seoul is the best city to me.
