Living in two different cities is one of the most intersting thing I have been through. When I came to pittsburgh I found many differences and similarity between Pittsburgh and my hometown Dammam. People who lived in two different cities can learn many things more than people who just lived in their own city. However there are differences such as beach weather and the bridges. And few similarties for example the size locatin and both cities are industrial cities. Dammam has really hot weather in the summer and a nice weather in the winter but Pittsburgh has really nice wither in the summer and so frigid in the winter it is like the opposite thing btween these cities. Also Pittsburgh has a lot of bridges but dammam has few bridges Because there is no rivers in my city. If you take a look at Pittsburgh you are going to see many mountain but Dammam is a littoral citiy which has a beach. Although Dammam has huge oil which made it an industrial city Pittsburgh is one of the most industrial city in U. S. A. Both cities have the same location which is in the east side of the country. In addition Dammam is about the same size as Pittsburgh in a way and they both have about the same population which is three million. I think living in two differents cities is learning something new in your life when I lived in pittsburgh I realized that I learn many things more than I have expected. With all the differences in both cities it was difficult for me to live with new society that I had to live with. It was a good opportunity to meet new people with diffierent society.
