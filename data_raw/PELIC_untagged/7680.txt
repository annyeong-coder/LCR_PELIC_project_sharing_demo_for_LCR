I met my Prof. Laih when I decided to move to Tainan and entered the National Cheng Kung University to get my master degree. That was more than three years ago. He gave me a lot of chances to challenge my ability and guided me through my difficulties while I was losing my life direction. While I was studying for my master degree I began to be enthusiastic about researching information security. The research was hard to me and needed several aspects of government resources. Prof. Laih asked the government to support the budget and encouraged me to complete my research while I was hesitating whether I should give up the research or not. In my master life I was confronted by two different conversions and I lacked confidence in myself. The first conversion was that I broke up with my boy friend because I always had no time to deal with our relationship. While I was working for my company and studying for my degree I started to write for the technology magazine. That was too tired to doing everything well. Prof. Laih advised me to think of what is important to me. Then he suggested that I should pick one or two tasks up and give others up. I decided to quit my job to be a full time student. That's what I'm doing now. Prof. Laih has had a profound influence in my life. He is my most respectable teacher and like my another father to teach and support me. It's my honor to meet him.
