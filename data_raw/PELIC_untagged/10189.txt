People usually have general idea of every certain stereotype of people such as nationalities. Some people might judge you about your nationality by their standard if they know where you come from. For example some people think that Taiwanese and Japanese girls have a wild perspective of sex than other Asian girls other Asian girls are too conservative. What they said is not true but it hurts when people know about your nationality. Some people do make me puke when they give me some obscene innuendo.
