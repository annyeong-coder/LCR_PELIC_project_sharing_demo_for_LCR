Yesterday I called up the Honda car dealer shop to make an appointment to get a recall service. Someone picked up the phone and I cleared my situation up. As soon as she listened it she passed my call out to somebody. I thought she didn't figure out what I meant because of my Korean accent. I waited for 10 minutes to talk with a worker and someone hung up the phone before I explained what I wanted. At this moment I wanted my husband helped me out since he speaks English fluently. However my husband refused it and I worked this problem out by myself.
