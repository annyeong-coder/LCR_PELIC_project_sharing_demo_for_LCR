If I could live in any time period I would live in now. During my life sometime I have thought about that. In other words I wish I would be in past. I know the history such as culture politics and war. So if I could live in past I would be able to get everything I think. But When I got the assignment I think about that I would live in any time very carefully. So eventually my answer is now because I have good friends family. If I could live in past or future I wouldn't meet my friends and family. I don't want that. Especially I love my family. Good father mother and sister all of them are my valuable property. Although I could get a lot of property in the past I wouldn't change my own property now.
