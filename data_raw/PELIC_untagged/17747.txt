When I first time tried to call AT T and tried to buy a phone it was so difficult. I wanted to use my Chinese credit card to pay the money and I told them my card information. The person who talked to me asked me hold on second and she putted down my information in the form. When she tried to put the card's nation there only has unite state. So I can't use my Chinese card to buy this phone. The woman who talked to me tried to talk me into use American bank card. I thought that it was fine so I told her that I would call her back after I got my card and I hang up the phone. But when I got my card and I tried to call her the phone number was wrong so I gave up. Finally I bought my phone in the AT T shop.
