When I was in high school I didn't use to have many friends. I used to have only one. Her name is Melissa. We used to spend a lot of time together. We always used to do our homework together after class. When I visited her in her house her mother used to bake some cookies for us. We used to live in the same city until she got married. When we finished high school I moved to another city as well and we didn't use to talk so often. I only used to call her every year in her birthday. I missed those days when we used to do everything together. We were like a sisters.
