When surnames began appearing in Europe 800 years ago a person's identity and occupation were often intertwined. In other words a surname was a direct link between who a person was and what the person did. For example Taylor is the old English spelling of tailor. Another example is Clark which is derived from clerk an occupation of considerable status during the Middle Age because it required the literacy. In addition a walker was someone who cleaned cloth. Moreover a wright was a carpenter or metalworker. Furthermore a carter was someone who drove a cart. Also a steward was a person in charge of a farm or estate. Beside that a turner worked a lathe. Finally one of the few occupational surnames reflecting the work of women is Webster which refers to a female weaver.
