In the past several years we have become much more aware of hazardous conditions in the environment. For example scientists recently reported that ozone the natural shield protecting us from the sun's ultraviolet rays has declined significantly. Also they noted that a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica has developed and blamed the widespread use of certain chemicals for the ozone decrease. In addition scientists have warned us about the greenhouse effect the gradual warming of the earth because the heat from the sun's rays is prevented from radiating back into space by a blanket of artificial gases. An example of the chief gas in the greenhouse effect is carbon dioxide a byproduct of burning fossil fuels in cars and factories. Furthermore waste disposal has become a significant problem. We not only have tons and tons of household garbage to get rid of but we also have hazardous waste from nuclear facilities and plants. In conclusion while all of these are significant problems that must be solved in the near future at least we are now more aware of them.
