When I was young I heard the phone ranging I picked up the phone talked over and said hello. But I couldnt hear anyone so I hanged up the phone. But after a while the phone ranged again and I thought that he called back I picked up the phone but this time I heard and echo. I tried to talk over but all I heard was my echo after I told my father about that and he picked up the phone he realized that my cell phone in my pocket was calling the phone I laughed but I still cant forget how stupid I was.
