I will be on the Desert Island with group for five weeks and we can take only three items. I think we have to take a knife. On the Island there must have some wild animals and with a knife we can secure ourselves. We can use the knife to kill animals and cut them for eating. I think we should take matches. With matches we can start a fire and with the fire we can cook something to eat and warm ourselves. We can take a solar powered computer. We can save some movies music stories before we go to the Island. Then we could not be very boried on the Island.
