Dear Ms. Perry An interested in counseling specialization I was pleased to find the counseling master program in the university. I believe this program achieves my ambitions as you will discover while viewing my resume. Psychology has always been a significant part of my life. Studying in school I was interested in courses that are related to psychology. Although finding some difficulties in applying for psychology program in King ANON_NAME_0 University in first semester I was accomplishing my dream while I finished my first year in collage. I was able to instill a deep prospective of counseling by sailing in a various topics in psychology. Graduating from collage I had train in three different hospitals. Meeting patients and studying cases I fall in love in hospital field . I know that this what I want to be and I decided to specialize in mental health for my high diploma. I hope you accept me in master program in counseling psychology. Should you require any further information please contact me. Appreciate you cooperation. Sincerely Fadwa Tarabolsi
