Since Rupert always goes to class he might have missed them because he broke his arm. However if this is a possibility he could have called to the director of school and has communicated he was injured. He also should have missed test and now he must probably make up others class during the summer. Then he may not enjoy his summer completely. In sum he should have communicated to his school his problem.
