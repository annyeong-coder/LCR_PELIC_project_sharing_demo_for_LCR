Almatrek where I grew up is a small village located in south of Saudi Arabia. I remember many events that happened when I was child. Our old house which has four rooms was next to my uncle's house. My uncle's son and I used to play in the yard where was between two houses when we returned from school. I remember that day when was beginning of the weekend when my uncle punished his son and me because we had broken the window. When I was eight years my family moved to the house which we are still living in. In the beginning was difficult for me to adapt with a new situation because I did not know new children who were our new neighbors and I missed the children who were our old neighbors and my uncle's son. After several months I made a lot of friends whom I spent all time with. We were always sitting in front of the grocery store where is located in the center of neighborhood. The highest income for this grocery store was in the summer when majority of villagers returned to spend their vacations in the village.
