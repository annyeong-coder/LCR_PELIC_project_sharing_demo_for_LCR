When I was a high school student at almost last term I suffered all the time from anxiety about choosing kinds of Universities. After I got the consequence of test like SAT of America I thought I should have studied harder. In fact I hadn't done my best for last 3 years. I could have been accepted middle level Universities with my grade. Of course I could have gone any Universities. But if I went there I wouldn't have been satisfied. So I decided that I would try to take it again next year. If I decided another choice I might have been another man. I think my decision must have been even better.
