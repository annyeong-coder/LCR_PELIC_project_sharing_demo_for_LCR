If I feel bad for some reasons. I usually change my room decoration. When I changed my room decoration. It feels me cheer up. I can figure out my problems by myself. First of all I take off my slipovers. Next I take down my bed. Then I throw out some posters on the wall because my room need to be light up. After I pick up my curtains to wash them. I touch up my desk with my nem pictures. I fix up my room perfectly. Finally Ilook over everythingh in m y room. Now it looks like welfare for studying and sleeping.
