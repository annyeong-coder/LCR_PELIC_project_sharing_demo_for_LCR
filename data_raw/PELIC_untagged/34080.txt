How to find your true love In today's modern society many friends could not find their true loves. Some of them say they are too busy to settle down yet some of them may think they cannot live someone they do not love. In China my grandparents generation couples got marriage without knew each other ahead but they lived together for the rest of their lives. Nowadays people have tangs of time to get to know each other but they could not find the Mrs. Right or Mr. Right. Or they got marriage and then divorced afterwards. From my perspective people need know who they are and how to live with a person grew up in a different family. Love is miracle but not the only aspect to consider a marriage because marriage ought to base on each part's support understanding respect and compromise. For example a dating couple have been living with each other for 10 years and they love with each other but just not get marriage because they do not want to give each other pressures. What is true love If you love your partner I think you should be able to take the pressure of marriage. If you are the one be loved by your partner you ought to understand the meaning of live and marriage. Again love is the one reason we get marriage but it is not strong enough to keep the marriage. As a married couple we must considerate the other person's opinion and make decisions together.
