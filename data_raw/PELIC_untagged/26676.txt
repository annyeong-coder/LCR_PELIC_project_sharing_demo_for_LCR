I was born in Seoul Korea in 1988 When I was studying in elementary school I started the girl scouts. I learned drawing and painting when I became a highschool student. I was starting assistant tutor in Painting Institute while I was starting the university. I participated the exhibitions which are Desigh Festival and Desigh Olympic while I was studying about Industrial design. When I quit the assistant tutor I prepared to go to United states. I am studying English in Pittsburgh.
