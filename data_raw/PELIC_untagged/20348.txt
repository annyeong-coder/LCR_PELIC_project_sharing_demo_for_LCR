I was born at a small village which is called Kalaah where most of my relatives were living. In addition its weather is similar as Pittsburgh but no snow. Most of my friends whom I like talking to were growing up at the same village. Moreover I had been finishing my high school at this village before I moved out to the capital city of my country in which the weather is too hot and the people gathered from different countries. However I visit my hometown every year in order to remember the amazing days that I had been spending in.
