There are many people who are respected all over the world. I also respect a lot of people one of them is my mother. When I was young she taught me to have mercy on people who could be worse than I. And she is a doer. Even though we were not rich she helped some orphans and lonely old woman. If I were my mother I could not do that. In addition she suggested that I become a person who gives help. I thought it was not important at that time but my thought is changing. It is crucial that I help people who need help. Next the other person is my middle school teacher who was passionate to his students. He always insisted that students study hard. It is essential that every people do their best and students' best is to study. Last I respect my maternal grandmother. She was one of Christians who obey the word of God. She asked that her descendants obey the word of God. And she was a doer. I think it is necessary that I live with God.
