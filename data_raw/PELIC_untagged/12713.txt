Wilt Chamberlain and Bill Russell were both the most famous basket ball players. They played in 50s and 60s and they were both the most skillfully players on their teams. I like Bill Russell more than Wilt Chamberlain because I think Bill Russell more powerfully than Wilt Chamberlain and he played better than Wilt Chamberlain in some of his games. Bill Russell more carefully than Chamberlain and he was catching the ball faster than Chamberlain. Chamberlain was the least consistently and the most aggressively of any player on his team but he was the most frequently three points shooter
