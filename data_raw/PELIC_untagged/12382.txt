Tom Higgins was dream to open restaurant so few years later he opened his dream restaurant in Benson University. So he thinks only his restaurant will be most good place so he didn't carry some things. On the other hand there are many restaurants in there location. Several times later his customer's number was decreasing. In his restaurant there are three main reasons why his dream restaurant losing his customers. The restaurant had too many rules he forget he most customers are student so student don't like rules. First in his restaurant rules said no bare feet so he is loosing the customs beliefs. Second some guys like to smoke but he didn't agree to smoking so guys choosing other restaurant. Finally American young people most of them like skateboard but he said no skateboards so young people not choosing his restaurant. There aren't enough too expensive to students. First of all thing student are not reach people they usually chose little bet cheap thing. Second his restaurant is one Hamburger cost 8. 95 So most customers chose other place to eat. His restaurant surrounded by many other restaurants. He want lower parse but other place can be lower. If his restaurant was only one restaurant of that place he can do he want. Customers have too many choices to eat. If customers didn't like some thing then they go other place.
