There are many universal gestures we use it everyday. Sometimes these gestures are ancient. For example when everyone rise his hand and move it that instead of Hi for speech. We can found that in different countries. I thing all the humanity should be make system to combination the gestures that will be good way to agreement around the world. This way will be grow from generation to generation. Like preal system for the deaf. I thing this system will be give us more communication more realize between the world cultures and that will be start to new international language.
