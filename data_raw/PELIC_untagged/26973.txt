Kinds of friends There are many kinds of friends that you met or will meet them. Usually people make friendship for period of time. Like old friends who I met them in the past from primary school until college a lot of these relationships continue up to today. Now I have new friends here in Pittsburgh. We can classify the friends to two classifications good friends and bad friends. Good friends who take care of you and you trust them. Usually good friends share you funny and hard times. But bad friends you can't trust them and you can't give them your secrets. Bad friends will leave you alone when you need them. Finally everyone has friends but I think one or two of them will stay with you forever and the others will leave.
