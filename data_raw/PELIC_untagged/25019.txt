About 100 languages are recognized as official languages by other nations such as India and Russia. Minority Languages the most useful languages eliminate others.

Teaching English is a growth industry Widely used languages Graddol's repor Chinese will continue its predominance in 2050 with Hindi Urdu and Arabic climbing past English among 15 to 24 year olds. A proliferation of non English sites Mandarin will be must learn language Minority Language 90 of the 6 000 languages may be extinct. I think the second one is more persuasive.
