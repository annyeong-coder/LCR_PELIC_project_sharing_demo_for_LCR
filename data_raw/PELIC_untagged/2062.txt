My stay in pittsburgh. When I arrived at piits. At first I was so nerveous and intensive. The winter sky of that year was seemed to be more grey and dark to my eyes. But nowdays 2 years later I'M ENJOYING drinking a cup of coffee in starbucks with chattering with my friends getting rid of kid's crying voices. I'm very satisfide with this pitts. Life. Of course studying english IS NOT EASY for me. I must rush to a empty parking lot every in the morning get up early for wrapping my lunch. Sometimes I need to leave before finishing my class for pickking my treasures up. The other sometimes taking care of them and doing houseworks and a lot of homework are mixed. But learning something new is still my pleasure. I'M NOT GOING to stop studying.
