I need to touch up my bedroom because it's big and messy. It was painted a long time ago. There are a lot of things I have to do. At first I need to paint all the walls. I want to do it without mistakes because I don't want to do it over. After that I want to straighten it up. Then I am planning on hanging my clothes up. I also want to put posters up on the walls. But I also want to leave some panting on the walls. I also need to move around some furniture. Then I need to throw out the unnecessary things. Finally I need to turn the bed around. I hope that my wife will like the touches and that it will be perfect so I don't need to redo it.
