Last Februay I started a relationship with a girl. She was the most beautiful girl I had never seem before and I knew I had fallen in love since the first time I saw her. But it didn't be easy to win her love. I had been doing everything I could for two months before she finally accepted. Now I have come to US so I cannot stay with her. But both of us have been trying to keep our relationship and we will see what happen.
