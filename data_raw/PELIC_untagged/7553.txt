I usually oriented to digital but in a writing I oriented to analog. I mean I usually using a computer but I like to write everything such as taking note writing diary and just memo. Therefore writing essay is not difficult to me despite I make a lot of grammar mistakes. As time passed I am use to writing English essay. After graduate school I never wrote a piece of paper so it was difficult at first. However recently I feel it is comfortable. Also since I prepare for TOEFL test I have practiced to write small essay and my thinking ability has improved. This is because a lot of essays require my opinion and I should set up my thinking to agreement or disagreement. In addition nowadays I try to write English e mail to my future university. I ask how to apply and some unsure things.
