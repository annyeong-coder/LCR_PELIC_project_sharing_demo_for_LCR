The speaker said that the third method is about yourself not other person and this does not involve returning anger for anger. Then she explained by telling the story of two sisters Rosa and Alicia and why they came for help resolving a family dispute. The sisters told Sands what they were arguing about. Rosa said that Alicia had always gotten everything because she had been their mother's favorite. Alicia's feeling got hurt because of what her sister said. Therefore Alicia said that the problem was that Rosa was very selfish person instead of telling Rosa how she felt about what she said. The other thing that Alicia could said to her sister was that she had felt really disrespected.
