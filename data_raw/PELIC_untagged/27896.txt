Nowadays when someone gets old they usually go life in a care center or in a home with other old people where there are nurses to look after them. It is easier for their children to keep them in the care center than taking care of them by their own. However old people shouldn't be allowed to go to the care center by their children because their children should take care of them and old people likes to be surrounded by their families. Old people must be taken care of by their own children. Their own children are the best person that can take care of their old fathers or mothers. Because they now their traits and what do they like and dislike. They have the best qualification for this job. Nurses may be careless but their children wouldn't be. And as their parents took care of them when they could now their children must return the favor and help them. An old person likes to be surrounded by their family members. In my country the most important thing in each family is the grandparents or an old father they should get the full care by their children and stay at their children's house. And when the old person sees that he is that important he will be self satisfied that he raised good children. And every old person likes it when he plays with his grandchild and so on.
