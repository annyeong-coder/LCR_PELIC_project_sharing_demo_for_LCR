When I came here I've decided several things. First I wanted to study English hard. It is main reason why I came here. Second I wanted to read the whole bible. When I was in Korea I couldn't read the bible because of busy. So I thought I would able to read the bible in Pittsburgh. Third I wanted to do many activities. I thought doing activities would be useful for improving English and learning American cultures and making a lot of friend who came from other countries. And last I wanted to work out for losing my weight. Now I've been studying English hard. And I've been doing activities in almost every week. So I've already made many friends. But I have not read a whole bible yet and I have not worked out every day because I didn't have enough time I've been busier than I thought.
