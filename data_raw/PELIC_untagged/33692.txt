My best friend is Sohyun who graduated from the same high school with me. She is a nurse and likes her job which helps many patients. We like to do lots of things together like watching movies and having delicious food. I really love to talk the story that I have experienced in this country to her. From time to time I really miss her who has a number of same memories with me. I prefer having conversations with her through the Skype which is a service to call to a foreign country for free. One of my hopes is that she travels to the US to see me however it's not easy to do because of a expensive flight ticket. I want to make friends who have lots of things in common with me in this country.
