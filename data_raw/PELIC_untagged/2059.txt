My strengh of a writing in english is that I try to use other expressions when some certain word repeats over and over again in the writing. I know it's not good to overuse one word much as it makes readers feel bored. But I don't know many vocabularies as many as I want to use diverse ones. Also sometimes some meanings are misleaded and it was reverse to what I mean. These two things mean my weaknesses of a writing in English.
