We have to bring matches with us. This is because we can start a fire with matches. Once we have a fire we are capable of cooking food. We also need to bring a flashlight with us. In a desert island there is no electricity so a flashlight must be really helpful. A flahlight can help us see things at night. We also have to bring a knife. With a knife we can make food creat necessary tools. It might be used as a weapon or to creat weapons when we meet a dagerous animal. Besides these things I think that freash water is indispensable. Every one will need water. We can drink it when we are thirsty or use this water to cook food.
