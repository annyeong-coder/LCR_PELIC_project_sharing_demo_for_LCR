There are many different kinds of people in the world. For example some people are smart some people are not. However should people need to get high education in order to give advices In my opinion that is not necessary because of experiences and good organization is more important. First when you need to have an advice who will you talk with My first choose will be my father. The reason is he has many experiences that I do not have. For example when I feel frustrated he always has many stories to encourage me because he has met many different kinds of people in his life. Also he has seen many situations and has already known the solution. Therefore he can help me when I have problems. He does not have a PHD degree. However he can use his experiences to help me and gives me some advices. Some people who have high education sometime do not really have such experiences which mean that he she can not help you at all. Having a good organization is also an important thing that can give advices to people who need. For instance people usually have problems which they do not realize the reason. If someone has a good organization he she can help you to find the reason easily. Then give you an advice to solute. As a result it has been said that a person does not need a good education in order to give good advice. Having more experiences and good organization can help people who need an advice.
