It was my high school graduation. The person who wear blue dress and held a bunch of flower was me. The flower which I held was made by my aunt. My parent also attend it. My father is the person who wore whit shirt and stood next to me and the person who stood at my right side is my mother. I was so sad because I don't want to leave my friends and my school. I love my high school where I study six years. I hope I can have some time to go back to visit my teachers.
