Topic Look before you leap I used to work in a hospital as a nurse before I came here. Sometimes I was very busy to work. I had to work hard and didn't eat lunch because I couldn't have enough time during my work. So I have to do my work so fast and do accurately at that time. I used to work meticulously and check error several times before finished my work. And then I prepared to the change over to next turn co worker. One day I was very busy to work. Most of my patients were getting worse in condition. So I had to do lots of procedures very quickly. At that time I tried to be calm and be cool. But I couldn't recheck patient's IV linger solution. So I gave wrong solution to a patient. I was surprised. As soon as possible I tried to stop the linger solution. And then I notified to a Doctor. Fortunately That solution didn't make bad for him. But I had to keep observation to him after my shift. That situation gave me a lesson. Working in hospital require to attention be calm and be accurate. After that situation I learned to 'Look before you leap' and 'slow and steady wins the race. I used to check and check for my work after that.
