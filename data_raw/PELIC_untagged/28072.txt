I would like to talk about my philosophy classes at Duquesne University. That we want to learn many details about Aristote's philosophy is obvious. Some students want to ask many things that are irrelevant but usually my professor conducts the discussion. Whether or not the questions are interesting my professor develops an outstanding class which always is extraordinary for me. What we should learn to ask is really necessary because the most important virtue of philosophers is to ask appropriate questions. I remember a funny story that happens in my classroom. Somebody that wants to know the meaning of ousia the Greek word was talking for a long time about the wrong meaning of this word. What we all realized is that this person is very pretentious. This was very comical because after this long speech the professor only said a single word. What this is referring to is that when we talk a lot in many cases we say many stupid things. That I learn something important is clear furthermore I think that the most valuable virtue of a philosopher is not to talk a lot.
