Have you ever tried to learn a new language It is difficult for me to learn something novel especially English as a second language. I was struggling with it as I came to the USA because I could not speak it well. Learning foreign language is still hard but I would like to suggest you how to study English. There are three good ways invest your time and efforts make friends and go out into the community. First of all you must invest your time and efforts. For improving listening skills you assign your time to watch TV and listen to the radio. In my case those are very useful. When I watched TV at the first time I could not understand what they said. Even that I assigned my time to it. Finally I could realize that my listening skills were made better. And do not spare your effort to find somewhere offer opportunities to learn English. Definitely there are some chances to learn it. I found where I could study it I have still studied there.
