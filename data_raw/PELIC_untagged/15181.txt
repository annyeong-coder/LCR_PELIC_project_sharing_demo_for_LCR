I like this picture because it shows a quiet and comfortable scene. There is a friendly sandy beach at the edge of a beautiful light blue ocean. On the sand there are two chairs side by side. These chairs are on the left hand side. Next to the chairs on the right side is a kind of umbrella. This umbrella is also above the chairs. Finally there is a lovely bright blue sky where you can see the horizon. This picture invite me to pack my luggage and travel to this place. Where I can relax and calm. I want to spend a lot of time there so I can enjoy the silence.
