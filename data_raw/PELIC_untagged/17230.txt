I am a person who likes to do tasks or homework on time which makes me more respectful to time. My friends with whom I was studying in the college told me this is a good character. This part of my personality which I like the least put me in stress. Usually I feel afraid about getting up late in the morning to go to school. This makes me set my cell phone which I use as an alarm several times before going to bed every night. I told my friend whose name is ANON_NAME_0 about that. He told me to have stress is better than missing an appointment. I told my oldest sister who has the same concept about time and she said that is good. I realized that it is a good habit after I had come to the United States where people respect time more than in Saudi Arabia.
