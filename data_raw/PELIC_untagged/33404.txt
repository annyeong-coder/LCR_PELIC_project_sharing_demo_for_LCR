Everyone does not want to be sad. According to the longman dictionary. Sadness is '' feel unhappy because something unpleasant has happened ''. Sadness causes bad emotions and depression. There are a lot of causes for sadness and iam going to talk about the three major causes of sadness. They are loss failure and lack of health. The first cause is loss that reflect many aspects. For example loss of family friend parents and job. If you lost any of these valuable things you might be sorrow. This sorrow will cause some troubles like depression and isolation from society. In this case person should be patient and try to get over of these troubles. I had lost my friend when I was 20 years old. It was a terrible moment but iam fine now because iam trying to forget everything. The second reason of sadness is failure. Each one avoids all types of failure. For example failure of life marriage business. Some people have wisdom and trying to learn from their failure. They consider their failure as a lesson for them to identify their errors and correct them in the future. We can not avoid effect of failure in the beginning like resenting and frustration but we can get over this failure day in and day out . The third reason of sadness and from my perspective it is an important cause of sadness that is lack of health. We understand the value of health and people without health can not live happy and satisfied even if they wealthy. If we were not careful about our health we would suffer from health problems and that is make us unhappy. Because illness for example cancer kidney failure and other psychology sick such as homesick and addictive make person feel sad unpleased and pessimistic . To sum up people should face sadness with a strong patience and learn from these difficult conditions. If they learned from sadness they would feel comfortable optimistic and tolerant .
