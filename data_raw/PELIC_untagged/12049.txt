My home city and Pittsburgh . Gunsan city is hometown. But now I live in Pittsburgh. So I am going to compare Gunsan and Pittsburgh. Similarities of two cities heavy traffic jam the rivers and mountains. Differences of them are size the swimming pool many train location and language. Pittsburgh and Gunsan don't have heavy traffic jams. They are not big cities. Also they have orgernized transportations. Both of them have the river and mountains. The rivers are big but mountains are not high. But I found differences. Gunsan is smaller than Pittsburgh. In Pittsburgh it has a swimming pool like the sand castle. But in Gunsan has a sea. Also Pittsburgh has many trains but Gunsan has few trains. And Gunsan located in South Korea but Pittsburgh located in U. S. A. In Gunsan speaks Korean but in Pittsburgh speaks English. After comparing two cities I have a decision. I like both of them. Also two cities are important to me.
