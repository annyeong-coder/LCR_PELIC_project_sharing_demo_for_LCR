How did you spend your three days' off Some of you might have refreshing holidays. Fortunately we had pretty nice weather in last weekend. However my last weekend made me more tired than weekdays the last weekend was annoying me a lot because I got in three troubles. Firstly I went to the caf wanted to buy many things at this time's shopping so I was so disappointed to know that shops were closed. At the same day I had another problem and it was the biggest one after coming to America. I almost lost my purse during shopping. My wallet had not only cash but also two credit cards a bankcard and my student ID. I realized that I did not have my wallet in my bag so late. In addition I could not exactly remember where I lost it. After realizing the huge trouble I asked venders if they got my purse or not. However they said that they did not have anything so far. I was totally confused. We decided to go back to the restaurant which we ate lunch the place was the last possibility I might find it. I asked the restaurant's staff about my purse and then she brought it to me. I was so released when I looked my wallet. Although I was able to find it this day was too exciting for me. I was so tired mentally. In the end my weekend made me worn out because I had many troubles such as the computer trouble the unexpected happening and losing my wallet.
