If I'd like to go to the desert island I want to bring a knife because it can help me catch the animals. I want to take compass too because it might help in case I lost a way. In addition I will take sun blocks. It should help protect my skin not to be old. I'll also bring sun powered computer because it could help me connect my family or friends in other places.
