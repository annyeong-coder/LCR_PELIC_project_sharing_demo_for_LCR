This picture is my friends and I in Chicago. We eat Chinese food in chinatown. The man who wore blue clothing also came from Tiawan and another man who came from China wore jacket. The girl who sit beside my seat is my best friend. I remember that it was very cool on that day. Therefore after final exam we went to downtown before we had dinner. After we had dinner the man who brought me to home is my Taiwanese friend.
