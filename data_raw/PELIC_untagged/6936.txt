When I was in korea I was supposed to call my friend back. Because she called me first and I didn't pick up the phone at that time. When I called her back it said that I've got the wrong number. So I pushed the number again. But it said the same thing again. I couldn't figure out what was going on. I had to hang up to phone twice. So I gave up calling her back. Nextday when I met her I had to say sorry to her. But she just kept on laughing at me. She said that her older brother wanted to tease me. He came up with idea that he pretends that I push the wrong number. I could't find out what she was saying. But when I thought over that voice from yesterday's phone call I laughed too. So it just turned out to be a funny story.
