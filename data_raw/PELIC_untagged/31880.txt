I wouldn't consider taking this class to have a monastic life for a whole month. The most difficult problem is living without a computer and internet. First I am an international student I can't bear it if I out of touch with my families and relevant friends for a month. It is acceptable to contact my families roughly once a week if I was very busy. But if I don't call or email them for a month they most likely think I am in danger. Secondly as far as we know computer and internet benefit our life in a lot of ways. Why do we refuse to use them For example when I search a vocabulary I can absorb more knowledge from internet than regular dictionary. Cause I can find more illustrations and model sentences conveniently. Thirdly I really need to make myself relax by using a computer. Such as listening music playing virtual game scanning website etc. To sum up I can't imagine the life without any electronic devices for a long time so I can't register the class which requires students to give up them.
