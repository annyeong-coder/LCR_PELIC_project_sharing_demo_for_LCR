When I was 15 I used to have breakfast every morning. I used to eat bread butter honey. I never used to skip egg. Every sunday I used to go park and used to play children who were younger than me. Now I never have breakfast in the morning. I am not buying bread butter and honey. And I even don't think about egg.
