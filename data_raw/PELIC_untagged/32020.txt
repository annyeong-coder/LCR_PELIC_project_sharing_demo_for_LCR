On February 15 2012 I created a time capsule. I buried it under the biggest building Cathedral at university of Pittsburgh. The capsule contains five items. All items tell sad stories of my valentine. For instance I put a rose and a letter. These indicate the typical items of the valentine however I could not give them to my favor person because Japanese guys are generally shy. The others are a chocolate a candy and a piece of cake. On the valentine's day in Japan women basically give men some sweets. I could not get any sweets from women so I bought and made them by myself. I would appear I was popular to my friends during valentine. It is cheating and ridiculous actions. In conclusion I sealed disgraceful things and my emotions in the capsule. I hope any people will not dig up my capsule.
