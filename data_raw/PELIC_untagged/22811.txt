When I was in high school I used to eat breakfast. But now I just drink a coffee. I used to have long hair but now I have short hair. I used to call my friends every day but now I call them once a month. I used to watch TV with my sisters but now I watch TV with my husband. I used to see my family every day but now I do not. I didn't use to cook to my family but now I used to cook to my husband and daughter.
