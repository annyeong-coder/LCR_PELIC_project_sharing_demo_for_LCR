ANON URLSITE' I can some cartoon for children on there. It's very helpful for me. I mean I need to grew up like children. My point is. . I think learning language has no short cut to be native speaker because I'm also native speaker in Korea. But I didn't study about grammar reading writing first than speaking and listening while I grew up. So I should be like a children here and I'm doing. Honestly I don't want to register for any University here so I don't want to any score from some tests like TOEIC or TOEFL etc. . That is things I can do in my country too! But I can't have a time to meet native speaker at there less than my hometown.
