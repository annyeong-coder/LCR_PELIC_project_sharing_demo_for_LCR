Although I take information from a book and put it in my own word I can't avoid plagiarism. Becasue anyone who reproduces copyrighted material improperly can be prosecuted in a court of la it does not matter if the form or content of the original has been altered as long as any material can be shown to be substantially similar to the original it may be considered a violation of the Copyright Act.
