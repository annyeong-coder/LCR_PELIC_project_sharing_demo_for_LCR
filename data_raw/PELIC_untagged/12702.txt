I knew a friend recently whose name is Moiiie. She is a native speaker who tries to help me improving my English and that really helps a lot. She took me to a restaurant last week which I like the food there very much. The food which I ordered is scrambled eggs mixed with mushrooms and chese. She taught me how to improve my English during the meal. The way to improve my English is to read more listen more and speak more. There are no shortcuts in learing English which we need to do is study hard. That is what she taught me. She will go back to her home town where is Albama. I am really sad about that.
