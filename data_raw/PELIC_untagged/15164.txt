Hi I am ANON_NAME_0 Last Name and I come from China. I've been living Pittsburgh since 2005. I've been studying English in ELI. This is my personal website. It was built in 2005 too. I want to record my experience and meet new friends here. Because I was a businessman in China I have traveled a lot of places. I love travel. For example I have been to Beijing Shanghai and Xi'an in China. And I have been to Washington D. C. Miami Key West and Niagara Fall City in U. S. I really hope to travel with you. We can have fun from travel. Second I am a good fisher. One time I got a 15lb catfish in Moraine State Park last year. I often go fishing especially in summer I do it every week. I almost have known every good place for fishing. I enjoy this activity. Finally I uploaded a lot of pictures of me. You can find the link at the bottom of this page. If your hobbies are as same as mine you can contact me by e mail. We will be good friends.
