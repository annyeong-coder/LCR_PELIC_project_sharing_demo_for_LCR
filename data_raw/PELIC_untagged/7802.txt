Since I was 10 my parents got me to read books as many as possible so I've been reading books and I like to read novels. Also I like to cook and I've cooked Italian food but it was not so good so I don't cook Italian food anymore. When I was 5 my mother sent me to a piano class and I played the piano. I didn't like to play the piano at that time but now I want to learn again. In addition I have watched movies but I haven't watched a movie alone. Moreover I've been taking pictures but I've never thought about dreaming a photogragher. Once I wrote poems when I was in highschool and it was so difficult.
