Eid Aldha is special holiday for the Muslim people . At the end of the Muslim calendar some of Muslim people go to the Maka to perform the Hajj some of them stay at home to make the holiday . I like the Eid more than any holiday because first I meet all my family second there is many events thirdly I help the poor people. First in the holiday morning after I pray I go to my grandfather's house . I meet all my family there and we start the holiday by drink coffee . Usually talk about the history of the holiday and my grandfather tell us how was the holiday in the past . After that around 7 am we start the interesting part of the holiday . The second reason of why I like the Eid is the event that occur in holiday morning .
