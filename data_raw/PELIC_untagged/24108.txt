In my opinion I think the use of emoticons is becoming a mania especially with teenagers. We can notice that clearly in chatting websites and some forums. In the listening passage the speaker illustrated how the emoticons become widely used between a girl and a boy in arranging their date. Therefore emoticons have changed the way teenagers communicate and make the bulk of their communication by using special signs and symbols.
