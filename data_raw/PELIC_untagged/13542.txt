I think I'm an introvert person who likes spending time alone. I like watching TV reading books and surfing Internet in my room. In addition I like swimming because I don't need to speak anything naturally while I'm swimming. I'm reluctant to go to somewhere with a large grup. It makes me tired. But of course I like to talk with friends who know me well. I tend to focus on one thing that I choose no reason. When I lived in Japan I focused on swimming. I'd swum at least 3 km per day. And now I've focused on football which is the most popular sport in the U. S. There is plenty of information of football therefore I need to buy more alone time.
