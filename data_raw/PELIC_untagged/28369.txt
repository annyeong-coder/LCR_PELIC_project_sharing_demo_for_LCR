Change' is one of important themes in the two essays. Also it has more meaning than just surface change in both stories. In The primitive tongue of a lesser species the main character was a drug addict and alcoholic for many years and could barely take care of himself. He thought he isn't eligible for having kids or family. However after becoming sober he had a family like relationship with Pam's family. It was a big change for him because he could be happy when he spent time with the children and the dog. He could experience lots of things that he had not imagined before. Also he could realize the worth of family and present and could review his life by the change. In the Grandpa's Vessel the grandfather's personality had changed due to the Alzheimer's. Although this illness is regarded as a terrible and intolerable illness the grandfather had changed toward good way. Sometimes he exhibited some weird behavior or imagination but he became more friendly and amicable. He started to laugh aloud or talk a lot with the family. This change affected not only himself but other family members and even livestock. He started to think that he doesn't deserve the livestock despite the fact that he slapped them mercilessly in the past. Also his grandson the narrator of the story felt he could be closer to the grandfatger.
