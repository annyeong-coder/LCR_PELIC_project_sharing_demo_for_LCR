Melissa is a really elegant lady. She is fascinated with fashion specially shoes. When you open her closet you will find different types of shoes. Her shoes are ranged from high heels to sneakers and cheap to expensive. Actually she does not care about being comfortable while wearing her them. Thus she always faces problems. For example she slips or trip while walking or step on the others' feet in buses. She used to do crazy things like screaming and shouting. One day our third friend invited us to her house. I picked her but we had a flat tire. We decided to walk all the way. Suddenly one of her high heels broke and I told her if you fall down in the middle of the side walk you should stand up quickly and complete walking with a big smile on your face .
