I did an activity with the prepositions and how to use them properly in a sentence. I found it really helpful because not only they gave me exercises but also they gave me explanations of each preposition when to use them and what does they mean. Now it will be easy for me to incorporate them in any essay in the future without having the fear of making a grammatical mistake. Learning an activity that will help me improve my English in all its part not just the writing part is a great feeling that I think most of the students wants to achieve. Moreover students should take advantage of the technology nowadays because sites like Google and other surf engines really helped us learn more and get extra explanations about things we didn't know.
