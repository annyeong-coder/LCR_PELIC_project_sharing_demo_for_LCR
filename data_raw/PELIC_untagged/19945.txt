Last weekend my wife and I went to Niagara Falls NY. It was such a gorgeous place. We spent two days there. My wife who is very fond of rivers and lakes in general got fascinated by this huge amount of water flood. Although we did not do any of the activities such as maid of the mist or cave of the winds and our consolation is in the hope of another visit. We had great fun seeing the waterfalls and wandering in those green areas with different colours of trees leaves. We also had a wonderful barbeque. Unfortunately the Canadian side of Niagara Falls was not accessible for us otherwise we would have had a different vision of the scene. If fact Niagara Falls is worth visiting and we agreed on paying another visit to it in the future but in the summer time. This visit enhanced our trust of the American tourism and generated a great feeling to explore other ambiguous cites in the States. From my point of view Niagara Falls reveals the majesty and creativity of God.
