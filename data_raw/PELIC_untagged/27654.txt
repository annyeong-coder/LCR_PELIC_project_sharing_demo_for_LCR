I have some plans to build my English skill up. First of all I will set my grammar up because English counts on grammar. Secifically If I figure grammar's rules out I can write and speak well. In my case I had received a grade D in a English class and I gave up studying English. Nevertheless I have been to the U. S. So I cleaned my brain up and started English over. I found grammar out and it is the most basical part of English. Second I won't put me off and I will cheer me up after a exam. Because of carrying on a confidence. In my opinion the confidence is very important when we learning English. If a student who is learning English has no confidence he she may not speak loudly and take English in. So I will make skills up and practice again and again.
