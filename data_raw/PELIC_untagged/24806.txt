In the lecture Power and Freedom Whole Soyinka Nigerian Nobel prize of Literature starts talking about the difficulties of relationships between citizens in societies where daily life is controlled by fear. He explains that liberation movements may be forced to seek help from dangerous quarters. The author adds that these days there are not just countries that control and direct the lives of their citizens. When the rule of law breaks down shadowy forces set themselves up as quasi states and these more than anything else have produced today's climate of fear . Soyinka notes that anyone who has lived in totalitarian regimes knows what a 'climate of fear' is. But he also has a global perspective. He say that in countries as US Nigeria Israel among others people is less conscious about the climate of fear but that doesn't mean that fear is not used to achieve goals of particular groups. According to the author a quasi states is a group of individuals it could be official a hidden actor inside the government or independent for whom is convenient the idea that the nation has a big enemy gorilla terrorist or any particular group . After diffuse this idea this quasi states can justify the control of people's lifes based on fear. The worst part he says is that thanks to propaganda people agree with the climate of fear and diffuse the idea. Soyinka's lecture is a reminder of who in the end suffers most. Soyinka explains how he was perhaps one of the last million or two of the world population to know that the world had allegedly undergone a permanent transformation in September 2001 . Soyinka covers a large amount of ground in engaging fashion. The arguments remain ultimately fairly general but specifically for any audience that has generally focussed only on examining aspects of these issues from a limited national perspective.
