I saw a movie named The Cradle of Life last weekend. Here is the story of this movie which is related to the Pandora's Box. Following the earthquake that happens in the Santorin Greece great deals of treasure are found in the seabed which includes an orb that is found in the Luna temple. However the orb which is supposed to be the map for the Pandora's Box is grabbed by John Reiss who is the most famous biological weapon designer and the Nobel Prize gainer for some evil motives. Lara Croft and Terry of course a beautiful woman and a handsome man present and fight for saving the world. After some incredible things righteousness wins over unrighteousness finally. Unfortunately the movie featuring Angelina Jolie is not as good as I conceived firstly. The reasons that I do not like this movie are two. First the person who writes the movie scenarios must be short of general basal knowledge which should be considered at the first place. Some backgrounds presented in the movie are really ridiculous. Second there are too many ambivalent plots in the movie. Lara who is the leading actor of the movie would become strong or weak smart or stupid only depend on the need of the screenwriter. In conclusion I think this movie just proves an old saying that a wretched sequel to a fine work.
