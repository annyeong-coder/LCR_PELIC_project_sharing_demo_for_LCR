1 I should not have come to the US then I could have started my academic study directly. 2 I should have taken the TOEFL then I could have applied to graduate school. 3 I should not lived in south Oakland then I could have a better house. 4 I should have bought a car last year then I could have visited many places. 5 I should have studied English in another university then I have gotten an academic acceptance.
