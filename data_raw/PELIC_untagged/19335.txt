When I was doing my internship in a private company in my country where is Turkey I met her. She was cute nice and outgoing. She was there because of same reason with me. At the starting I didn't like her. After I started to know her in short time I liked her. She had been trying to help me during we were together. Even though She was one year older than me She had not made it problem. Couple years later When I was in the military service we divorced. I hope you like this one too I am not sure this should be real or not. I am not understanding what are you anticipating about me. I'm trying to do what I understood. . . Bests
