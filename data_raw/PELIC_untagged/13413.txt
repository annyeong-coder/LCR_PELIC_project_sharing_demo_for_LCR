When I was a child I used to like chocolate. I didn't like sweet things. I used to have a short hair. I didn't like that but I had to do that because it is my school rule. I never used to eat vegetables. I used to play the violin. But now days I like sweet things especially coffee. I live in Pittsburgh by myself. I can't play the violin because I just forget it.
