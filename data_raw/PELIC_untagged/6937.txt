A lot of people work for many differnt reasons. Some people work because they need money to live. Others work because they want to enjoy what they are doing at their work. There are many other reasons that people work. However As I am Concerned people work for developing their social skills and enjoying thier lives. First people deal with other people at thier work. They have to deal with their client consumer and boss at work. People faces with many differnt situations too. It brings people to develop their social skills. For an example my cousin ANON_NAME_0 she used to be very shy person. When she started to work at car dealer agency she turned out to be very outgoing person. Consdering this reason There is no doubt that people work for enhancing their social skills. Second reason that people work is that they can enjoy their lives through their job. Not many people want to do nothing.
