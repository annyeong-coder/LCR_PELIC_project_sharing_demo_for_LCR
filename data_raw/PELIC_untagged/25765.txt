Monica told friends that she would not prepare turkey to thanksgiving dinner since half of them cannot eat turkey this year. However Joey complained about it and insisted that he can eat whole turkey by himself. After negotiating Monica decided to cook turkey. Monica also invited Will who is a friend of them when they were in high school to the thanksgiving dinner. When he came to Monica's apartment he looked gorgeous because he had lost weights a lot. However Will was really hostile to Rachel and he reminded Ross that they made 'I hate Rachel Club' when they were in high school. Also the fact that they made malicious rumors about her was revealed. Rachel shocked about that and she also disclosed the secret of Ross. While their conflict became severe Joey still tried to eat whole turkey. Since his jeans were too tight he changed for Rachel's maternity pants to eat more turkey. Finally Joey ate most of the turkey also Ross and Rachel could be reconciled because Monica made them realize that they have a baby together.
