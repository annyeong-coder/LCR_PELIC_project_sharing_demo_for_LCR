It was 2 o'clock on the morning when I arrived to the airport of Pittsburgh. After a long trip of flying my family and I were so tired. And we had many bags. I tried to get a carrier to use but I needed some coins to have one. Wherever I went no body was able to help me to have a change. When I decided to take a taxi I asked an old man about the best way to go to the downtown of Pittsburgh. The old man told me that I could got a yellow cap if I pass the port to go out side. His answer was strange for me. Why I had to buy a yellow cap to go to the city center I asked myself. When I got a taxi I understood what he meant by yellow cap. My thinking was funny. This is not the end of my story because all the taxi drivers who I talked to refused to give me a ride unless I brought two children car seats for my two kids. Had I to carry them with me from my country When I remember that I laugh.
