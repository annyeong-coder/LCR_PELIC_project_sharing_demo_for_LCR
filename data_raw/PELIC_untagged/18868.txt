2. Heavy traffic is a big problem in both cities and suburbs. What can we do about it Today it is true that heavy traffic is a big problem in both ciries and suburbs. First of all I think that people need to reduce amount of using their own car and have to increase the time of using public transport. For this goverment should encourge the people to reduce using the own car by telling the problems. Also goverment should offer good survice in trans port to people in oreder to try to increase the using amount of public transport. And I think using some system which goverment just allow few people to use their own car in some day is good idea to decrease the heavy traffic.
