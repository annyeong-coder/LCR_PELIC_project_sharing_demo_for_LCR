A good study that is a good plan before beginning of study. The intelligent students organize their time and they choose the best of times to study and they prepare themselves before coming to thier classes. A lot of students have a couple of ideas to study for an exam. First of all It is better to read the topic before the class. Second you can discuss your teacher about some difficult points. Then try to write as much notes as you can during the lecture. Afterthat I'd like to advise you to study day by day. Moreover you can cooperate with your classmate to remember some points. Finally review all of your topics before the exam and try to sleep early.
