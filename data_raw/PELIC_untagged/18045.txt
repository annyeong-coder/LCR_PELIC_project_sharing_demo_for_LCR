There are three main reasons why I want to get married. The causes are my religion my love for her strongly and my desire for children. Because I am Moslem I have to get married before I become forty years old I was thirty when I married unless I do not have enough money or if I was not able to get married. For example if I have a stable disability which prevents me to get married that is Ok to stay single. Also I had strong love story with the girl who I wanted her to be my wife. I was seeing her every day. For example if I did not see her in one day I talked with her by phone or make chatting via internet. I was not able to stay alive without her. In addition I have a desire for two children. With children the life becomes sweeter than before. For example my best friend got marry four years ago but he has no children yet. So he is not happy in his life. Because at these reasons I married the girl who I love. Now I have a newborn she is a girl. I am very happy because I became a father.
