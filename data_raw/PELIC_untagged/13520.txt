There are many differences between cultures you may find these differences in many aspects for example Eating habits Education and Religion. I will talk about my country Saudi Arabia and America. First in my country we like to eat rice and pasta but in America they like to eat hamburger pizza. Second the education in my county is FREE. I mean you don't have to pay fees for the university also the books are free and if you are living 70 Km far away from the university you will get a free room in the campus and you can use the computer and the internet to be honest it is low speed anywhere in the university and you will get a stipend every month it's about 270 and if your final semester's grade is 3 or above out of 4 you will get award. But in US you have to pay fees and for apartment and you can use the internet high speed anywhere and recently we have a few private universities about 2 or 3 only and of course they follow as same rules and method as in US. In my country male and female in universities are separated I mean every university has two branches one for men and the other for women but Third the economy
