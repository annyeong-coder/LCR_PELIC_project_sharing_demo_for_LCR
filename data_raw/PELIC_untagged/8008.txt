I had some hobbies when I was a child. I have collected lots of dolls since my uncle bought me one when I was 8 years old. In addition I have been playing the piano since I started studying in elementary school. Also I have listened to classical music for a long time. I played the badminton when I studied in junior high school. Besides I raised a bird when I was 12 years old. Moreover I began playing chess when I joined the activity in the fifth grade.
