I wanted to re decorate my room. So I rearranged my room yesterday. First I straightened up the paintig on the wall and touched it up. Next I hung up the mirror and covered up the hole. Then I bought a bed and turned it around. After that I turned on the TV and turned off the light. Also I took down the certain and let sunshine in. Finally I threw out the trash and put my laundry away.
