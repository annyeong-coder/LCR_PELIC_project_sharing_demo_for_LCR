When I came to the U. S. A 5 months ago my brother in law and I were invited by Indians. We got their home I was shocked because there were 30 people in there and also there were ten different types of foods on the table such as rice chicken beef. Before I went there I had never tasted Indian foods. I got a piece of chicken some salad and a few fruit. I got chicken but I didn t realize that this was a chicken because Indians eat all foods with a lot of peper and spice. I was eating something but I didn t know what I was eating. I asked my brother in law what was it he said chicken. After this meal I didn t eat Indian foods.
