When I was a child I always dreamed to become a medical doctor. As soon as I finished high school I started to get information about this field from medical students. However they tried to convince me to study this major although the places for studying were limited. When I signed up for studying medicine I felt so happy to realize my dream. After I got accepted from the university I decided to do volunteering at the Red Cross in my hometown. When I went there for the first time I met a guy who was also studying medicine. Whenever we met each other at the Red Cross we were talking about medicine. While we were volunteering we met each other 3 times a week and suddenly we fell in love with each other. Till 13 years we have been a couple and since 2 years we have been married. While he became a very good transplant surgent I gave up with my major and began a career in banking. Nevertheless I am happy with my decision and I still believe one doctor in a family is without doubt enough.
