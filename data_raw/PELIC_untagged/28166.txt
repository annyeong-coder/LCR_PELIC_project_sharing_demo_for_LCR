Have you ever heard about one of the quotations Very few people can congratulate without envy a friend who has succeeded I think when you have in trouble people usually want to help you because most people have some sympathies. On the other hands if you have succeeded or you have gotten much money most people might envy you even though your friends can be jealous of your success or wealth. Fortunately I have a best friend who can congratulate me on my success. Arim is my best friend whom I met in church in 2002. When I met her at the first time she looks sensitive and unfriendly. However I realized I completely misunderstood her personalities. She is very friendly and nice. Also she is the person that has taken care of people who needs help. For example when I got a job in my country 4 years ago Arim was really happy and she truly congratulated me on getting job like her own business. I was so impressed at that time. As a result our friendship is keeping up until now and she is still my best friend ever.
