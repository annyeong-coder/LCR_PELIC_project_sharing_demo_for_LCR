Japan has plenty of significant places and buildings. And then I fascinated The Thuruga Zyou Castle when I was middle school. However I'm not sure whether other Japanese emphasize it or not because it's not very famous spot. The Thuruga Zyou Castle was established in 1384 in Fukushima prefecture and it finished its role in 1868. The Castle's looking is magnificent but I like its behind story. That story has been intriguing many people. Japan had a war between the old government and the new government in 1868. The old government had conservative policy that kept going nothing change in contrast the new government was trying to reform Japan. All of Japan's areas involved that violent war. The Thuruga Zyou Castle was a final base of the old government. When the end of the war people who belong to the old government swore loyalty to it and they held in the castle for a month. Finally a general of it laid dawn the war. Before he announced loss lots of people died by themselves with honor in the castle included woman and children. After this war Japan changed everything such as cultures economy and so far. I think that this tragic story represents typical Japanese spirit. And The Thuruga Zyou Castle is the start point of renewaled Japan. Therefore I think that this castle is a significant building.
