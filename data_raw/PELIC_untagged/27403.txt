My country which is Saudi Arabia is located in the Middle East. My country is surrounded by two beaches which are red sea and the Arabian golf beach and nine countries which are Syria Jordan Iraq Kuwait Bahrain Qatar the United Arab Emirates Oman and Yemen. The weather in Saudi Arabia is very hot and in some cities is humid. Our culture is kindly different from the United States but it is easy to adapt with other cultures. The most meal people enjoy to eat is rice with chicken or meat. They eat it every day in their lunch. Also the structure of building in Saudi Arabia is not as like as in the United States. In Saudi Arabia people use concrete to build their houses and they never use wood.
