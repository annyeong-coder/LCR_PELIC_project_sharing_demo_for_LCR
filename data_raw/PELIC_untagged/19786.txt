I think Internet is a good place to meet a romantic partner for some people. Online dating sites are one of the resource to meet eligible people these days. It would be useful if you know some rules and use it carefully. Although I don't recommend teens and people who are not familiar with Internet world because they are obviously easy to fail to dangerous side of the Internet. I have a good example. One of my friends who is a very busy doctor met a partner who is an architect at ANON URLSITE. They have the same hobby martial arts it helped them to know each other well. They got married 3 years later. I also know some not good examples. I read news about many teens have been victimised climes since online dating triggered them. The same as teens people who are lately joined Internet world also easy to fail to the bad side of the Internet because it is virtual world so that person can easy to pretend to some other person. The people take time to get use to the virtual world. So it isn't a good place to meet a romantic partner for people who don't get use to the Internet virtual world.
