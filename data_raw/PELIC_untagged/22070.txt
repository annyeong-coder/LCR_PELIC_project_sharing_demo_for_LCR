I think human and nonhuman language is totally different. First our human can creat our own word and language but nonhuman just have imitative language. Second human hav much vocabulary and also we can use these words to make conversation. But nonhuman sometimes just have simple words and they can not have conversations. Most of time they may just use body language to communicate.
