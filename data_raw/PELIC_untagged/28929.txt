Asked to get a master's degree I need to take TOEFL and GRE exam. Wanting to improve my English skill I came to the ELI from which I learned a lot. This is my second term here and I will continue my study before accepted by a university. After taking the final exams I will travel to Puerto Rico which attracts thousands of visitors every year. Having many historic sites the Old San ANON_NAME_0 area is worth to be visited. Upon coming back I will take the GRE exam. I will begin to apply universities if I can get a good score. Only if I can not be accepted by a university will I stay at the ELI. I'm very confident that I can achieve my goal. I will go back China after getting a master's degree.
