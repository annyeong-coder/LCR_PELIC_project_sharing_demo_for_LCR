The city of Pittsburgh. When I came to this city I like it very much but with the time I dont like it because the weather is very tough fo me and I can resiste for this kind of weather . In addition it very big and you must to have a car to do your things like shopping visit your friends. But the thing that I like in this city is the people are very nice and very helpfull as a simple example the people in ELI our teachers every one hwo work in the cathedrale. In general I love this city .
