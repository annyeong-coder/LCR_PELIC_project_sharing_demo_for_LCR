In some countries including mine school uniforms are the main requirement for provided or nonprovided primary middle and high schools. Some people like this idea some people say that it is not necessary. In my opinion every kind of school worldwide until university should be all introduced school uniform regulations. The first aspect a school uniform makes it easier for the school authorities to recognize students belonging to their school. And it can instill a sense of discipline and community feeling. Second a school uniform also saves the school administrators from having to police what the students wear. There are no daily battles regarding what's appropriate or not for school. The third main aspect a school uniform apparently also saves students from putting their fashion tastes before their learning requirements. When they don't have to spend time wondering what to wear and how to make a fashion statement they can devote more time to getting an education. In conclusion there are countless benefits of school uniforms implementation. This regulation reduce the social problems the students might have. Before disapproving of this regulation should think deeply for the psychological healthy young people.
