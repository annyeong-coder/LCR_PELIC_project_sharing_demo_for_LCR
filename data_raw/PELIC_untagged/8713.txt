At the beginning of September I had an accident in Philadelphia. Because it was hard to get the air plane ticket I decided to go there by my car. However I thought it was difficult or dangerous to go there by a car. If I had not gone to Philadelphia or if I had chosen plane instead of a car I wouldn't have had the accident there. At that time we were hit by the car behind us. The driver couldn't see the signal and hit us. If he had concentrated on the driving he wouldn't hit us. Some of them in the behind car got injured seriously so two ambulance came to our place. If one of them who was sitting front seat had fastened the seat belt he would have gotten injured a little bit. I wish they would get better soon. I and my friends are still going to hospital too. I wish we will be getting better soon and stop going to the hospital.
