Two years ago I went to Egypt with my husband and my children. That was a trip we take it in the summer. We stayed in Egypt two weeks. The weather was nice. We had a lot of time at the beach. We visited many places. Egypt has a great library I visited it and bought some books. I bought a few cloths for my children. We didn't spend much of money because Egypt cheaper than Libya. I hope I get other trips the same as that trip.
