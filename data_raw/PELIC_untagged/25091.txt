Tudents use the computer to do etting an excuse if they were absent. Moreover students use the computer to communicate with their families to get out of the atmosphere of the study. For instance I constantly talk with my family every Sunday by Skype or MSN. In addition students use the computer to keep in touch with friends by chatting or sending pictures to them. In conclusion the three main reasons for students to use the computer are to find information to utilize it in the school and to communicate with the others. In my opinion students should have a computer to be more successful.
