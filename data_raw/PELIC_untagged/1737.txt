I think my final assignment is bad. First my grammatical structures was not good. I repeated the same mistakes several times. Sometimes I don't know where I made mistakes. I couldn't find error by myself. I think I can't use punctuation well. I confused part of speecah of the word. Second I think I didn't do the evidence well. I should quote someone's words but I didn't. I also need to give more information about nutritional science for proofing my theory. If I put more information my theory will have more persuasiveness.
