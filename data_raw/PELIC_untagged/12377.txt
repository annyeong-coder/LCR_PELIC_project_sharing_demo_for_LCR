On April 15 Tom Higgins opened a new restaurant that is called Undergrad grill at Benson University. He got a good place for his restaurant but unfortunately his restaurant is becoming poor. There are two main reasons that the Undergrad grill is doing poorly. First Tom Higgins cannot afford to keep his restaurant because he wanted to deal with everything fast before he opened his restaurant. Before opening the restaurant he spent money too much in renovating and high rent. To renovate his restaurant he hired some workers and he overpaid his workers at once. Later he cannot afford professional cooks so he cannot help hiring several students to do the cooking. In addition the lack of advertising caused the failure of his business. That is why he did not care about other restaurants because of the good location of his restaurant so he convinced his restaurant would do well without advertising. But no advertising largely affected that his restaurant was becoming poor. Inproper using of money and advertising lead his business to fail.
