When I came to Pittsburgh I realized that I have many chances to try many new things. I like to have a variety of meals. One of my favorite is Mexican's foods. A quesadilla is one of the best for me. It made of cheese and folded wheat. Many restaurants add a piece of grilled chicken into. A circle of quesadilla will be cut to 6 8 small pieces. It likes to serve with a cup of dipping sauce. I prefer to have it with a glass of soda. It should be a wonderful time if I can share them with my friends.
