Nowadays students face the dilemma of choosing whether Grammer or writing class. This problem is the much debated one in that it affects everybody in their daily lives. Students may prefer one to another. Although some may have no opinion about it all. Before rendering my opinion I think it is necessary to take a glance at the argument of both sides. It is quite easy for average people to choose Writing because of the obvious reason that writing many paragraphs will help them to improve their English. For instance a student who registers only in writing usualy able to write essay in a short time. However although writing has some advantages it also has many drawbacks such as grammer mistakes which means student needs to study grammer. Therefore we don't have complete evidence to suggest that Writing is always better than Grammer. What is more if you notice the invisible benefits of studying grammer you can understand how the grammer more deeply. Beside the further reason why I advocate the grammer is that the grammer is the base of language. In addition ELI's teachers who teaches grammer have high efficiency in grammer science such as Peter. Finally if all the factors above are considered we will find out that the advantages of grammer outweigh those of writing.
