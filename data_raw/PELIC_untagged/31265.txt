I was surprised when I saw my brother at home. He was studying abroad for 2 years. He didn't tell us whether he was going to come back at summer vacation or not. Suddenly I saw him in front of me at the kitchen. I was truly shocked and I didn't knew whether my mom saw him or not. He told me that he didn't met her yet. I shouted at him and I wondered how my mom would react if she saw him. I was thinking how we can surprise my mother without frightening her. We began to think of a way to surprise her quietly. After all it was a nice thing to see him with us after tow years without spending hours thinking and waiting for his flight to arrive.
