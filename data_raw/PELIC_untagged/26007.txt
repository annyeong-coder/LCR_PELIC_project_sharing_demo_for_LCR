Dear Mr. ANON_NAME_0 I am a student at the EFL Computer Training Institute. My calsses are very good but the Institute had better make some improvements or many students are going to leave. First I think you should arrange the Institute. Befor you arrange the Institute you should empty the trash. And you ought to repair the printer . Also you should paint the wall. An additional advice you ought to fix broken window. Forthermore there is a computer but it's not enough . You should buy many computers. The students shouldn't drink or eat inside the computer lape so you should put note next to the door perhapite that . Thank you Mr. Thamson.
