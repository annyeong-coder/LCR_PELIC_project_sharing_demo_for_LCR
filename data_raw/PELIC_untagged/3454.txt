Anna I am looking for an apartment where I live during staying at Pittsburgh. Do you know some good place ANON_NAME_0 I'd better ask another friend whose name is Jojo. Most friends who want to find the apartment give a piece of advice to her and I know some who got a nice place! Anna Ok Thank you! But I want you to recommend some good ones you know. ANON_NAME_0 Well It will be good for you if you get the apartment near school. So find some at Oakland but It might be expensive for you. Anna Ok! I'll consider about that. Anyway Aren't you hungry Let's eat something! You should bring me to a nice place! I'm new here as you know. ANON_NAME_0 Which food do you want to eat Anna I don't mind any food. I saw a restaurant which is called 'Lulu's'. Maybe they could serve chinese foods ANON_NAME_0 I think it's closer to Thai food but they also have chinese foods few types of korean or japanese foods. Anna Ok let's go there if you don't mind. ANON_NAME_0 No I dont' mind. But I'm sorry that I can not stay with you long. I have to go somewhere with my sister. Anna It's ok. If you are busy you can go right now. You don't have to have dinner with me. ANON_NAME_0 No. I can have dinner with you. I just let you know I shouldn't be with you longer. Anna That's fine. At least you can have dinner! Let's move quickly.
