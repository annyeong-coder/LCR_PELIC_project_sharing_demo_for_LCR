If I have a great deal of money first of all I'll travel all over Northern Europe by train. I want to see a white night a mountain covered with perpetual snow as much as I can. Needless to say taking picture of every scenery is essential. Secondly I'm going to buy some luxury goods like as Prada's shoes Gucci's clothing. Someone think that It is overconsumtion. However to collect several luxury goods isn't extravagant consumption since I have a lot of money. Lastly I want to see the English Premier League. Probably most korean want to see this soccer match because there are a few korean soccer players in the E. P. L. Since the cost of the ticket is worth almost 100 only the people who have enough money can afford to see the match directly. If I saw the soccer match directly it would be the most awesome match that I have ever seen.
