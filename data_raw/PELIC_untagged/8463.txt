The article claims that synesthesia are ordinary people who see and feel things the rest of us don't and with a rare brain condition. When thinking about having sixth sense ability would be interesting or difficult we have to consider whether this phenomenon could be accepted by a public or not Scientists can prove synethesia exists they still don't know what causes it. Under this non clear circumstance those who have sixth sense ability were considered as an crank or a crackpot. To illustrate X Men is a 2000 superhero film based upon the fictional characters the X Men. The film is about mutants who are the next evolutionary step in the chain of humanity with special powers that manifest at puberty. These mutants are almost universally feared and loathed by the rest of humanity. Although synesthetes don't afraid of being with others they are fear of being ridiculed. They are embarrassed so often they keep their condition to themselves. And this is why I think it is difficult to have this condition. After all ordinary people are regarded it as a strange phenomenon in our society.
