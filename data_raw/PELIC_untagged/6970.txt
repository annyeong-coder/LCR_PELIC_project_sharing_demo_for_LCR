My room is bright and sunny in the morning. When I wake up I sit down my bed. After I sit down I think about what I should do to today. I look to hang a photograph up. A photograph does my room up. Also an art photograph cheers me u. When I get back from school I change clothes and I put casual clothes on. Before I sleep I look at the sky though my room's window. I like my room.
