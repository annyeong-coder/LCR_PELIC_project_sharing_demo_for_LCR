I used to live at Ilsan city in South Korea. I used to work at hospital emergency room. I use to treat and care for patients. One day I determined to do what I study for specialize course in my field. I had to study English in order to attain my objective. So I used to study prepare to transfer. I used to learn English at institute after finish the work. It's really hard and tired. As a result. I used to doze off on my way back. Today I am living in Pittsburgh and studying English at the University of Pittsburgh ELI. When I worked in my country I didn't use to study English but I spend lots time studying these days.
