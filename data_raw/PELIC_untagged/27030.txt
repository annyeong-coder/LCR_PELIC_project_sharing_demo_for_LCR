I've seen the gorgeous old towns and countryside of rural Connecticut and Massachusetts where hundreds of big handsome Mark Twain vintage white wooden homes line both sides of U. S. 5 For miles and miles. I've seen the green mountains and endless thick forests along the beautiful Connecticut River valley as the river runs between Vermont and New Hampshire. I've seen the rough and intimidating White Mountains of New Hampshire and the endless pine oak and maple forests of Maine on U. S. 2 To Bangor. Because the action has completed at some point no time specific.
