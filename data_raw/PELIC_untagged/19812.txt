One of my favorite movies is Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind which was released in 2004 and stared Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet. It was my first movie in that I could watch Jim Carrey's serious act and Kate's diverse color dyed hair. This movie says about one couple's meeting and separating which commonly happen between couples. However this movie uses peculiarly elements of science fiction like erasing lover's memories after separating which discriminates this movie from others. The composition of this movie can be felt to be a little complex which is because a past scene and a present scene are shown disorderly. However this method makes us be concentrated on the movie better. In addition this movie doesn't give us a manipulated result like an unnatural happy ending which we can often see in romantic movie. Lastly we can be aware of that there still exist destiny and an eternal sole mate through this movie.
