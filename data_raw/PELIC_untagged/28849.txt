Some people believe the reason that a number of women scientists are much fewer than its men in the world today is because the situations surrounding women affects them in a negative way so that if we encourage and eliminate these factors women can do as well as men However I think it's not true. Even if men and women pursue their research at the same time women have many more events which relate to women's life directly. For example after getting married people usually expect to quit a job for women and anticipate doing the housework. Granted people have equal rights for men and women this situation often happens in real world. And also when women expect a baby it's inevitable to stop researching for a while. These situations are absolutely diverse from men's situations and that's why I consider most scientists are men.
