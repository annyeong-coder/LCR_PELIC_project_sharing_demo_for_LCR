I have a friend that knows and practices Feng Shui. She suggests me sitting down in my home and thinking about how my environment makes me feel good and bad and what would I like to change it. I tried it out. My home is comfortable. This cheers me up. I need to fix my home up because it is so simple. At night in the living room is very dark but I am going to buy a lamp to light the living room up at night. Also I want to give the closets out well because they are small. I think that these are reform that I would in my home. I will end up feeling happier in my home. It is worth trying out.
