I have graduated from the university with a bachelor's degree in physics for three years. When I remembered that I had chance to change my major in the university I thought I would be an English teacher. That was exactly my dream when I was in the high school. So I worked hard to get a high grades in the English classes because it is one of the requirements to attend English major in the university. However when I wanted to enroll it was too late and there were no more seats. I devastated and I did not want to attend any other majors but my mother insisted to try a Science University. Then I went there and I was immediately accepted in the physics. When the semester started I was crying all the time. My parents felt sympathy about my situation and they had made some kind of connection to change my major but I did not agree because it was too late and it was in the middle of the semester and I did not want to confuse my self and failed in that semester. So I decided to stay and complete what I just started. Now I know a lot of my friends who had the same situation in the past and they successed and made their dreams. I think if I heard my parents I will were an English teacher right now and I will not need any English classes to complete my master in the US.
