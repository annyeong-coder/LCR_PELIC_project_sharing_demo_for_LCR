The international students should be allowed to get work in the country where they are studying in by focus on these points. First of all working might affect their study. Students must pay all of their attention on their purpose. If they get some jobs during studying they will not have enough time to do well on their study. For example basically international students have to study at least five hours a day therefore if they need to work after school that means they will not have time to do any assignments or homework. Second doing two things at the same time is not worth to do. If student are working while they are studying they will not achieve their goal on time. For example it is main problem of international students who get working while they study. Most of them cannot graduate on plan. For instance some of foreign student need to take more classes to build their GPA in order to meet universities policy that asks student to have minimum GPA to graduate their program. Finally the most important is overlapping between immigrant workforce and local workforce. For example international student workers are replaced in the local worker because they do not ask for lower money than local worker. As of this result the business owners prefer low cost of worker. The point is resident workers will not have work to do. It is said that working has many advantages for students. Students can learn the new experience out side the classes. Also they will get familiar to the new culture quickly when they work with native people. However there are a little bit part of the student purpose because they overseas to graduate the programs or enhance their knowledge. In fact in order to getting familiar and earning experience students can join in the group activities or school clubs which universities or schools provide. To sum up there have no reasons that student should get job in the country where they are studying in.
