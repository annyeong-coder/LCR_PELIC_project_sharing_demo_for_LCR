I would like to write about internet and mother. Internet helps me search information. For example if I need job I can find out a job. And I make me be a citizen of internet world. I meet many friends on the internet but internet has not only benefit. Sometimes I spent too much time for web surfing. It had me have a pain on all of my body. My mother got me not to use a computer too much. However she let me use a computer when I study.
