I took my article from Cosmopolitan Magazine and I talks about the stress of the first day at a new job or in a new position. You have to keep in your mind that you are perfect for this job and the people around you like you. To avoid the bad first impression you have to concentrate on your tone way of your listening and eye contact. To be good employees impress your boss by trying hard on your first big stick. Having good relationships depends on you support the ideas of your workmates and remember their own lives. If you see that your boss didn't prepare a neat desk for you it is your time to show him that you can handle fixing all the mess on your desk.
