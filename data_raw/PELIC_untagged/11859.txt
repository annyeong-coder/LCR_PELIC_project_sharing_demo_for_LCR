The most favorite place to eat is ANON_NAME_0 . It's one of the best steak houses in Pittsburgh. They always serve agreeable food also decorating a steak with some vegetables is gorgeous. However food price is very expensive. Accordingly I go there once a month or I go there when I have some events like Valentine Day and a birthday party. I recommend this place for dating because there is something of a lovely atmosphere in this restaurant. I value tastes and atmosphere above anything else when I choose to go to the restaurant. And then I consider food price and location. By all consideration I think ANON_NAME_0 is suitable to eat lunch for me in Pittsburgh.
