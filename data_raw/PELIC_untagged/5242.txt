Graduation is next month ! I need to make some plans now because when exams start I dont have any free time . What am I going to do when I finish school my roommates is going to take a vacation before she look for a job . I cant do that because I will earn some money soon . I think that after I graduated I am going to take a word processing class . As soon as I earn word processing I will look for a job as a bilingual office assistant . Its hard to find full time jobs though. Part time jobs are easier to find. Maybe I'll take a part time job after I find a good full time one. Or maybe I'll take a workshop making decision before I do anything .
