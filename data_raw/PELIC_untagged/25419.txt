Last night I saw a wonderful movie. This movie called Robin Hood has many famous actors such as Russell Crowe. Crowe is the actor to whom I like to watch. The movie's star who has many funny qualities influences people. This movie is directed by Riddey Scott. I like this movie an example of which delivers lessons in our life. He is the director taking place the in top directors list. This movie pictures the problems some of which happened in UK years ago. It is the movie refusing the unjustness in the world. Scott is one of the directors who like to keep whose products in high positions
