This weekend is Chinese New Year. The holiday always cheers Chinese people up. Early three days of the holiday is traditional straightening up home and decorate with paintings flowers letters and lanterns etc. Most people desire to go up a new life in the New Year I also belief it. Last Wednesday in first time I picked out a few paintings and a beautiful lantern in the special store. Nest I touched up walls of my home soon thrown old painting down change to hang new up on the wall. I put a lantern up in my living room the lantern pretty lighted it up. In addition I turned a letter's FU around on my door. The FU means happy come and turning FU down means that many wishes have come. Finally I put a lot of flowers on the each room. I would like to wait Chinese New Year to come.
