Sally ANON_NAME_0 Writing 4Q Feb. 11. 2009 My hometown and Pittsburgh There are two cities for me. One is my hometown Incheon City of South Korea. The other is Pittsburgh that I studying place in the U. S. Have you ever live other country except your country Anybody thinks to like that nowhere lovely like hometown. But I have been feeling different mind a little. First Incheon had an industrial city like Pittsburgh. Therefore it had had serious air pollution and Pittsburgh does too. Second Incheon has the same kinds of weather as Pittsburgh. Because Incheon is locate on seaside that it has strong wind and heavy snow in fall and winter season. Also both Incheon and Pittsburgh have convenient public transportation. Inchoen has a traffic route as Incheon subway that is only running in the local area. On the other hand these two cities also have different points. First of all Incheon has not as long winter season as Pittsburgh. Usually the average winter season in Korea is 3 or 4 months. However Pittsburgh's winter season is longer than Incheon. And Incheon is one of the port town in Korea unlike Pittsburgh. While Pittsburgh have many convenient facillties like library and hospital even though Incheon has also convenient facilities the city mood is not clam like Pittsburgh. Because there are many business quarters. In the end I felt different and similar things between Incheon and Pittsburgh. One thing is clear. They have good points each other according to our position now
