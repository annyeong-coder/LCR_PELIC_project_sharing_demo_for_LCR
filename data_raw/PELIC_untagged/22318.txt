Hello I'm Junyoung. I'm from South Korea and I grew up in In Chon. I have worked in In Chon and I graduated high school from In Chon. And then I moved out to other city for university. Then I've studied for 2 years. After that I joined army and I've been there for 2 years. When I've been in army I learned how to survive in war. I've forgotten anything about army since I finished that. I came back to my university and I enjoyed life of unversity since then. I left Korea 6 month ago because I want to study in United states. I've been living in Pittsburgh since 2009. Also recently I've been studying in ELI. Also I've been suffering from Engllish since I left Korea. However I met many friends teachers in ELI. And they have been providing me good mood to improve skill of English since I've been in ELI.
