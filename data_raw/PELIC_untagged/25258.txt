Mo Writing 3 May 25 2010 My Nephew and me Last year I went with my nephew ANON_NAME_0 to the mall which it has a big games place. I took my nephew to enjoy his time and play well. He was too happy because I surprised him. He wasn't know that I'll take him to play. When we reach the mall he was so exciting for that and he said Uncle Mo I love you. So I was too happy to hear that and too happy to see him happy. After that we started to play with each other on all these games. First we played table soccer. After that we played many different kinds of video games like races fighting and soccer also we played a lot of another games. He was always told me please uncle I want you to play with me. Immediately I told him sure because I want to see his face happy. Finally I missed my nephew so much.
