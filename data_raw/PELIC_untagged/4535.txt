I think Jin hee would be my good room mate in my class. Because as she is a girl we have alot of in common with each other. First she likes shopping like me. We can go to shopping together when we have free time. We can always tell how it looks like when we try on. Secondly She and I do cook so we can share our foods each other. Last She enjoys watching TV at night which is I do too. So we can always watch TV at night. We can do lots of activities together. And I usually take a shower ealier than she does. It won't be any trouble sharing the bathroom. Considering all these reasons Jinh hee would be a great roommate in my class.
