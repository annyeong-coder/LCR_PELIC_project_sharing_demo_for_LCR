My name is xxx but my teachers and my classmates call me Scott because this is my America name. I'm studying English in ELI Pitt. I came to the United States since last July. When I came here at first 2 or 3 months I afraid to talk with American because my English is poor and not good enough to speak English. I have studied 2 semesters in the ELI this is my 3rd semester. Now I don't afraid to talk with American. That means my English is better than before.
