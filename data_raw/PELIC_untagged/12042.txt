Since I came to America I have realized that there are many cultural differences between Korean and American. These differences are base on several cultural factors. First of all American pursue individual life otherwise Korean is more tend to be together. I went to restaurant with American and we got the receipt that we ordered. I thought that we could separate same amount of money for total money. But American started to calculate their own order and tip for each person individually. It looked so complicated and I did not understand at that time. In Korea people go to restaurant and order and share food together. Also when they pay their order they just separate same amount of money each person. In addition to usually order people pay for younger people's order and man pay for women's order. Second Korean tend to do as fast as they can American takes their own time enough. At the airport I waited for getting boarding pass Last
