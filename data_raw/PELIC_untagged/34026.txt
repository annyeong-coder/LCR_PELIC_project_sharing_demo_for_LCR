I'm one of the students at the ELI in Pittsburgh. I recommend that you should decide to choose Pittsburgh where you can live securely more than San Francisco which has some frightening crimes. From my perspective Pittsburgh has many features which attract a lot of people to live in. For example cost of living is much lower in Pittsburgh than any city in the U. S. In addition low taxes is one of the principal features which distinguish this city. When you want to buy some needs such as food or clothes the taxes are cheap. Despite the fact that a climate of Pittsburgh is very hot in the summer it has gorgeous landscapes where you feel comfortable and refreshed when you see. In fact Pittsburgh includes some universities which are considered from the strong universities in the U. S. People who live in this city are so friendly so you can make friendships with them easily. Therefore you can improve your English without difficulty. In short you will get many positive consequences when you choose Pittsburgh.
