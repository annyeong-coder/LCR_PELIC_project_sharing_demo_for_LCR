I received my Medical Doctor license in Japan in 1997. I have had it since then and worked as a pediatrician. I have also been a member of Japanese Pediatrics for 15 years. I have interested in the neonatology for a long time. So I have worked as a neonatologist. Since then I have been a member of Japanese neonatology. On the other side I have interested in the pharmacology. Therefore I studied Pharmacology at graduate school from 1999 to 2004. And I have had Doctor' degree since 2004. While I studied graduate school for studying pharmacology from 1999 to 2004 I kept on doing my job.
