I can't forget the garden behind our old house where I had many childhood memories. We had two active dogs that I always played with them there. In the garden there were several kinds of beautiful flowers in summers when I played water with my families. Sometimes I and my friends dug holes to bury some seeds or our treasure. One of my friends who lived next to our home afraid of the bugs in the soil always stood away. I learned how to ride bicycle in this garden where my father practiced bicycle with me. Later I rode bicycle to race with my dogs frequently in the afternoon when my mother to dry the wet clothes in the sun. Once my dogs were so excited to bump into the place where my mother put wet clothes on and then all the wet clothes drop down the ground and dirty again. My mother who was so angry stopped me to play with my dogs for one week.
