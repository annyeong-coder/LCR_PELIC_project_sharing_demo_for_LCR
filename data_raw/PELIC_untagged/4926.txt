I want to talk a litlle bit about Nadia Comaneci the first gimnast in the history who had taken just 10. 00 In 1974 Summer Olympics. Her exercise is still considered the perfect one and it is believed that she was the greatest gymnast of 20th century. It is known that no one can say anything different because the proof still exist her exercises could be see at any sport TV chanel that exist in the world. A girl fron Japan told me the other day that she know some important person from Romania and that someone is nadia Comananeci. Her hard work and talent had been proved in the entire world that one can do something special and can be remebered by the young one's that aren't even born when she was the best. In the world and in Romania too she's claimed as the biggest woman in sports in the past century title that was give to her in the 2000 maybe the year is not corect . . I don't remember exactly .
