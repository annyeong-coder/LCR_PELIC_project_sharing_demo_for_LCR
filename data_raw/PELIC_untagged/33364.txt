No I would not because I do not want to live with strangers. Certainly it is safe for senior people to live in Leisureville but this is a public facility not my house like a dorm. It might be carefree for some people such as Latino but for me it is not carefree. I am nurvous and unreluxed because I hate gossips so I will be not fit for it to live permanently. I hope to live with my family or friends who completely understand each other.
