Topic Evaluate college students diet Most college students' diets are not good for them. The foods at college are many kinds but the problem is that most of the foods are too fat. Some of the students are too lazy to cook and they eat at school so they become fat. There are many college students' diets that have problems because the food is unhealthy and the prices are a bit expensive. College has a lot of food but it's unhealthy for students. The foods usually are fast food such as french fries hamburgers salad sushi soup sandwiches and pizza because the students don't want to wait long.

We eat these things everyday and it is very unhealthy for us. For example my friend is a college student. He eats lunch at school almost everyday and he rarely exercises. Six month ago his weight was 140 pounds but now it has changed to 170 pounds. Also the food prices at college are a bit expensive. In my opinion some foods' prices at college are same as that I can buy more foods in the supermarket. Buying food at the supermarket is better than eating at school because the food is cheaper at the supermarket that we can save more money. For example I can buy five pieces of bread and meat at the supermarket for the same price as I pay for hamburger in the cafeteria. Many other foods are similar so buying food at the supermarket is a good way to save money. College students' diets have some problems that are bad for them. Sometimes students are busy or have a lot of homework to do so they just eat at school but they still have to think about their health problem. Eating too much fast food will change their body shapes and make them fat. The diet problem is the most important thing that the college students have to consider.
