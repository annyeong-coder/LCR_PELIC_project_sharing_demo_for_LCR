After I finished college I had different choices to decide between either to travel abroad to pursue my higher education in pharmaceutical sciences or to stay in Saudi Arabia and work as a pharmacist. At the end I decided to travel abroad. In fact traveling abroad was not an easy choice because I had to choose between many countries such as the U. S and New Zealand. Were I to work as a pharmacist in Saudi Arabia I would not be living in Pittsburgh right now. If I had stayed in Saudi Arabia I would have gotten married and had a child. Had I known it would be difficult to get an admission to the graduate school I would have stayed home. . If I had gone to New Zealand I would have lived in Christchurch and studied English there. Now after living in Pittsburgh for almost a year I wish I had chosen New Zealand.
