I'm trying to maintain healthy diet. However fried foods are one of the most common foods in the US. Especially I have to eat lunch outside so I enjoy salad or bagel usually but there are not various choices. And since I'm living alone I have to make my meals by myself. However I'm not good at cooking so sometimes I cannot help but add some artificial seasoning which is not good to health.
