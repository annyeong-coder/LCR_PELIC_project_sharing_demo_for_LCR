Drinking Age Should Not Be Lower to Eighteen No doubt that drinking alcohol has bad effects. For this reason some countries do not allow people under twenty one years old to drink or buy alcoholic drinks. Unfortunately some countries allow people who are over eighteen years old to drink and buy alcohol. Actually this issue is complicated because of the argument about when we consider a person to be able to control himself if he drinks alcohol. However I think the age of eighteen is not enough to do all right things in this life. In this age people like adventures and taking risk. As a result I think drinking age should not be lower to eighteen. On one hand I have to say that I can understand why some people see that drinking age should be lowered to eighteen. For example I agree that is eighteen years old are responsible people. On the other hand I think giving people drinking right in this age is an opportunity to have fun in a very dangerous way which could be harmful to them and to their society. To explain more when teenagers reach eighteen they rush toward fun without thinking about consequences because drinking alcohol is the easiest way for them to have fun which makes them drink excessively sometimes. Furthermore they could drive when they are drunk which puts them in dangerous situations. Moreover in my opinion they could get involved in violent behavior when they are drunk more than people who are over twenty one because they still so young to control themselves. In conclusion drinking age should not be lowered to eighteen years old because it is very dangerous and could cause problems to those people and their society.
