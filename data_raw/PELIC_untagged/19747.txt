My fellow citizens We are at a time in our history when we need to make some real sacrifices. Recent presidents have made a great many promises they didn't keep. You may not like everything I tell you tonight but we still have a great deal of work to do so there are several measures I'm proposing. First I want to raise taxes on the very wealthy because few of them are really paying their share. Second many of the members of the middle class are carrying an unfair tax burden so I'm asking for a tax cut for middle class. If I'm successful most of you in the middle class will be paying 10 percent less in taxes next year though a few of you in the higher income group may see your taxes rise a little. How do I intend to make up the lost revenue The problem with the national income tax is that there are many loopholes in the current law which allow some people to avoid paying any taxes at all I want to close these loopholes. My additional plan is to replace the lost revenue with a national sales tax which is fairer because it applies to all people equally. Third we have no money to finance health care reform and we've made little progress in reducing pollution and meeting clean air standards Therefore I am asking for a 50 cent a galllon tax on gasoline which will result in many more people using public transportation and will create additional revenue. Thus we will have enough of money to finance our new health care program and will help the environment at the same time.
