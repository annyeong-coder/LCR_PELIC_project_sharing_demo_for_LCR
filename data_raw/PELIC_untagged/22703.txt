Happiness is one of the most important human emotion and everyone finds happiness in different places. I can be happy easily so I try to be happy every day. Helping others being with pets and enjoy time with family. I am always willing to help people who are in trouble. When I see an old man or woman who wants to cross the street I usually help them do so. I feel happy when each of them thanks me with an amiable smile. Also whenever someone asks me for directions I try my best to help them. But whether my answer is helpful or not they still thank me with a smile. Although I help people only with small matters like these I love people's smiling at me after I help them. I am also happy when I'm with pets because they are not only cute and lovely but also humans' loyal friends. I have lived with my little dog for 5 years. He is my best friend. When I feel frustrated he always sits in front of me and watches me. His loving attention seems to encourage me to smile and let the bad things go. He even licks my tears off my face when I cry. I can be happy as soon as I am with my pet. Ever since I was a little girl I have wanted to be a veterinarian because I can spend time with pet and help them. That's my dream job. I base most of my happiness on my family which includes not only my parents but also relatives. We all loves and cares for each other. When I make mistakes my supportive family never blames me. Instead they always teach me how to avoid future mistakes and encourage me to be happy. I find the greatest happiness in being with my family. Happiness is the most important emotion in my life. I'm fortunately that I have in my life things that make happy people who appreciate my help my loving dog and supportive family.
