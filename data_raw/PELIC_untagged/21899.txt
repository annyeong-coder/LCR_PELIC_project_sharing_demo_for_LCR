My name is Cheickne but people call Cheick and I am from Mali which is in West africa . I've been living here for 8 months and I'm studying english this semester at the language institute at ELI. I have two sisters and four brothers and all of them are married. My name Cheick comes from a famous person in my country but here in America people are calling check however I prefer to be called by Cheick. In my free time I like to listen music play soccer and study. This semester I'm studying hard because I am planning to attend collegue and I am majoring in business. Two of my friends are studying it this year and it seems hard to study business but I am still optimistic about it.
