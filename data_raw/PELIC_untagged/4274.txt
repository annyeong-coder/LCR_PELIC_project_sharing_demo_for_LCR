I always wondered about the great pyramids in Egypt. It remains as one of the seven mysteries in the world. Many scholars and architects tried to explain the secret of them but they failed to do it. Judging from the scale of the great pyramids a great deal of people might have been needed to build them. Also they must have sufferd from the hard work. Based on the fact that the great pyramids were for kings queens or their relatives of ancient Egyption dynasty the great pyramids may have been built to remember their exploit and death. Moreover the scholars and architects who lived in those days must have struggled to develop the technique of building pyramids.
