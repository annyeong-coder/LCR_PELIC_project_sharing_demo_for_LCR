Mokpo in which I was born and grew up was a small city in the southern Korea. I had one brother whom I got along well with and one sister. There are a lot of my friends who fellow high school live in there until now. I had been living in the city for 20 years ago. In this city I had the most impressive memory that my best friend whose sister liked to me. But I couldn't meet her because of the reason why she is a my best friend sister. In conclusion Mokpo where is the most favorite city in my life
