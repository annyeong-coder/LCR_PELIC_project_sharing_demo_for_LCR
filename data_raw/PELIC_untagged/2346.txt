I came to pittsburgh about one month ago. I also have been GOING to the ELI course for one month. I have LEARNED english in my country since I graduated fro m elementary school. I am trying to get used to this city but of course it is not so easy because this is the first time such long time outside my country. However it is difficult to live in another country people are very generous and helpful when you are in trouble. I think I can study for master degree here but I am not sure at the moment. But I hope I am going to decide what to do in a couple of weeks because this is necessary for applying a masters program.
