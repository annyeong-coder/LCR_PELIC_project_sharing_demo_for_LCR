I am writing about my mother who helped me learn to get the ability to take care of myself. She made me do my own chores even if I was too busy to go to bed. She had me clean my room and she got me to study for at least 1hour everyday. At the same time she let me amuse myself with my friends so I could get much interesting experience. Thanks to her I managed to live by myself.
