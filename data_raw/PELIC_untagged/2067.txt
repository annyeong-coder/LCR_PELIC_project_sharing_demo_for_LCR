I have heard about challenge and success in my life. When someone has a challenge he can succeed easily than other people. Success is not a chance result. It is result of one's efforts and challenge is necessary requirement for one's success. At least most people might make a challenge more than one time in their life. In that case how a person successfully met that challenge. When someone meets tense condition he might strive for passing through it and challenge it cleared. For examples my mother was widowed when she was 33 years old. She had four children and didn't have money because her husband was dead by car accident. He didn't prepare anything for his family. If my mother didn t meet the worst case she couldn t succeed for her children. She didn t have time for crying and worrying about future. Her challenge which was earning much money was cleared. My mother worked to support her children and it was her challenge. I never worried about money in my life because my mother supported me completely. I think that my mother was successful to take care of her children. Our sisters and I admire my mother all the time. It is important to have a conviction of success. We don't need to worry about success before doing challenge. We need to have 100 conviction about success. Successful people could insist that all of failures are one of process of success. Successful people have common feature which isn't afraid of failure. Also we must not forget an anecdote about successful people which stimulated us to strive for challenge.
