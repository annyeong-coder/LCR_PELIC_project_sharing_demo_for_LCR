Hi all I have decided to write to you in order to tell you that I have got new job. Before I got it I had been working as baby sitter. I had started looking for a job since I was unemployed. My friend John had been halping to get a job for a long time but it became difficult to find one because I couldn't meet all the job requirements. Then I have decided to apply for this job and the company has accepted me since then. Before I got this job I had been worring how to deal with my chief and collegues but as soon as started working have had good relationship with all of them.
