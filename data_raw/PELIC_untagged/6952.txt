I insist that throwing away somwthing that is still in usable condition is strage behavior. If I get rid of available things I usually sell them at flea market recycle shop or internet auction. I can exhange them to money and it is better that I assign someone who wants my unnecessary thigs because s he might cherish them and I can prevent garbeges from being increased. Moreover If they are available I can donate to charty facilities. When someone cannot afford buing it and I donate them I can contribute social activities. Thus I claim that discording usable things is not efficient for my lifestyle.
