Today my friends think of me as aserious student but they dont know about my stupid phase. Until two years ago ithink mostly about clothes and make up and I usually judged people by apperance possessions. In that period of my life my friend and I spoke in steroetyped phrases. We said hello when some thing seems obvious and what ever when we didn't care about some thing. Inever want any one to realize that I am intrested in school. Sometimes I read the news paper secretly and pretend to be unprepared for tests. One day my older brother came into my room while I was reading a serious novel. No one have ever seen me do that befor eventhough Iam an avid read for years. He thought I pretended to be interested in the book in order to impress a new boy friend. I got angry when laughed at me so I made a decision. I stopped hiding my real interests. Since that day Icarried my news magazines proudly and have expressed my opinions in class. For the last two years I have prepared for tests openly. Now I've applied for college and I am feeling proud of being a good student.
