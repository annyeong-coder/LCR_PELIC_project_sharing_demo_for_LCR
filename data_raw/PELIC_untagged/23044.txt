My room was messy. I used to throw my stuff away when I got into my room. For example I took off my hat and then throw it in bed I put off my shoes anywhere. Also I hanged up lots of posters on the wall. I decided to clean up my room a week ago. Firstly I swept out my room and then threw rubbish away. Secondly I fold up the futon and the clothes. Then I removed my poster at the same time I decorated the wall with oil color. I put my books back to the shelf. It seemed like a new room and it cheered me up.
