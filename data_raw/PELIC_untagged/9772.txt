I have written this page to find new friends who live in different countries. I want to say I have been working alot on my website but I'm almost finished. Then I have written about myself. I grew up in Bursa TURKEY but I have been living in Pittsburgh since 2007. I arrived in Pittsburgh the winter season. The weather was very cold. You don't want to be here in winter. When I came Pittsburgh I didn't know what I do. Then I decided to go to the ELI and I have been studing English for 9 months. I still haven't gotten Toefl. I really like Pittsburgh. I have taken some photos to put in my website. If you interested in my photos please click my website.
