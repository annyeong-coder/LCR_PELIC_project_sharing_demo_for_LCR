I would like to talk about eating habits because I think that every country have a different aspects and different habits. First of all One of the things that I notice here that is very different from the latinamerican food is that the most important meal is dinner. We have a light dinner maybe just milk and cereal the most important meal is the lunch. Another aspects is that in my country we are used to eating healthy food it is different than here because you can fin good prices in restaurant for healthy food . In the USA if you want to eat healthy food it is a little expensive and sometimes the people here prefer to eat fast food because its cheaper but not healthy. When it comes to the similarities because of the large latin population in America we can find a lot of the original latin dishes in restaurants around the united states. We might feel some differences when it comes to the taste but overall its close enough to feel like home. In Conclusion I think eating habits is very important and more in this year a lot of people have overweight and everything is because the fast food is an easy way fast but is not good for our body. I think in this years the people is more conscious about food and they are trying to eat healthy.
