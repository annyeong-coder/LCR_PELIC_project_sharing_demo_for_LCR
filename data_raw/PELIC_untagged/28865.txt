Dear SAND I think you should visit to Minnesota and talk with him. Nobody knows about his feelings until you ask him so you don't have to worry too much about everything. After talking with him you can decide whether to live in Minnesota or not. If he says he want you to move there and you really want it after that you had better think about it. You should consider which one is important for you between your excellent job and him.
