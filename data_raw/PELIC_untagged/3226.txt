I have a friend whose major is athlete in my hometown. We are best friend each other for a long time. He gave up major for his future. We had made a corporation that make a performer before I came the U. S. We have endeavored for people who work for us. Finally We achieved something that have thought a purposes. At that time I thought that want to learn something then I decided that go to the U. S for learning computer science. He still works that we made a company and he is still waiting for that work together with me.
