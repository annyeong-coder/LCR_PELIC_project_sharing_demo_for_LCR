I live with host family who are native speakers in Pittsburgh. They provide me a beautiful room that is beside stairs on second floor. There is a big bed that is in the middle of room. When I wake up every day I can see the trees and flowers outside of my windows which is on right side of my bed. The weather is getting hot so my host mother instals an air condition which is on the bottom of my windows in my room. This room which includes dressing table wardrobe desk makes me comfortable and free.
