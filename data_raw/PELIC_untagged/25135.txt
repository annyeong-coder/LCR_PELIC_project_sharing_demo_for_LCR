My experience is about the day when I got my job. First I graduated my bachlaure degree from AL IMAM UNIVERSITY in cocial work. Secuond I made interview in at AL IMAM UNIVERSITY for teaching assistant . After that I got the job. I was very happy when I got this job however this job is one of my objective to assist me to got my master degree and made butter life. I started teaching in college the same I graduated from . I have loved the teaching since I was little boy specially in university because my cousin work there and I saw his life was good .
