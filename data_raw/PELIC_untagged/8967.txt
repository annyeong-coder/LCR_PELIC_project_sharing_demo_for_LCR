I have a friend who are faithful and loyal. I've kept a firm friendship with him since I met him in an activity club which was created for the people who were interested in film making. We used to go to the movies and shoot short films. We also often used to discuss about films which we saw together at a bar where some people always talked about arts. Sometimes I reminisce the days which I was with him and that cheers me up.
