I love my roommate. She is very nice person. I'm very proud that she is my friend. When I met my friend with her my friends liked her. We met in May 2007. We had been conversation partner. She is studying Korean and I'm studying English. We have known each other for almost a year. She is very religious Christian and I'm becoming Christian. So I have learned bible and Christian mind from her. In addition every time she gave me good recommendations so I could solve my problem very clearly. I don't remember what it was. Anyway it helped me a lot. Our interesting things are very same. For example we enjoy to cook food she cook Chinese food or I cook Korean food both of us like vegetables to do exercise watching movie having a party and to study bible. She introduced me to her American friends I also introduced her to Korean friend. She really likes Korean people especially Korean man. Fortunately we are long distance age. It means she is 19 and I'm 26. That means we can't love on man. In addition we don't have girl sibling. We are like sibling. Her parents also like me and they are very nice person. I feel like my parents. I can feel that here is home even though here is not. She has planned to come to Korea next summer to study abroad. I think we'll be good friend since I leave here.
