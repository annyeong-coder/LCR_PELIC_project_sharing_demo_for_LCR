I strongly agree that Media pay too much attention to personal lives of famous people. Exploit famous people lives for marketing and advertising issues rather music movies albums or even brands that celebrities use. Media use to emphasize the luxury lives that celebrities have and imply that their lives are perfect so audience follow their styles.
