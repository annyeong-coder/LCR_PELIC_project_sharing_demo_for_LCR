When I was a child we had to adapt our educational environment they didn't give us space to use our creativity. Every classes had a rigid framework actually the target I only had was to get the good score. It emerges our education policy that has some problems. I'm very poor to make a choice it attributes to the development of my personality which affects my creativity. I were a very classic Chinese student I didn't violate any rule which the teacher made and I studied very hard I entered into the good school and tried to defeat the other students. Now I know the creativity is very important because trying to be the unique one is much better than to be the top one. I'm so regretted that I'm weak that I can't challenge the traditional Chinese concept.
