My name is Student's Name and I'm from Thailand. Some of my friends are calling me Ath because it's my nickname. I'm studying English here at the ELI because I want to attend the Joseph M. Katz Graduate School of Business. When I have free time I like to play computer games and chat with my friends via MSN. Sometimes I go to see movies on weekend.
