Parents should take responsibility for their children and discipline them. However some parents don't punish their children because they think that too much punishment hurts their children's personality. They also think children's bad behavior is a part of their character. And they think children's bad behavior and the responsibility are not connected so they think that they don't need take responsibility. Nevertheless this society is not for only them so it is important to think another people. Parents should take responsibility for their children's behavior. Parents need to teach to their children about moral and take responsibility. If they don't do this parents have to take responsibility. This is right thing to do and will be a good influence for children.
