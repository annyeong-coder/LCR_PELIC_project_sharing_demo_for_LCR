ANON_NAME_0 Chung ANON_NAME_1 Eason Who is your best teacher My high school teachr Miss Lin would be my best teacher. Miss Lin was not only our class advisor but also our English teacher. As she mentioned we knew that she majored in English hence she always urged us to study English very hard. For instance she made us practice examinations in English every morning and also let us do a lot of homeworks. We knew that she just want to help us to study English well. However she actually get us to carry too many burdens. Beacuse we were not just studying English in the school we still need to take mathmatic chemical society and classico Chinese courses as well.
