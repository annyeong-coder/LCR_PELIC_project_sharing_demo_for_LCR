The Movie and The book of The English Patient The English Patient is one of the few stories I read or saw both books and movies. I read the book because I saw the movie and I liked it but I like the book more. Both the book and the movie are beautiful story. On the other hand the book contains more episodes and scenes. The same feature of the book and the movie is the impressive scenes. The original story of the book is consisted from many scenes both present and memory which likes jigsaw puzzle. In the story there are two parallel love stories. One is the story from the memory of the English patient and the other is the story between Hana a young nurse and Kip an Indian sapper which occur during the story. Stories in both the book and the movie made of many beautiful scenes. The author Michael Ondaatje is also a poet and the book contains many poetical words. The movie shows the beautiful images instead of using the words. The biggest difference is that the book contains more episodes and scenes. Especially the book contains more episodes about Kip. The episodes of his days before he met Hana and the English patient are one of the attractive points of the book. The memory of Lord Suffolk the Kip's teacher in past days and he welcomed Kip to his coworkers is removed from the movie. It is reasonable to reduce episodes to adapt into the movie. If it had included all scenes the movie couldn't finish within 2 hours and been to complex to understand.
