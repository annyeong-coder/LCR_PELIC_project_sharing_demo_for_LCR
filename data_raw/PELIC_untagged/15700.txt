If I were missing something or someone and a person claiming to be psychic offered to help me find that thing or person I will accept his or her help. The reason for me to accept is that I should try every thing before I give up and do not reject the idea of psychics before I try it. In fact people should not give opinions about things without having a proof that support or appose them. Also there are some phenomenal things that since has not discover an explanation for yet. So people should not refuse the help of people that may or may not have the answer just because they are using something new or different than what we are used to.
