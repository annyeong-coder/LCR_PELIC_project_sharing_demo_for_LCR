Gambling is game that player throw money to bet their cards or something can let them have fun and get money but also can kill themselves and the family. We must control ourselves when we play this. Gambling has many kinds of games. Some of use cards some of use dice some of just put money in the machines and play. For example big old two 13cards and poker are use cards. One of game name sibala use dice. Pinball and 777 are use machine. I think Las Vegas has the most gambling machine in the world. It's a good place for gambling. Actually I play poker with my friends almost every week. One thing is good that we all know how to control ourselves. For example we didn't spend a lot of money when we play poker. Each time we play just spend 20 30 bucks and we never borrow money to play it. One of my friends told me We just play for fun and we are all good friends so win lot money from friends makes me feel bad. I agree with this. Some of my friends in Taiwan don't know how to control themselves. For example they borrow a lot of money from bank or other friends when they lost a lot but they keep play. After that they can't give it back so they have to borrow some money from others. The situation keeps like this so when they can't give the money back they have to hide themselves. Now still have many people kill them when they can't give the money back. They finished their life that no one can take care of the family. The problem became more and more. Gambling is very excited but the point is that we have to control ourselves.
