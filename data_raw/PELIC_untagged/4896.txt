There are many interesting historical events in Japan. What is particularly major is event of New Year's Day. Japanese have celebrated it for a long time. It has been a special day for young and old of both sexes. There are lots of events which are done on New Year's Day. My favorite events are a New Year's card traditional foods visiting to shrine first of the year. A New Year's card is most popular in Japan. We began to write it from around the middle of December. We can remember our precious friends who we can rarely meet because of our distance or our busy lives while we are making the card. Even if the computer society is spread in Japan almost of Japanese write it by letter. Japanese eat some traditional foods in New Year Day for long time. There are many reasons for it. For example we eat simmer black soybeans some sea tangles and herring roe and so on to be superstitious. On the other hand because women have to work harder to greet a New Years Day from the end of December all traditional foods are made to be able to keep in a long time to take a rest. Their visuals are beautiful and tastes are so nice. Therefore I like all New Year's foods. Japanese often visit to shrine in the early of January. We pray our good luck for the year. And we often draw a written fortune. If the fortune we drew predicted very good luck it made us so happy. Furthermore we sometimes visit there wearing a traditional cloth which is called Kimono. I like New Year's Dar because I can enjoy many traditional cultures. Probably even if times have changed these traditional events would keep up forever.
