I lived with a native American family and I have a small room in the house. I like my room very much even though it is very small. They are very friendly people before I lived in this room they had already hanged up a board for me to help me remind something. They had moved around the bed so the room could look more bigger than usual and they cover a rug up in my room I like the rug but I don't like the rug's color. It's blue and I have to use the vacuum to straighten it up. I don't like the vacuum very much because I hate to hear that noise. What's more they have taken away their photos so I could put my own picture. And after that I have fall in love with my room.
