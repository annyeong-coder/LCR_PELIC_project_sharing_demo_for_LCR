I had a summer vacation in 2007 . I went to Laos and Thailand and I really liked Phibun Mangsahan in Thailand . I visited some Pagodas and some cultural centers there . I had a chance to get information about Thailand's Buddhism with my friends . Also I went to places all over this city to know their culture and their life . I had a week there and I felt very interested because that was the first time I went to a foreign country and I had many experiences and much to learn by going to another country .
