I knew a lot of friends in the university. While I was a freshman I lived in an apartment with my friend. He gave me a ride when my motorcycle broke down at midnight. We helped each other in difficult situations. We studied hard together. We had the same hobbies such as playing basketball and watching baseball games. We liked to go traveling together. Afterward he became my great friend.
