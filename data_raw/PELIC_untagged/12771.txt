Although the US government discourages the US citizens from smoking the agriculture department and the USTR still encourage the cigarette is sold in international market for the reason of getting money and benefits. They even threat the countries which have anti smoking policies to open their markets. If these countries don't open markets the US government will refuse to help these countries. The US government's attitude leads to the high smoking rates in these countries which is very harmful and unfair.
