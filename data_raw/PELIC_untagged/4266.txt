About Learning English Learning English is the best way to make friends. I have two reasons why I believe this is so. One reason is that learning English is the best way to make friends because I can meet a lot of people in an English school. For instance I can talk to people who are from Korea China Saudi Arabia Spain and Turkey etc. I can exchange culture and language in the school. In other words going to the English school is not only to learn English but also to make friends. Another reason is that learning English is the best way to make friends because I can talk to people who can't speak Japanese in English. Even if I meet a lot of people in the school if I don't speak English I would not be able to make a lot of friends. Also if I go to foreign countries most people can speak English. So I can make friends while traveling. In other words learning English is necessary to make friends in the world. Above that I would say that learning English gives me the best opportunity and way to make friends.
