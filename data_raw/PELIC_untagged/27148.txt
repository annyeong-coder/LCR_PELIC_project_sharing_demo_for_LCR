Driver's License I got my driver's license before 2 months. Before I had it I was very excited because I had been waiting for 18 years before getting one. Before the test I was afraid to fail and be a joke between my friends. So I told them that I will not do the test but the reminded me that I had been practicing for a week and I must pass the test. And finally I passed the test and got it. Then I was thinking that without my friends encouraging me I wouldn't have a driver's license so they are the best.
