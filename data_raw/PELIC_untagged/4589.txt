I have been most influenced by my English teacher in high school. When I was in the first grade I felt frustrated and depressed with the result of the first exam. My score in English class was only fifty! But my teacher did not rebuke me. Instead he wanted to know what the problem was with me. I was helped by my teacher to study English with confidence. I was taught by him in class. But at the same time I was persuaded by my teacher to read many other books in English. He also told me about the chances lying before me. I was encouraged to have a bigger dream for future. His influence can be seen in many parts of my life. When I was a freshman in university I joined the Sungkyun Times the press center publishing English Newspapers to get more opportunities for developing my English. In addition I could never have thought about studying abroad without his teaching and help. My English teacher will always be remembered by me for his guidance and encouragement.
