I was born in Seoul Korea and I lived there for about thirty years until I moved to Pittsburgh. I moved to Pittsburgh this January and I felt several things about two cities. In this essay I want to say about Seoul and Pittsburgh in some points of view environment facilities and fashions. Both of Seoul and Pittsburgh have rivers mountains and many parks in them. Even though they have similar in big features the details are deferent. I think that Pittsburgh people are more natural and live in green. In Pittsburgh many parks are really connected to people's life. Everyday people work out at the park near their house make a walk with their dogs. In other hands people in Seoul go to park usually in special day such as Sunday or holidays. Most of people in Pittsburgh live in house having garden but most of people in Seoul live in apartments. In Seoul there are hundreds of 24 hours market all over the city. While almost shops in Pittsburgh closed at 7PM in Seoul most of the stores open until 9PM and most of the restaurants run until 11PM. That is really convenient for living. Especially night lives are highly developed in Seoul so the streets are luxurious and there are too many things to do at night. In contrast in Pittsburgh family life is bigger portion for people so they spend their time at home with family after evening. People in Seoul are really interested in fashion. They enjoy dress up accesseries and hair styling so there are many hair shops and accessary stores in Seoul. It is easy to find women who wear micro mini skirts in Winter for their beauty. However almost people in Pittsburgh don't care there wearing. They like clothes that are comfortable to them. You can see many people who wear sports wear and running shoes in the street while they are not in exercising.
