I saw X Men Origins Wolverine which shows how Wolverine comes into the world last month. I was worried about that I can't understand the story which might rely on the last X men series. But I could figure it out except the last part of movie because it revealed the behind story which explains why Wolverine decided to revenge as its title. Sometimes it was too cruel for me but the friend who watched the movie with me said that the animation or the game that are based on Wolverine's story are crueler than the movie. The movie took almost 2 hours but I didn't feel bored only a minute because it was filled with lots of action scenes which I like to watch. I will watch the other episodes of X men which I didn't see yet.
