Five years ago I was studying engineering in KFUPM in Daharan. I lived in Daharan because of my studying. My father had a job. Since then my father has retired. I have graduated from KFUPM. I have gotten a good job in my hometown. My employer gave me a scholarship to complete my high studies. Because of that I am here in the US.
