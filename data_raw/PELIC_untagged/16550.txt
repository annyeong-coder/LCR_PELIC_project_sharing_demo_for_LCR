Being sick in the weekend makes you extremely mad. That is exactly what's happen to me in the last weekend. On the last Saturday I felt like I am dizzy and uncomfortable at all so I asked my friend to take me to the UPMC hospital and unfortunately I spent the whole day their fighting the pain. Therefore my last Sunday was only laying on bed and having my tablets in the times which the doctor mention it in the report. Actually I think that seeing your friends hanging out while you are disable to leave your bed makes your mood more worse. Moreover although I felt better on Monday but the mood was still awful the reason as I think is that I felt really like I missed my weekend enjoyment. However a lot of people may take the I know such things easy but it was really a mass for me.
