The Night View from My Window The night view from my window was beautiful for me. At first when I looked at the view from my window. The full moon was in the middle so the view was bright. Second I saw the stars and the sky at the top. The stars cross the sky and they twinkle. The view felt like magic. Third some buildings and a church were to the right of the moon. Buildings had a little light shining from the top to the bottom. The bright made me feel safe and happy. Because I liked fell bright. Forth a park was to the left of the building. Moonlight to beam the coco tree and wind below the trees. Look at the sight that I felt relax and free. Finally I don't know why but I thought the sight was the beautiful view in my mind.
