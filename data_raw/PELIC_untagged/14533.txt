My food pyramid divides the food I eat into seven groups the Grain Group Vegetable Group Fruit Group Milk Group Meat Group Fats Group and Seasoning Group. The first group the Grain Group includes rice bread and pasta. This group is at the right side of the pyramid because the Grain Group is the biggest part of what I eat all day. I eat rice for every supper. The next is Vegetable and Fruit Group. I put this group next to the Grain Group. A lot of Japanese food is made from vegetables like Natto beans Nori seaweed Toufu beans . I eat soybeans instead of eating meat because they are nourishment like meat. The fourth and fifth food groups are Milk and Meat Group. These groups are next to the Vegetable and Fruit Group. I need milk and meat group food for making my body and bone but dont need too much. If you eat too much that causes ageing and aneurysm. The last is Fat group and Seasoning Group. These are the smallest part of the pyramid. I always use soy sauce and sake for cooking. After I think about the food pyramid I can understand what I eat now and what I should eat. I noticed the Japanese foods involve a lot of vegetable. I unconsciously took balanced food. I should be careful about the fat and seasoning and keep my health.
