My hometown is small city. It name is Eregli. The Turkish name Karadeniz Ereli means Black Sea Ereli which distinguishes it from other places called Ereli the name Ereli derives from Heraclea . Turkey's largest steel plant is in my city. We have a four season. Eregli in the north side in my country. Near the black see. We have a beach. Almost population is one hundred thousand. We don t have a airport. But rail road and highway is very strong. People is very friendly.
