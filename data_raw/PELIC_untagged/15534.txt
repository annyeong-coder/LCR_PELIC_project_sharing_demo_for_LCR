Many people have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep for an adequate amount of time. I want to give them some solutions to help them fall asleep well. First you should drink warm milk about one hour before you fall asleep. Milk has tryptophan in it. It always helps people sleep. In addition you had better not drink coffee or beverage that has caffeine. It stimulates your nervous system so if you drink much caffeine you won't fall asleep for a long time. Also you ought to take a walk after supper. It will make you more tired and be helpful for you to fall asleep easily. Finally taking shower using warm water about an hour before bedtime is good for you. These solutions are not hard but they have enough effects. How about trying one of these You will be able to blow your trouble out.
