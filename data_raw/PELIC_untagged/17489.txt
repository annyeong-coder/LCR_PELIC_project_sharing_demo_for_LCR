I do believe that there is relation between learning and creativity. However learning can be creative but creative cannot be learning. In other words it is not necessary that every student is a creative. Also some students have talents while others not. So some schools try to control or restrict the students focusing on the creativity and encourage them to be interested in learning and creativity at the same time. That is to say it is not easy to attract students for learning lonely but whenever they allow to do some things creative absolutely they will like learning as well as creativity.
