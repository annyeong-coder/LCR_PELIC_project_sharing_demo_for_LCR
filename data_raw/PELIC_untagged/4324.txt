Instead of quitting suddenly I should have tried to talk with people in the Human Resource Division. They could have offered me another department or a transfer. I regretted as soon as I quit my job. Actually my boss should have refused my resignation. I had worked so hard and I had done so many things for him. Of course I could have talked with him in person but I could not accept his demeanor. Many other co workers might feel the same way. I do not understand why he has not been fired yet. He must have some kind of connection with high level people. However high level people are supposed to fire a person like my boss. Maybe I shouldn't have quit so suddenly. I could have changed our whole company.
