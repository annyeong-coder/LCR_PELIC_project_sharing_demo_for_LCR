Sports star earn ridiculously salaries in all over the world. For example the football in Saudi Arabia makes a really crazy big amount of money and the football player can make a huge amount of money if he plays well. For example there were one football club had bought a player from another club and they offer them to buy that player if they agree 15 000 000 million S. R. It was very easy for them to pay that big a mount of money. Because of they want another player another football player have paid the amount of 19 000 000 million S. R. For the second big contrast to get that player plays for them. Nobody believe that another crazy business is coming after this club thought to have the player plays for them for 25 000 000 million S. R. And it was the biggest in the Saudi Arabia football transfer from a club to another. Whenever there is a superior player in football you can see the clubs being as a competitor trying to get that player to plays for them. It's like an auction whenever someone offers the most money the player is playing to them. Only if the player likes to play for one specific club or prefer to be a member of them the auction won't complete because of him want to play for them. Even if the player won't to play for some clubs sometime they keep offering the crazy big amount of money trying to get them anyway.
