According to the author adults could be one of the reasons why they lose the sense of pleasure in their own learning. For example the adults pull them away tugging at them and telling them enough stop it and let's go. Those actions prevent them from creativity. I agree with author. When I was in school back home there were limits we were not allowed to be creative because we had to follow teachers instruction.
