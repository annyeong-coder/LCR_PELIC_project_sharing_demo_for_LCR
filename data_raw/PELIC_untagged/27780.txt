Sometimes when my cell phone rang it was a wrong number. I had difficulty understood because she or he spook very fast. I kept on to ask her or him repeat. I tried to figure out what she or he saying. Then I talked into the same title such as when she or he said to me a wrong name I said sorry the number was wrong. She or he had to give up said sorry and hang up. Sometimes the same number call again when I end up the calling. I think over about it. Then I hold on my call phone.
