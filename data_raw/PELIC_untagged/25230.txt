Learning English is one of my goals in my life. The effective way to do that is to live and study in the place that the launguge is spoken. For that I applied for scholarship from my government. After I got the scholarship I decide to study in the Stats because my father studied there. And then I search for the best schools and contact them. After that I got acception from two schools and Pitt University was one of them. So this time I google the two cities for comparison. The activities that Pittsburgh got was the reason for chosen it. After that I applied for a visa. Also I booked a flight. Now I'm in Pittsburgh trying to achieve my goal.
