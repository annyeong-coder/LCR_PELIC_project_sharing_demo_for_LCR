When I lived in Korea I should have spent a lot of money because I earned money myself so I had no idea about a sense of economy. Whenever I earn some money I spent all money at once. However Today I am changing a strategy to spend money of ways. There are several ways how can I save some money. First of all I always prepare a lunch. It gives me to save some money. After all I do not like the cafeteria food of CL. Second As much as possible I want to use my debt card because I do not want to make some coins. Finally I write an account book of mine. It is really useful for me. These days I should keep my money for a long time because I can not earn money in the U. S.
