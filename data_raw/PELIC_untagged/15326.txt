When I arrived to Pittsburgh I came across with interesting way of making a friend. Unlike almost everybody says it is not easy to make a friend it has been easy for me. Particularly I find a chance to make a friend with participating in some activities. For instance at the international fair someone liked my dessert and request its recipe. I offered her to meet. We made an appointment. We will meet next week. Thus another meeting door opened for me. I have become aware of significance of participating in activities organizations and being social.
