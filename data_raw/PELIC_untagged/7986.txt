I have been satisfied with having a lot of free time and learning about the different culture. I never have been bothered about the family's problem except my daughter's family while I have lived in a foreign country. Although there are a lot of difficulty to live in a foreign country I have been trying to be accustomed to the new situation and looking forward to being able to meet with a nice person.
