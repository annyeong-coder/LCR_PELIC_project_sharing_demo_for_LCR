I think I have had flow for activities every single day of my life. My head is flying above and beyond most of the time but usually when I am alone working in things that I love crazily I get this flow state where schedules other assignments meal time doesn't matter. To be more specific generally music photography design and art are things that help me be in flow and also are answers results that I produce while I am in flow. For this reason flow and creativity are totally related in my life.
