One of the Biggest Festival in Korea 'Sul day' l and make our minds clean and calm. This preparation is as integral as doing the main ceremony in the precise order. L ate all stuff we made and then we straighten up the space where the ceremony was done. After the meal we take a rest and say hello to each other by doing Jul. At this time Jul has a little different meaning with the one in the ceremony the previous one is to pray for a peaceful life to our ancestors and later one is to appreciate our elders for taking care us well. Therefore usually young people greet older relatives by doing Jul. At the same time the older people accept the greeting sitting on the floor and then they give some pocket money called 'New Year's Jul money' to the younger people. This moment is cherished especially by kids and of course it was always a quite meaningful event for me when I was a child. Able event for Korean people to stay with family and relatives to appreciate everyone surrounding us and to pray for a healthful and stable future. Because of these reasons Sul day has been generated for a long time and thought to be one of the most considerable festivals in Korea.
