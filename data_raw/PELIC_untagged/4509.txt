ANON_NAME_0 would be a good roommate for me because we have the same schedule and have the same hobbies. It would be beneficial for studying English to each other because we are the same ELI student. Next we like to watch TV play soccer and we also know how to cook. And we have almost same schedule. Finally we are not single. So we would understand each other.
