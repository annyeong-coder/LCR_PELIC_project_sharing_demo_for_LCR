My Grandparents' Farm In Turkey my Grandparents are living in a big farm which is the best place for me because I always feel happy when I visit it with my family. We have a small house at the end of the farm it is a white home with many big windows. I often sit in front of a window and watch some dogs playing in the garden. In the center of the farm there is a wheat field. I like the sound of the wheat at the windy days and I also like it's color in the summer when it become yellow instead of green. Behind the field there are three big apple trees. My sister and I love to climb the trees and challenge each other of who can reach a highest point. In the summer I like the beautiful view of the trees having small apples. Beside these trees there is a well. I help my grandfather in the morning to get some water to water the plants. We have many kind of plants such us onions tomatoes and mints. I feel happy when I water the plants because I help them to grew up. In conclusion my grandparents' farm is a special place for me because I do many interesting things that makes me happy.
