In my opinion I thing the art can not come to anybody spontaneously. First of all the artists should have corporate hobbies. Also they should improve their hobbies by training. Second they have to develop their skills with diverse methods. In addition they need more and more training to become the outcomes very well. Finally anyone can not create art without hobby and training so the art can not be spontaneity.
