Margot quietly stared other children. Although her eyes were brimming with tears she tried to do not cry. Children couldn't say anything. After the long silence she opened her mouth. Her voice was calm but wavered. Was Was it flamed like a fire in the stove Or was it like a yellow crayon Or was it looks like a flaming bronze None of the children could answer it. The only image still in their mind was an excitement that couldn't be controlled. It was just the sun one of them said. Margot closed her eyes. And she tried to remind how the sun looked. However she couldn't remember anything of the sun which she watched on the earth. The only image about the sun was depression and sorrow. Well Okay. It was just the sun. Margot tried to think that the sun is not a special thing. She tried to forget it and put it out of her mind. She decided to enjoy rainy days. She should wait 7 more years to see the sun. And she couldn't let 7 years to be filled with deep sorrow. She made up her mind to wait little bit more. Since she have waited for the sun and her parents for a long time waiting is not difficult anymore. For her the sun wasn't a special thing anymore. The sun was just the sun.
