I have an embarrassing experience. Exactly one year ago today I gave birth to a boy in Magee Women's Hospital of UPMC. I had really been scared of delivery because the son is my first baby. Every day I walked around Shadyside for one hour in order to strengthen my body and I had never left walking practice out for one month. One year ago today was the day I was supposed to meet my doctor at 10 AM to check my condition and my baby's. In the day morning I felt some pain which was different compared to other days. I and my husband went to hospital by bus and I felt something would be happened. At 5 30 PM I got a very cute boy. I was not surprised that it didn't take a long time for delivery but also most of the doctors and nurses in my room were surprised about that. After that every single person who came to my room said about my quick delivery. One nurse said I'm jealous of you I was taken for almost 24 hours. I was just happy when I first heard about the words but I started to be embarrassed when every single person said to me. After three days I discharged from hospital with my treasure my son it was one of embarrassing experiences.
