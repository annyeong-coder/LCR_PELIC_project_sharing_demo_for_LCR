I used to live in INDIA. And I had some great memories of it. I have done my college in Andhra University upto 12th standard. We used to enjoy a lot in those days. As my mother is very strict about studies I am very much afraid her and studied well. One day I got very less marks in maths and I was afraid about my mother and ran to my aunties house from the town which I used to stay. After 10 days my parents found me and bought back to my house. And when it comes to the present life I was very happy and relax. As I'm going to learn some english. My son doughter in law and my wife are taking care of me with great respect. And my son got good job in IT field we all are happy. The only thing that matters to me is that I'm missing my childhood friends in INDIA.
