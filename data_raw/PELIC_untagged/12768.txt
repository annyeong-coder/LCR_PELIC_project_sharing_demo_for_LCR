Although some developing countries forbid the tobacco advertising to be shown in media tobacco companies still can find ways to go around the law. They advertise nontobacco products after their brands which can imply young people to buy the cigarette of these brands. They use tobacco logos when they sponsor sports events and often use their logos on TV without mentioning tobacco. These measures are all useful to attract young people to smoke.
