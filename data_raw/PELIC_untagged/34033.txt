Hi agony aunt I am a follower of this news paper's this column. You know why especially this column Because I am the one who needs help. I've been reading all of your advice that you always give to the people who have various problems either. I've been thinking about whether to share this problem or not. However the trouble maker caused me to reach up to this point. Yes ma'am I am talking about my son who is hyperactive!! Maybe before sharing this problem I should have taken him away to the doctor. He has extraordinary behaviors such as climbing up to the wall and trying to reach garrets of the room. I've never been able to stop him from running jumping and shouting. He has never been sleeping in his bed since he was started to move by himself 2 year old . He prefers to sleep on the closet or the dinner table. He has been becoming worse day by day instead of being better. This is a kind of urgent issue please give me a suggestion advice whatever to be able to keep my rest of life healthy. Thank you in advance. Hi Mrs blank! First of all you should try to be relax because of exciting you didn't even write your name on it. As far as I can understood this little boy drives you up to the wall while he is climbing up to the wall as well No wonders this is a really tough situation. All your complaints indicate that you've already exploded. Despite causing all these problems he is your son ma'am and he is still a child. You might get angry while you are reading that but you have to be patient. You said that you needed to take him away to a doctor. I am extremely opposed to seeing a doctor for these kind of innocent children. I assure you the doctor could give him a plenty of medicines which create a new problems to his childhood. You must pay more attention to him and find the another ways to make him relieved. You ought to have positive outlook on this situation at least you have a child who is a gift from God. Thank you.
