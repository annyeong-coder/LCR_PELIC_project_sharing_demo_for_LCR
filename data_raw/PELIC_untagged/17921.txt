My friend name is Annett. She is really nice person I love her very much. We understand each other very well. She cheer me up when I bring down. When she have the problems I always go along with her and we together try figure out why it was happened. Her apartment leave out bath only shower and when she wants to have a bath she can visit mine apartment any time. Sometimes we have chopping together and always pick out wonderful and interesting things. She likes to write letters and cards which she creates by herself and after party or our meeting I a have beautiful card or letter where she write down very kind words.
