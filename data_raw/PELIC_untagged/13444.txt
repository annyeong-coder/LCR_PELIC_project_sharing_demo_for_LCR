Pressure of international student 1. Preparation for travel. 2. Financial resoures 3. Cultural adjustment. There is a lot of challengs that the international student should face handle and solve it starting from the preparation for travel financial resoures ending with cultural difference and adjustment From my experience preparation for travel to the U. S. A was the biggest pressure to me first of all I should get the academic application or language application which mean a lot of trial to contact different no. Of universities secondly to travel to the USA I get the visa which mean I should travel to neighour country like Tunisas or Egypt because we don't have American ambessy in my country . So preparing my self and my family to travel was the biggest pressure I face. Trasvelling to other country for study that is mean you should have good financial resoures for e. Travellinfrom my country to the U. S. A the ticket will coost you about 1500 and about half ticket for child. Also the rent of an apartment is very expensive comparing with that in my country also the price of good here is very expensive for ex. Acup of yagourt cost five time more than that in my country.
