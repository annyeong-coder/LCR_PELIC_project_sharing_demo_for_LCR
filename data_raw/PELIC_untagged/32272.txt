Mar. 11 2012 Grammar Benson Sixteen year ago When I was in junior high school I used to read newspapers and I would read every day during junior and senior high school one of the reports changed my vision and my dream that reported about a CEO of Internet Equipment Company the report descripted his education work and how to plan his career when he was young so I wanted to be an engineer since then. So when I graduated from university I changed my studying of area because I studied biomedical engineer in university my main object was mechanical in research institute therefor I have learnt mechanic since eight years ago and I have been a mechanical engineer in a mechanical company for three years. And I have lived in a city of Mid Taiwan since three years ago my house is closer to my company I have tried to acquire mechanical patents since 2010 and I have gained a patent since for one year ago.
