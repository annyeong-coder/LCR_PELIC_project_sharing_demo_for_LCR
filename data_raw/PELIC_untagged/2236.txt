Most people have a study routine or writing habit. However I don't have a special study routine because I don't care about that. I just like to study with a comfortable feeling. I usually study with my friends. I don't care where the place is. For instance I can study on a bed or on the ground. My own habit is to study with soft light some paper and a highlighter. I used to have a lot of break times for studying. However I don't have a lot of break times now because I have a lot of classes. Therefore I will change my writhing habits so I can finish my homework after class.
