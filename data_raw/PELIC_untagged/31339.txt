Los Angeles and Pittsburgh Los Angeles is a more diverse city differs from Pittsburgh the population in California is completely different more than one third are Hispanic in contrast Pittsburgh the Hispanic population is only 20 000 in Allegheny county Because of my Hispanic origin I am interested in this topic I visited Los Angeles five years ago I was surprise about the fact that there were so many Hispanic people in the subway almost 100 were Hispanic and white people looked like a tourist . North Hollywood where I was leaving for five month is a really nice areas close to valley college the Hispanic influence was huge the American super markets were only a few an a new class the supermarket it have emerged there were something like a Mexican supermarkets their name is Vallarta super markets they were replacing the American super markets those markets they offered more Hispanic products and the worker were bilingual or mostly Spanish speaker even the decoration resemble I supposed an Mexican city they were so many Mexican supermarkets that they replacing the American markets the it was for me something extremely weird and I talking about white neighborhoods I do not why probably because the offer different kind of fresh product like in Latin America where you don't buy a frozen chicken or frozen peas mostly they were fresh vegetables fruits and meats. Safety Los Angeles is a big city there is more crime in contrast with Pittsburgh where I feel more safe even though there are some black neighborhoods that they are kind of dangerous like east liberty and Hill district my husband was student in LA and they stole his bike three times in the bus station. The traffic law enforcement is more severe in LA compared to Pittsburgh you cannot be jaywalker in LA because you will get a ticket 70 dollars you will wait for the green light even if you are pedestrian unless you want to get a ticket you can notice if you visited Hollywood who is not from LA if you see a jaywalker he is not from LA is a tourist even bicyclist get tickets ask my husband he got 150 dollars ticket. Los Angeles offers universal health care system for children no matter their immigration status there is MediCal for adults without insurance that offers free medical attention for underserved population again no matter your immigration status birth control is also available for free if you cannot afford it very different from Pittsburgh where children that they are not citizens do not have free health care here the lack of insurance is a really a sad situation. Los Angeles offers free day care in many community college I can say for my personal experience with better facilities and better quality on the contrary you cannot get this servicers in Pittsburgh I was waiting more than two years to get an spot in a day care in the university and it costs 1000 dollars per month. Ride a bus can be more fun in Los Angeles there are poems in the busses and there are some kind of computers screens in the busses you can watch news and biographies of important people in the American history and is available in two languages English and Spanish in los Angeles you can buy a day pass and you can ride the bus for unlimited times different from Pittsburgh that you cannot see poems in the buses and there is not day pass and the bus ANON_NAME_0 is more expensive. Housing in Los Angeles is expensive one bedroom apartment fluctuate between 1000 1200 dollars compared to Pittsburgh where you can find an one apartment for 700 dollars In conclusion there are advantages and disadvantages of living in Pittsburgh if you compared with los Angeles but I prefer to live in small city like Pittsburgh the university is close to my home my husband's job is only a few blocks from my apartment and we feel safe living here. Los Angeles can be an alternative for people who want to live like in Latin America with all the advantages that America offers.
