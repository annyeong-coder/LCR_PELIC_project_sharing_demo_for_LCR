My favorite memories are a day that I left to Japan and traveled in there for 7 days. On march 31st my flight took off in early morning but 2 of my friends still came to see me off. One of them her name is Joon who studied together with me since kindergarten and the other one is Beer who went to the same school with me since grade 8. My family and my uncle who had lived in Portland Oregon for 38 years also went there too. I started crying with my mom and my younger brother who is studying engineering and it was the first time that I saw my dad who also is my tennis coach cried. When I boarded for Tokyo which is capital of Japan I took stitch doll which is Walt Disney's character with me and a lot of children looked at me like I'm too old to have it . It was funny. I arrived in Narita airport in the evening 1 of my Japanese friends ANON_NAME_0 who was exchange student in my university picked me up at the airport and took me to Ayako's house which in Sasasuka and she also was exchange student in my university too. It was good timing that I went to Tokyo at the end of March because cherry blossoms were blooming at that time everywhere in Tokyo and I saw Chinese couple took a wedding photo shoot in Shinjuku Park which is famous place to see cherry blossoms. It's a good idea. I want to do that too ! And I went to Harajuku which is a famous place to take pictures with cosplay soku who dresses like a character in Japanese cartoon. And also I saw a traditional Japanese wedding which rare to see nowadays. It's all about my favorite memories. I saw learned and grew up since I left Thailand and I think now Pittsburgh is one of my favorite memories too especially when the Penguins won the Stanley Cup.
