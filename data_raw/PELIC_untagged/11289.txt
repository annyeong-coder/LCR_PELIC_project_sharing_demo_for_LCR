One of my friends who is a lawyer told me this story when he was taking his law classes. He read this story one of his law books. A man who was accused of housebreaking appeared in court. He had placed his arm through the window of a house and stolen some money which was laying on a table inside. Argument that the man's lawyer put forward wasn't very impressive. He said that it was the man's arm which had done the crime and not the man himself. You can not punish a man of what his arm had done said the lawyer. Now the judge in whose court the man was appearing wanted to show how stupid the lawyer's argument was. Instead of finding the man's guilty he found the man's arm guilty and sent it to prison. The judge said that he can go prison with his arm or not he chooses which made everyone laugh. But what the judge did not know that man had an artificial arm. He gave the arm to the judge who could hardly believe his eyes and walked out of the court.
