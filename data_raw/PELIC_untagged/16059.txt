When I applied for an ESL school I applied in another school in Pittsburgh because I had to get an I 20 form to apply for a visa. They gave me 9 months I 20 so I applied for the visa and I got the 9 months visa. Their teaching wasn't that good and I spent 3 months in their institutes and then I transferred to ELI. In ELI I saw the difference between those two schools and I regret studying there 3 months. I should have been an ELI student from the beginning and I could have gotten 16 months I 20 so I might have had 16 months visa. I shouldn't wasted my time there and I ought to have applied to the ELI so I could seized my time and I should have been a grammar 5 student by now.
