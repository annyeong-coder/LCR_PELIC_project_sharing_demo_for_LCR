Traveling abroad When you travel remember that a foreign country is not designed to make you comfortable. It is designed to make its own people comfortable. Clifton Fadiman says. The majority of travelers are students and tourists. Culture differences and language difficulties are the most challenges fro those people. Travelers are always faced problems in a foreign country by culture differences. Ones I have been in embarrassing situation in china. On my birthday I was invited to my friends' home and that was my first time to have party there. They were presented with gifts I thanked them and started to open them. She asked me are you going to open them now In Chinese culture you are not expected to open your gift immediately after receiving it. Other anecdote is in Saudi Arabia. I invited my friend from America and named William to my house. He saw a big watch on my friend's hand when he said he liked it my friend insisted on giving it to him. Many middle easterners feel obligated to give something to someone who admires it. My friend kept insisting but William didn't want to accept it. Language difficulties can be the most difficult challenges. One of the predicament that I had in the United States is I have been in Washington Dallas airport and met glamorous girl from Chicago. At that time my English was not good enough to have a conversation with others. I tried to tell here who beautiful she was. She talked to me for four or five hours but I did not understand here that much. Later she asked to have dinner and coffee with here. I thought she said she was going to have her dinner. Then I responded ok I had to leave to get some rest. I realized that she wanted me to go and eat with here. For a moment I hated speaking English. Travelers may get upset of culture differences and language difficulties. My advice to them is do not give up and feel satisfied about your self's mistakes. You will be adapting to get them and learn many valuable things in your life.
