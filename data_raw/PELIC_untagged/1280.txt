If I become school president I will do a lot of revolutions to my school. First I will request teachers to be devoted as possible as they could if there are many students who have problems with their school works. Second if students usually have stress with many kinds of problems I will set up a consultative room to help them solve these problems. Third if there are not enough exercise instruments and hardware I will purchase more ones and build bigger and more places for exercising. Because health is very essential to everyone it is necessary to control the nutrition of school cuisine. If I am school president I will not adopt fast food or other kinds of unhealthy food for school restaurant. Finally if I can endeavor after funds I will set up many scholarships to provide students who need them. I think these five promises are the most important and necessary to our students and I believe that if I can make these promises come true our students will have better school life.
