Mongolian basic hotel room I don't think most mongolian basic hotel rooms comfortable. First as you enter the door the mabe you will see the old tv of the left corner. Then you see the old table and cheer on the right of the tv. I think there will be caps on top of table. The bed is behind of the tv and table. The bathroom is right of the bed. Some times the bathroom haven't hot water onle cold water . Mabe there will be picture on top of the bed on the wall. I think most of mongolian basic hotels rooms same and old.
