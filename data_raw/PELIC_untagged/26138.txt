I have wanted to be a teacher since I was a very young child. Also being a student I was deeply affected by the teachers in my school. While I was being taught by the teachers I always wanted to be a teacher like them. When I was 13 years old I decided to go to teachers' college and told my parents about my decision. After listening that my parents opposed to me. Although they wanted me to get a higher income job I persuaded them. After entering teachers' college of the university I'm studying education and preparing to be a teacher. However though I am still an undergraduate I feel sometimes that teaching someone is too difficult for me. Nevertheless because I am sure that it is worthy in spite of the difficulty I have tried to accomplish my dream.
