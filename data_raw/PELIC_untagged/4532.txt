In 1994 during the world cup was in the U. S. By the time 1994 The teams strongest in the world came to the U. S. To played to got on the world cup. Meanwhile I wish I lived in the U. S. To saw those teams. Then to saw new Soccer Stadiums In the U. S. Eventually I wish I came to the U. S meanwhile to saw my country's team.
