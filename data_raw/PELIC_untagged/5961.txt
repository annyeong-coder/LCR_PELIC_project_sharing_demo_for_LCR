Stephen William Hawking was born in Oxford England on January 8 1942. He studied physics at Oxford University then completed his Ph. D at Cambridge University in the field of theoretical physics. In 1979 he was appointed Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge a position once held by Sir Isaac Newton. He has had motor neurone disease for practically all his adult life. He wasn't able to do any sports or physical activities. Also he wasn't able to move all his fingers he could only move a few fingers. He could only communicate by a twitch in his right cheek. Hawking was able to startled the worlds of mathematics and physics in 1974 with his discovery that black holes emit radiation. This fact was contrary to all the prevailing theories at the time. My body may be confined to this chair. But with the Internet my mind can go to the ends of the earth. He said.
