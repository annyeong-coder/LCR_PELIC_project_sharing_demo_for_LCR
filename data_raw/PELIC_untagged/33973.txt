A strong debate has been raised for long time about Should smoking be banned in public places . From my perspective I think yes it should be banned with a little preservation for several reason. . Every body has right in public places even smokers. . Effects on one health . Bad effects on 2nd hand smokers children and ill ppl and pregnant women. . Financial effects of banning of smoking. Tobacco companies vs. Health care system. . Smoking in private places
