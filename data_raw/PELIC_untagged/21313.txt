In my opinion the animal research is justified in the field of medical science. Because the result can help us to find cures of many diseases. It not only saves the lives of humans but also animals. However from animal's perspective whether or not this kind of research is justified is irrelevant. Just because the humans have more powers we do whatever we think is justified. Therefore we should use our power carefully und try our best to minimize the pain and sacrifice.
