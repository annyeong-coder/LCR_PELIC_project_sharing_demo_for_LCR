Oct 16 2006 10 16 Dear Li I moved into a new apartment in recent. I changed my telephone number. My new telephone number is 412 615 1072. Please call me if you are free. I told you that I want to buy a car last letter. In recent I have discovered two different used cars. I both like them but I only buy one. One car was made in Japan Nissan 1998 and another car was made in German Jetta 1995 . I prefer to choose jetta for two reasons. First I think jetta is safer than Nissan. I have often read some reports about cars made in German are more firm than cars made in Japan. Taking German car is more security than taking Japan car. Second The Jetta is cheaper than Nissan. But I like the Nissan car for two reasons. First The Nissan is newer than the Jetta. Another reason is the Nissan has lasted less miles than that of the Jetta. The engine of two cars are very good. It's so hard to choose one. Could you give me some advice. Best regards
