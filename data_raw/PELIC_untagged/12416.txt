Sports are valuable to society because they provide entertainment. Since sports are one of the biggest entertainment events in today's society it can benefit the society in many ways. As sporting events are played in major stadiums a lot of profit can be made from tickets. If a lot of people attend sports games sports teams can also make a lot of money by selling food merchandise etc. While families and friends go to sports games together they can also enjoy great times together. Even if people do not go to the actual sports games they can still watch games on TV. Whenever we turn on the TV we can almost always see some kind of sports game. TV stations compete for their chance to broadcast sports games whenever important sports games like the Super Bowl the World Series or the Stanley Cup is being played. While big games are being show on TV many sports fans gather at home or in bars to watch their favorite teams play. These events provide our society one of the biggest sources of entertainment.
