My apartment is enough large for me. It is cool in this summer. I even do not turn the air conditioner on. I can not straighten up my room because I always hang out with my friend. So every week I put my stuff back where they belong and throw away some trash. That makes my room become clean and tidy. I have some neighbors but I have little commerce with my neighbors. I think I must to get along know my neighbors.
