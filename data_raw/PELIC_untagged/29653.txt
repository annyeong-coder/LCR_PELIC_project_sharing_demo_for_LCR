The news mentioned that there had been a traffic accident at an intersection this morning. The reporter said that two police officers had gone there to take a written record as soon as the accident had happened. One police asked the woman who drove a light brown sedan if she had run the stop light. No I didn't. I obeyed the traffic light she said. The police asked her that when she had seen the other car. She told the police I didn't see that car until I was turning left. He drove fast and crashed my car suddenly. The other police officer asked the man who drove a silver RV that if he was drunk because his face was red. He answered My red face is because the hot sunlight. I didn't drink. How fast you were driving the police asked. The man claimed that he hadn't driven over the speed limit. However a bystander told the reporter that the man had driven really quickly when she had been going to walk across the street.
