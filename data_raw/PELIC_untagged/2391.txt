Center The First Day of 2007 indint At New Year Eve my friends and I was celebrating our Ead holyday. We were so excited and joyful. After the celebration was done all of us went home to sleep. That night was quiet and peaceful. I slept for some hours but after that I woke up early in the morning feeling a bit dizzy. I did not know what was going on with me that time. After that early afternoon I felt worse and my roommate told me that I must go to the hospital. I thought about it then I said to him Ok call one of the guys to take me to the doctor . The guys came and we went to the emergency by their car. After I got registered I sat down in the waiting area. While I was waiting I felt that there was something wrong with my body but I didn't know what. I told one of my friends that I must see the doctor immediately and I couldn't wait any more. They talked to the hospital and someone came and took me inside. I was stiff when I reached the hospital but I didn't know why. I thought may be it was from the changing temperature. When the doctor saw me they took some blood to be tested and they gave me injection food several times I guess 4 times. After more than five hours they came back and said to me that it was a gastric inflammation which was maybe because of drinking lot of tea and coffee. Finally I went back home with some medicine and took a rest for one week then I felt better. It was a very difficult day in my live and I never had that before but I'm Ok now and I'm doing well.
