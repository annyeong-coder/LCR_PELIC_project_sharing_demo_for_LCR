I usually make an idea about a person who she he is at first impression. My first impression is not good about my best friend whose name is Jang sung. I thought that he is a cheater but it was wrong. He is the friend who listens to me when I am worried about my private problems and whom I can be drunk with whenever I need. Now Jang sung is a soldier in Korea I am a foreign student in U. S. We don't have much time that we can meet. But I think this friendship what we have been built for long time is permanent.
