I have already been to Spain. I went there in 2004 and spent alot of time swimming and trying new foods. Also I have never been to South America but I would like to. I would like to visit Mexico and brazil. I would like to surf but I couldn't because we dont have good places for surfing. Finally I would like to buy a car because I've had a car before.
