Nowadays The world is facing many environmental problems like pollution and the extinction of rare animal species another related problem is the decreasing number of trees on earth and as we know trees provide good amounts of the oxygen needed for all species to survive besides the role they play in moderating the climate. In my country this is an escalating problem due to the mass expansion of cities and construction sites which leads to cut large numbers of trees besides cutting the trees for the furniture industry Syria has recently enacted new legislations regarding this problem but it does not seem to be solved in the foreseeable future because there are not enough territories the government is trying to diminish the problem by encouraging construction firms to build higher buildings which reduces the draining of forests and virgin lands.
