In the Earth we have plate tectonics. Earthquakes often occur at the boundaries of tectonic plates because of the activity of tectonic plates. When a plate moves it causes enormous energy and also shaking which we can feel it is an earthquake. Sometimes it destroys buildings or nature. If your home often suffers from big earthquakes you should know the proper preparation before it and the proper procedure during it. Before an earthquake we can prepare for evacuation like food supply and training for evacuation. The first point is the evacuation supply. It would be some food bottles of water flashlights and first aid supplies. Those help us right after the earthquake. The second point is getting some methods to cope with the earthquake. Make sure of the evacuation route in your apartment and town and do an evacuation drill regularly. If you prepare these things before the earthquake has happened your action in evacuating will be smoother and even sometimes it would be a matter of life and death. When the earthquake happens you need a calm behave and proper action immediately. First of all turn off the gas immediately then stay under the table until it's finished. It's also important to stay away from the closet or tall furniture. After the earthquake stopped bring your evacuation goods and go outside following the evacuation route. At that time be calm. Otherwise you will be in panic and forget for what you have been preparing. Making the action right way is very important to be evacuated safely. An earthquake is a natural happening. We cannot stop it from happening. Because of that we can prepare many things for it. Don't just wait until it happened you will reduce the suffering and the damage from the earthquakes.
