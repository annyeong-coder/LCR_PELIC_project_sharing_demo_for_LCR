Happiness Where do we find happiness Most of us know what happiness feels like but we often don't know where to look for it. We often search for it in bars in fancy cars or in big houses. I have found my happiness with my fianc d s also with our dog Lila. I wasn't thrilled about the idea of getting a puppy but after months of Jessie's talking about it I finally succumbed. Today I could not be happier that we made that choice. Through the joyous walks runs games of fetch snowball fights and even the sleepless nights when we were crate training her in the beginning my relationship with Jessie has grown so much stronger. Moreover we have less time to argue about petty problems because she keeps us busy. Lila is our sweetheart. We all choose our own pathway to happiness. Sometimes we get lost on the way. I am so grateful to have finally found my happiness after a long and winding road which has truly taken me across the globe. That happiness is in my home and in my heart.
