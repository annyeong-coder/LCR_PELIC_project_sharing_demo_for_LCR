MY FAVORITE PLACE TO EAT Actually my favorite place to have something to eat is in my home for the following reasons 1. I would to eat our Libyan traditional food for eg COSCOS BASIN AND MACARONIWhich are hardly to be found in any restaurant in PITTSBURGH and even if it is available like macrone I will not taste it the same . 2. I tried before to eat different food when I have been to Tunisia and Egypt but it does not work with me 3. In addition to the above reasons the food from resturant is really expensive . 4. Finally I am lucky that I live here in Pittsburgh with two lovely friends and we cooperate with other to prepare our food at home. As a conclusion traditiona home made food is my favorite one.
