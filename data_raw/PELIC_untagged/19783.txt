12 Mistakes 1 Recent president have made a great many promises they didn't keep. 2 On the economy we've made little progress but we still have a great deal of work to do so there are several measures I'm proposing. 3 First I want to raise taxes on the very wealthy because few of them are really paying their share. 4 Second many members of the middle class are carrying an unfair tax burden so I'm asking for a tax cut for the middle class. 5 If I'm successful most of you in the middle class will be paying 10 percent fever in taxes next year though 6 some of you in the higher income group may see your taxes rise 7 a little. 8 The problem with the national income tax is that there are many loopholes in the current law which allow 9 a lot of people to avoid paying any taxes at all. 10 My additional plan is to replace the lost revenue with a national sales tax which is fairer because it applies to all people equally. 11 Third we have no money to finance health care reform and we've made plenty of progress in reducing pollution and meeting clean air standard. 12 Therefore I'm asking for 50 cent a gallon tax on gasoline which will result in great deal of people using public transportation and will create additional revenue.
