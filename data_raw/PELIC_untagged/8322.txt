I had worked as a social activities coordinator in the Public Relations Department of the Taipei city government before I came to the United States. Once I had to receive a highly significant foreign customer but I couldn't even understand what he wanted to express to me and I didn't know how to respond to him. At that time I promised myself that I would learn and speak English very well. Thus I have already studied English in Pittsburgh for 1 year.
