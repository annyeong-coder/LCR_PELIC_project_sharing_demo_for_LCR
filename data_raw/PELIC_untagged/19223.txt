My Job I used to work as a physical therapist in my home country. I enjoyed helping the patients I always adviced them to do some exercises at home. When I gave them any a new exercise I try to make it clearer and easier to understand. Also if the patient was a new and has some pain I try to get rid of any difficult exercise from the pegning. Even I do that some of the patients have a reluctant feel to do it. That is why some patients took long time with physical therapy to become normal and healthy.
