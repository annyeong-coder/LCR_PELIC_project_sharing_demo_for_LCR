Five years ago my family lived in my hometown. My brother graduated his university. I was a high school student. My grandparents lived in Seoul that is the capital of Korea. Grandparents are very healthy. Since then my brother and I have moved away. My brother has been in military service and I have been in the US. My grandparents have moved to my hometown. My hometown is also hometown of my grandparents. Grandmother has sicked more and more.
