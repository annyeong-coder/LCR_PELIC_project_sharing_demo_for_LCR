I used to go with my father anywhere he went to. When I came back from school I used to have lunch with my parents and talk to them about my school. I used to do my homework and study my lessons before I went out . I used to play football with my brothers and my friends. I used to go to bed and get up early. I did not use to have breakfast at my home and I used to walk to school by my feet . I used to live with my parents before I got married. Today I am living in Pittsburgh and studying in English language institute university . I always get up at 8 00 and have my breakfast before I go to school. I take bus from and to school although I have a car but there is not enough parking at university . Sometimes I have my lunch with my friends in university. In weekend I always take with family to mecums zee or park for the entertainment. As for my school I am taking five subjects in this semester and my teacher ANON_NAME_0 is teaching me three of these subjects. I usual finish school at 3. 50 P. M. And arrive in my home around 5. 00 P. M.
