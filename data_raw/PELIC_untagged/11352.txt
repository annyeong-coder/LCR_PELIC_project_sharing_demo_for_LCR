Mei ANON_NAME_0 is my good friend who is living in Hangzhou. We were classmates when we were in junior high school which had a best quality of education in our city. After graduating we entered the different high school then the different university. Howere we keep in touch with each other until now. She has gotten married since she graduated from university and she has a clever son whose age is 4 years old. Her husband is a professor of Chinese in Zhe ANON_NAME_1 University which is very famous in China. Last month we talked on MSN she told me that she would be able to come to the U. S with her husband in the near future because her husband who as a visiting scholar got a invitation from California University. I am so happy to hear this new.
