Five years ago my parents and I lived in SHUIXING Street. Since then we moved to FUQIAN Street. Then 2 years after I have been a high school student for 3 years. Since then I graduated from high school. My father has had a job in police station. My mother has stayed at home. She hired hour labor before we moved. Since then she has cleaned room by herself. And my father went swim in gym in the past. Since then he has run in the morning.
