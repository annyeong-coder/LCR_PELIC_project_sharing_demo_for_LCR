I am confused by the East Island status. It is an unsolved mystery to me. I thought they might have been made by some mysterious energy exclude our human beings when I was a little girl. I believed it could have been sculpted by s certain alien lives who had limited power. Or they might have been produced by some kind of god who had giant figure tocreature big stone status. When I grew up I knew my imagination was so weird and romantic. They are supposed tobe made by our human but not some non natural energy. All the legends about them had been made by the ancientpeople. Then those legends had been handed down from generation to generation. As a child I was immersed in these stories without any doubt. So sometimes the mysteries are just fake and unbelievable.
