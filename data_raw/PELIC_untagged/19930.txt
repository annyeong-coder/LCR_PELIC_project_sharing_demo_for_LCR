I am going tell you about an interesting experience when I ran out money. At that time I was an university student. The school tuition was an automatic deduction from the bank. I put on money on April but the school took the money just half of it. Because they divided into the spring semester and the autumn semester. The end of August I realized I spent lots of money at the summer vacation. I didn't have enough money to pay the autumn semester's tuition. Out of the blue I came up with an idea which is gambling to earn money. So I went to Pachinko to get money. Unfortunately I spent additional money instead of earning it. Eventually I asked my mother to borrow money.
