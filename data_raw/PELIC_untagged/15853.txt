There is a lot of experience I had had on the phone. I remember that day I received a call from person he told me that I won a prize. While he was taking about the place in which I can get my prize my kids turned on the TV so I asked him to hold on because I have to turn the TV down so I can hear him clearly. Before he hung up he gave me the address and tried to take me into to go to that place. Actually I didn't refuse but I told him that I will call him back after I talk it over with my husband. In fact I told my husband about that however he said that I shouldn't think it over also he asked me that I not pick up the phone when I see that number on the screen even he keeps up until he gives up because he had had this experience and he know that these people have another target from their call.
