I was born in small suburb which deemed to be one from the most beautiful place in my country. While I was living there I made a lot of good relationships. My childhood was wonderful. I remember one funny event while I was seven years old which I had forgotten my shoes in my house before going to the school. I had finished a high school at this suburb before I have transferred to the university to get a bachelor degree. When I was twelve years old I traveled to Paris with my family. We have been traveling to Paris since 1995. My father bought an apartment there while we were there. I have already decided to work there after getting master degree.
