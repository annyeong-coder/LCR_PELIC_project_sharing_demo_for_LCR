List Favorte sports baseball Favorite team Yankees Favorite player Chien Ming Wang I also play soft ball I love many kinds of sports especially baseball. For one thing I loved to watch MLB games on the television when I was in Taiwan. My favorite team of MLB is New York Yankees. There are many famous players in the team. They also had a lot of histories such as they got 26 World Series championships since 1901 and had a great player who is Babe Ruth etc. . . Another reason is that Chien Ming Wang is my favorite player who is a pitcher in Yankees. He won 38 wins in MLB in the past two years. He is one of the best pitchers in MLB during these years. I'll watch the game which is pitched by him when I finish this semester. Most importantly I love to play softball which is like baseball. I usually play with my colleagues every Saturday in Taiwan. My defenses position is left field in our team. Playing softball and watching baseball game can get a lot of fun in my life.
