I live in an old apartement. I did not look up for another one and I did not look over it because I did not have enough money. It was dirty and messy. I took away the old carbet but I kept on the cough. Then I straightened up the apartement to prepare it for my staff. After that I put up the clothes cabenet and I hang up the mirror. After that I picked up my clothes and put it in the cabenet.
