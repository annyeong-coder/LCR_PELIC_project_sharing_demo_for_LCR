I painted our house last summer. The job took about two weeks. First I washed the exterior using warm water and a mild detergent. Then I sealed all the chinks and pores in the walls with putty. After the putty had had a chance to dry I could painted the exterior. I used a latex paint because it is easy to apply and cleans up with water. I needed a whole week to finish this part of the job. I was very careful to apply the paint evenly because I did not want to have to apply two coats. I used a color that was very close to the original color. Our house is a two story house which meant that I needed a tall ladder to do the second story. I could had to balance the paint on the top rung of the ladder while I worked. When I finished the job I felt a great deal of satisfaction. I had to pat myself on the back. Even my dad said that I did a good job.
