First my name is Abdulrhman but my classmates call me Abdu. Then I'm interesting in play football with my friends. After that my hobbies are traveling reading and swimming. Next right now I'm thinking how to get a high score in IELTS exam. Then I always study hard for this exam and I hope achieve my goal. After that I'm going to apply for an university. Finally I'm happy to be in US.
