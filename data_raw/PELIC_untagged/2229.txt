I disagreed with this statement. I think that good luck is 50 of have success and the another 50 is competence. My point is if you are compete but you never have oportunite of show it you are not lucky person. Although if you are in the right pleace at the right time you are lucky. You can make to happen. So be successful is be in the right pleace at the right moment and have competence to realice it. Nevertheless to be a successful person you need to have competence and be luck to make your oportunites.
