To me I apply a good psyche a healthy diet a regular exercise to my life. In my opinion a good psyche is more important than anything else because there is one word in traditional Chinese medical science called Qi Shun the original meaning is to breathe fluently. Actually it is the similar to good psyche here. It means staying happy and keep a peaceful mind. Qi Shun could prevent any illness. I am a happy person so I strongly agree with that. A healthy diet is the easiest to apply to my life. Everyday I try to compenstae nutrition of diet. It involve vegetable meat fruit and nuts to stay healthy. In contrast a regular exercise is the most difficult because sometimes I am lazy and for some reasons I am not able to keep the regular exercise. When people turn to golden age they could take up a activity which they wanted to try but never tried so that have no regrets.
