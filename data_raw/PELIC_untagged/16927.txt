I think that it would harm the environment if tourists go to Ecuador often. It is true that the money that the tourists pay would help to improve the environment there but the electricity and the water the tourists use would definitly harm the envitonment. Also the tourists would bread the natural circle of the nature. The sympathize of the tourists would do no good to the nature.
