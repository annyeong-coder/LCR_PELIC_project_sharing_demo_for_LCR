She must know about something. She could have told me that. So I tried to make her spell out but she didn't say anything. Of course I don't have to hear this story from her. I should have asked to John first. He might have told me that. Otherwise They must have hidden something to me. However they should not have told to Tracy. She can't lie to me. Finally I know that john and mary are seeing each other since last week. I should tell this news to other friends. We could prepare a party for them.
