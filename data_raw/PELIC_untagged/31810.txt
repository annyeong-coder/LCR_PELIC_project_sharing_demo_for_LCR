From a time not long ago people was concern about buying online. People were wondering about whether that method of shopping is secure or not. Since then online shopping become more widespread and reliable but some people still afraid of buying online and they didn't trust in that method. I understand that because there are still a lot of scams and piracy in some online website. However a lot of people preferred to shop online instead of the different ways of shopping for many reasons such as shopping online can save time more convenient and reliable. First since most of us have a busy lifestyle and we mostly have a time for go shopping instead of spend a lot of time you can buy anything from the Internet. For example you can buy form the internet and you can stay at home studying doing your homework or doing other activity with your family. Life is too short to west it in shopping while you can do that online at your home. Second shopping online becomes more convenient these days. You can buy anything you want and it will deliver into your front door. You don't have to go out in a busy day and wait for hours in traffic or wait in a line or wait till the shop assistant is ready to help you with your purchases. You can do your shopping in minutes even if you are busy apart from saving time and avoiding crowds Finally it is true that some of online shopping websites are scam and because of that people still hesitating from buying online. However stop buying from the internet should never be the solution. Instead there are a lot of reliable website to buy from for example eBay is one of the most safer and popular shopping online website. EBay use a very safe method for both buyer and seller by using mediator website PayPal . In this way seller will not receive the item money until the buyer receive the item and make sure its matching the seller's description. Also they use a very high level of protection ways to protect the buyer and the seller. I believe that buying online is a very effective way for shopping and it became more development every day and people should trust it because buying online will save a lot time and money also it's easier and reliable.
