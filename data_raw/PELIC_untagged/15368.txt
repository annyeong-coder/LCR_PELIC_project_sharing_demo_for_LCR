South Korea is great country to visit. South Korea has three Oceans. Which are south east and west. The most beautiful ocean's call Tnchoen ocean is in the west area of South korea claimed by my classmate Hwasoo. The restaurants in South korea are abnormal because they open 24 hours a day and they have all kind of seafoods available there.
