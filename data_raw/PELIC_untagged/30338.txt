Now I'm living in my apartment that I rent it last September. In my apartment I have two bedrooms and big living room. In my living room I have big sofa that I usually take nap on it when I came from school. Also I have in the living room two windows that I can see the back yard of my building. The TV that I usually play video game in located in front of my sofa. In my bedroom I have two clothes storage which I can keep my clothes there. Also I have two windows which I can see my neighbors houses one is located in the north and the second one in the east. In my front door I have big mirror that I always look at my self before I go out. Also I have a table in my dinning room that I always eat my food their and study.
