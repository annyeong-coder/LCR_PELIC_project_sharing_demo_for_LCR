Coming out of the train station the tourists saw a boy selling guidebook. Noticing their interest in him the boy offered them a guidebook. They told the boy they couldn't buy anything not having any local money. Impressed by the boy's responsibility they decided to go back and buy a guidebook. Finding an exchange kiosk they changed some money. Having gotten some local money they looked for the boy but couldn't find him. After being told where the boy might be they located him. Having found the boy they bought a map from him.
