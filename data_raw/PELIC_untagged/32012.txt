Dear Cedric How have you been brother Well I hope I hadn't heard from you for long time. I've written this letter just to give you some news of me. As you know I have been In California to practice my hobby surfing as a full time job. If you read the sports magazines you probably knew I won the last major championship who occurred In july. But before I am going to that let's start from the beginning. Since I had decided to make it my professional career I had been working very hard. By the time I won this tournament I had been injured several times. This is the culmination of five years of work. Honestly surfing had changed my life I had experimented so many things that I am more self confident you might take a break come and see how great I have changed. In fact I really miss you I hope to see you soon Sincerely Roland.
