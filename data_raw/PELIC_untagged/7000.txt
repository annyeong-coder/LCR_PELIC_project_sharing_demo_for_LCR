Everyone wishes to live in a nice life and me too. We need enough money for the life. If we don't have money we can't live in a house buy the clothes and eat food because money is important thing in the world. People can't leave money for themselves. I wish I'll earn a lot of money. There are several reasons for me to earn money including the fact that I wish to enjoy life with my parents I want to have a big house to live in and I want to drive a nice car. First I wish to enjoy life with my parents. My parents didn't have enough money for me and my sister to study so they went other country to earn money. As a result of this reason I didn't live with my parents a long time so we didn't have enough time to enjoy our life. For example we didn't travel to nice places eat dinner in beautiful restaurant and go shopping together. For these reasons I want to have enough money to enjoy a fantastic life with my parents. Second I want to have a big house to live in. Actually I've never lived in a house. When I was in China I lived in my aunt's apartment. Now in the U. S. I still live in an apartment. Apartment is not bad but I want to change to a house to live in because houses have many benefits such as it have many rooms beautiful garden and enough parking places so I want to have a big and beautiful house. Last I want to drive a nice car. I like famous cars and I like to drive a car. I didn't drive a car when I lived in China but I always wanted to drive a car. Now I can drive in the U. S. I just got driver's license about 1 month ago so I need to drive carefully anytime. Later when my driving skills to improve I want to buy a nice and comfortable car. All these reasons for me are important. If I want to realize these reasons I need enough money to do that. I think most people in order to realize their wishes to earn money and work hard. Then you can enjoy your fantastic lives. Also me I want to strive for my life.
