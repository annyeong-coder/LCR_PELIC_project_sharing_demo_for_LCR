My older sister was a big help to me when I was a teenager. She got me to try new things and she even taught me to read holy Quran. She never laughed at my mistakes or made me feel sad. She helped me find the difficult words in holy Quran. She got me to read holy Quran fluently and clearly. She didn't let me read another.
