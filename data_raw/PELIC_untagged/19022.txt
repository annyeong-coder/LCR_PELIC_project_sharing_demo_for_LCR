I wish I could go to the moon. When I was a kid I have heard a Chinese traditional story. In the moon there had a rabbit a woman and a uncut tree. The woman was the most beautiful woman in China and her hosband who was the hero. Because the man shot the sun's sons so the sun was angry. The sun divided the couple. In Chines year I am a rabbit so I like rabbits. I believe the story sometimes I see the moon I can see a rabbit in the moon. Moon Festebal is our country's holiday and it is coming on October 3th. In the day the moon is round I wish I could go there . First I want to play with the rabbit and talk about the story with the woman. I hope she can bring me to see the Space and the Amostrong's vision of feet. We can take the boat or use her cloth to anywhere because the moon is close to the sun and the other stars. Then I want to try to cut the tree and I can become a hero in the world. I think I can enjoy the trip.
