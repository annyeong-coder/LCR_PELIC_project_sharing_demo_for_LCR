New York City sounds like a great place to study English because first New York is the one principal City in the United States. I think that the Universities and Institutions are so good and these offer a good plans for the students. In addition New York is a great city that you can find everything that you like but It is crucial that you have spend money because in some cases some things cost a lot and you have to find out how to pay silver. You are always going to look alternatives tends for examples punks hip hop rock etc. And it is interesting to know about these tends. Second if you are going to study in New York you can learn to speak quickly the language because you always stay with the people of the other countries that they don't speak your same language and the idea is that you practice English. The other alternative that you learn speak English is listening the conversations of peoples listen the radio watch TV and understand the meaning of every kind music. In conclusion I think that English is easy to learn but if you practice every time.
