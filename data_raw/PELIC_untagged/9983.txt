Hi. My name is Kevin Gin Last Name . I just graduated from high school. I came to the U. S. After I graduated. Also I have lived here for 5 months. At same time I am studying in the ELI. This is semester I am taking the Grammer and reading class. Also I have been working in restaurant since last December. I have a really busy life in here. In addition music is my second life. I can't live without it. I have to listen to music everyday. Because music can make me relax even though just one song. I liked Hip hop music and now I like Rock music. I always play music in my free time. I used to play in a school rock band. I so enjoyed that at that time. Of cause I play music here. I have played the guitar in Korean church for 2 months. I really like to play guitar there because you can get some nice Korean food and meet some good friends if you play guitar for them. What a nice deal.
