The NEO PI R is a questionnaire widely accepted as an objective way to describe someone's personality. People taking the survey can either rate themselves or someone they know well. The survey result can be used to generate a profile of a person based on 30 specific characteristics that fall under five larger categories. These five categories are neuroticism extraversion openness agreeableness and conscientiousness.
