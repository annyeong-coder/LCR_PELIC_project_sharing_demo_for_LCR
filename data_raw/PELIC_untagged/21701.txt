I had a summer vacation with my family in the Philippines 5 years ago. One of the most delicious meals that I ate for this vacation was the pineapple rice even though there were several good ones for us. Actually the Pineapple rice is from Thai. But it is not surprising fact because a lot of foods from a variety of countries coexist in the Philippine. Anyway when we began to be sick and tired with local foods it was savory enough to stimulate our appetite. A travel guide brought us to one of good sea food restaurants which are located near Manila bay when I complained about our problem about local meals. As the well known restaurant this one had a lot of travelers came from all over the world including many local peoples. This restaurant was providing living robsters and diverse fishes and shellfishes with Philippine's traditional foods. So for our dinner we chose one fish called lapulapu one robster and clams. In addition we ordered pineapple rice for our appetizer by the recommendation of restaurant manager. Contrary to our expectation this appetizer was great and awesome. Because the yellowish color and the smell of pineapples were perfectly in accordance with diverse green and red vegetables it looked like beautiful jewelry which was put on the table. Besides that the taste was delicious and it was enough to encourage us to enjoy the next food. Even now when I am thinking of this food it makes my mouth water. Furthermore I think that the taste of this exotic food will be loved by both the western and asian peoples.
