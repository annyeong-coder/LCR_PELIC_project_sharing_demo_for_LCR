Last year I went to London where I spent some months. I left my country alone and I moved to learn English I decided that London could be the right place to start to learn English but at the end I changed my opinion. London Is a metropolis with too many people and I met only a few people that was really grow up in this city. Most of the people was speaking really a bed English of course better then mine but absolutely no the proper end correct English. London is a busy city the people every time run everywhere and anybody have times for you. If you are not be able to understand and answer immediately you are lost nobody help you or try to understand. At the end of my time in this city my English was not improved enough but to be honest I had a lot of fun.
