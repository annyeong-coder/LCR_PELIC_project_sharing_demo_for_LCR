22 03 07 Dear ANON_NAME_0 I recently looked for TVs for us. Here's some information I gathered about TVs for choosing which is we are interesting about. There are Sony and Sharp. Sharp TV is more expensive than Sony TV. Sharp costs 2799. 99 But Sony only costs 2399. 99 So we'll save extra money. However Sony TV is bigger than Sharp TV. Sony has a 50 inch screen but Sharp TV has only a 40 inch screen. You know we have a big living room so the Sony TV is better than the Sharp TV. Both their screens are LCD. In addition Sony TV is newer designed than Sharp TV. Also Sony TV is weightier than Sharp TV so Sony is easier to moving in the house than Sharp TV. I know you're looking for which one is longer warranty. Anyway Sony TV has a longer warranty than Sharp TV. Sony TV has 5 years and Sharp TV has only 3 years. In addition if we buy the Sony TV we will get shipping free. I think the Sony TV is a good choosing. Anyway let me know which one you prefer. Thanks
