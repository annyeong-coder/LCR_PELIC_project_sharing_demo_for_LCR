When I was in college I played Taekwondo for a year in the central area of saudi arabia but I couldn't continue playing because I had a lot of exams in college . It was interesting sport so I'm still love it. First I start as a beginner and I focused on tricks for self defense . After that I spent 3 months in playing it . Then I got yellow belt so I felt happy for that. After that I was hesitated either I continue playing Taekwondo or I change to Karate . Then I decided to continue Playing it. Finally I continued and I got blue belt. I still have blue belt In Taekwondo and I recently played Karate because it was the only self defense sport available in my location.
