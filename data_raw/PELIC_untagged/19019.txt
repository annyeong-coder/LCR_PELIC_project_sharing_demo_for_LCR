If I were so rich and I could travel anywhere no matter how much the trip would cost me. I would choose Italy since it has many beautiful cities and gorgeous landscapes. Italy is the country of history art and fashion. In Italy there are a lot of things to do and a lot of places to visit. Every city in Italy has historical and invalubale places. For example in Rome there are the Colosseum the Vatican city and the Trevi fountain where you can throw a coin and make a wish to come back to Italy again. In Venice you can enjoy eating a homemade Italian pizza in a small cafe over ther river. Then you can go for shopping in Milan. Last but not least you can enjoy the fascinating archtiture in Florance where the city is full with the red roof houses. For all these reasons Italy is my best Place.
