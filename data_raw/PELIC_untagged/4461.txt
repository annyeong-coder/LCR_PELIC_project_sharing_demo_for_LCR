Planning a weekend trip to another city needs five common steps. First preparing the budget is the most important step for any trip. For instance we make a list for all the possible expenses that we have in our trip. Then finding an appropriate place for resident should be done from the beginning such as making reservation for hotel online. In fact we make our choice of the hotels based on our trip budget. After that the car has to be checked. Especially we check the fuel the oil and the wheels. Next we get maps and tourist guider. At this point we organize schedule about the activities that we are going to do in these three days. Finally we strap our bags and put them on the car to start the trip.
