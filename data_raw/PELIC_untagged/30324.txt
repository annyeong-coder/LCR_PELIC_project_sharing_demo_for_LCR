I live in an apartment which has two rooms in it. My room is bigger than the other room. I have a table that I use it to study. Also I have a queen bed which is taking a huge space in the room. In front of my bed there is a big closet where I put my clothes in it. In the left side of my bed there are three windows that I bring the sun light into my room. In the backside of my room there is the wall where I used to put a lot of posters of a movie stars. When I woke up I went to the bathroom which is in the left side of my bed. My friend who lives with me has the small room in the apartment so he do not feel happy.
