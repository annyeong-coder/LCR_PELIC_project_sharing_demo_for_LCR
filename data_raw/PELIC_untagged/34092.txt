The most useful skills I have learned In Writing 3 are the processes of writing. From pre writing to write a complete essay I can learn sentence structural and paragraph structural. In pre writing I learn how to think more and more detail about the topic. It is useful because I have to check vocabulary during thinking about detail. In paragraph structural I learn how to write a complete article step by step. It have to use supporting ideal to support the sentence. I did not about this before. Second useful skill for me is knowing dependent and independent sentence. They can make sentence more complete and clear.
