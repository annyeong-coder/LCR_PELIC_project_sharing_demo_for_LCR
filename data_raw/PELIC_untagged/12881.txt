This story is about America's new merchants of death tobacco companies. They encourage young people to begin to smoke through their advertising. They want to attract young people because they are new customers and most smokers start to smoke from early ages between ages 12 and 16. This article says that cigarette advertising creates an environment in which young people are more likely to smoke. Accordingly tobacco companies advertise in all the ways. They do indirectly as well as directly. They use the way brand stretching which means advertising nontobacco products and services named after their brands. In addition they advertise more insidiously through joining sports sponsorship. I am opposed to the insidious strategies of tobacco companies. I know that tobacco is kinds of one's tasty and everyone has a right to smoke although it is harmful. Besides tobacco can advertise their product too. However they give young people much exaggerated images through their advertisements. Such an advertisement makes young people focus on a good image not on tobacco itself. Eventually young people can make a wrong decision about whether they begin to smoke or not.
