I will tell you a mystery which is unsolved. When I got home yesterday I noticed that my bag had become lighter. I checked inside of my bag and most of my texts dissapeared. At first I thought that they had been stolen. However the bag had been being attached on my back. Were they left somewhere by me Were they dropped somewhere by me Were they thrown away by me The answers to these questions are all No. I had to have them searched so I called police. However my offer was rejected. Actually they haven't been found yet. I'm still made anxious by this incident.
