Do not disclose too much personal information that I think is valuable. Although making a friend needs sincere you still need to protect yourself. Online dating is not the same as that you go out with a person. You do not know the person is a friendly man or villain. Although you may feel how he she is suitable to you you still cannot ensure authenticity of all information from the person therefore you cannot believe that person. Revealing too much personal information pushes you into a dangerous situation. For example if you give that person your phone number he she may call you several times during a day or whole week. Moreover if you disclose your address he she may follow you to your home. It is hazardous if others know where your home is. Hence keeping some important information about you is crucial. Do give someone the chance to impress you that I do not think is valuable. When you talk with that person online you perceive that person is not proper to you. I think you do not need to give him her another chance because you may feel waste time to talk with him her in the second time. For example his her manner of speaking may not match your type or there are no any interesting themes between you. Consequently you should consider giving him her a second chance carefully.
