Dear Sally First of all thank you for everything you have done for us. Truthfully it is kind of sad that the semester is almost over. Attending the classes at the ELI let me assess about a lot of important things which I had almost forgotten. I felt the values of time and started evaluating that I was wasting my precious time for being homesick. Therefore I am happy that I could get over with my weakness and I am definitely ready to move on. I am planning to attend for the next semester at the ELI to enhance and strengthen my English skill which will be helpful for finding a good job in the future. Actually I have a month break until next semester so I am planning to go to Mongolia to visit my family. On the way coming back to the States I will stop by Japan and Korea for a couple of days. However before going to Mongolia which is Aug 2 I will participate in an autograph session of minor baseball team in Florida. The reason why I am going to Florida is a friend of mine who is a former minor league baseball player from Chicago Cubs established an organization to search for missing children. The Aug 2 event is the very first activity will be held by Bair find organization. Even though I will be traveling I will try to make time to review what I have acquired through this semester. Those are in my agenda during the break until next semester. How about you Sally Please let me know about your plans over the break. Sincerely ANON_NAME_0
