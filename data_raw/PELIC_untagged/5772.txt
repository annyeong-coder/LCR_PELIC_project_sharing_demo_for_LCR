I want to mention some first events in my life. Before 1997 I had never worked for government in Turkey. Before I had a car in 2000 I had not learned how to drive. Before I went to China in 2007 I had never eaten Chinese food and sushi. Before I came to Pittsburgh I had never been in the US. Before I came to the US I had never flown for 11 hours. Before I moved here I had never seen the Three Rivers Art Festival. Before I came to the US I had learned human's life teems with interesting exciting and fascinating events.
