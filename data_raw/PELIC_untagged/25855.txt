Success in every profession requires many skills and qualifications. For example my profession as a teacher assistant in university need many skills to reach a high position job because I deal with my managers colleagues and students. In order to achieve my goals I have to develop my academic technical and communication skills. Improving myself academically is a very crucial aspect in my profession. I have to complete my graduate studies by getting my master and Ph. D. In order to gain knowledge and to be expert in my field. However a high position job will not be achieved unless if I have a Ph. D. Developing my academic skills will make me a well educated person and ensure a high position job for me. In addition to academic skills technical ones is required too. We use technology in many aspects of life. As a teacher I use computer Internet and language lab in teaching. I prepare my lesson in computer and present it to my students by using PowerPoint slides presentation. Also I keep in touch with them via my e mail. Using language lab is complicated an needs a special skill to deal with its devices. Actually improving myself technically will guarantee having the needed skill to deal with technology correctly.
