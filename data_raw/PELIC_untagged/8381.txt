Trash classification was a big issue in Taiwan around 7 years ago. Before Taiwanese government started to force people to classify waste and recyle it dealing with everyday trash was a severe problem. The government often had to find new appropriate places to bury trash and build new incinerators. However because Taiwan is a small island and people do not accept any trash operating structures near their houses every time when the land was announced for burying trash that always caused a lot of people to protest. Therefore the government made a law to ask the public to classify their wastes. Although in the beginning of conducting the policy Taiwanese government encountered strong opposition consequently people have agreed with the importance of classifying trash. This recycling policy not only solves the problem of dealing with a huge amount of everyday trash but also conserved numerous resources. Almost all of the trash can be recycled until now. Only is a little amount of trash burned or destroyed. Moreover people have to pay more money for their trash so they have changed the ways of using resources. For instance when they buy goods they will consider their materials if they can be recycled or not.
