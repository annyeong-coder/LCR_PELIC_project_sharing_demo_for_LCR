Success The word success has a lot of definitions. Many people think that success is related to relationships career or money. Other people say it is about prizes and awards. Some books have other meanings for success such as reaching goals a perfect event or good luck in life. In my opinion success is a very big word no one can get specific meaning for it. Success in my definition is to get what you plan for. For example I planed for a scholarship and after ten years I got it. However my friend says it's achieving a goal such as pursuing a degree in another country. On the other hand my wife says in order to feel great you must work for your goals. For instance she felt so great when she finished her Bachelor's degree because she was the only one in her family that achieved this. According to my mother success is getting married and starting a family. All these thoughts from friends family and others are not the same. I think the difference is how we understand success. My friends felt that when I got my scholarship it was a success but for me the big success will be when my I earn my Phd degree.
