Before I came to Pittsburgh I used to work fife days in the week. Also I used to visit my family bi weekly at least. Usually I used to drive my car to any place. In fact I didn't use to walk more than ten minutes. Now I study four days in the week. The buses are my transportation media. Sometime I walk more than a half hour. Unfortunately I can't visit my family as before. Finally all things at this time should be changed different as I used to be them before.
