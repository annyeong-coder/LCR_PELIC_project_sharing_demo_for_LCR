Optimism sometimes leads to failure. To be a optimism anything what they see and think are optimistic. So they might ignore some deeper problems. They always believes that everythings are possible even though it is neer to fail. Maybe someday they can't bear a huge attack then never be able to recover. So in my opinion to be a impartial is the best way to face to the world.
