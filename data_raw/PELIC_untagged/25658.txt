Saving endangered animals The environment faces a couple of critical issues such as global warming and animal hunting. Animal hunting leads to much danger. One of the bad impact of hunting is reducing and dying out some rare animals. Animals' right should establish many organizations which care of animals because plenty of people have a little recognition about value of animals. A great many procedures should be done to prevent hunting such as command penalty for most frying cases. Also animals should be collected in a lot of protected areas. Hiring people to watch all rare animals and any hunters may help. Using many cameras to observe the animals because there is a great deal of frying will keep some animals alive.
