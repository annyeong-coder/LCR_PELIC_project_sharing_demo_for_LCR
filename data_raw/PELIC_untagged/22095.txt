My country Japan is located in East Asia and is composed of four major islands. There are two cities Hiroshima and Nagasaki which were destroyed by Atomic Bombs in 1945. Hiroshima is located west of the main island and the first Atomic Bomb City in the world in where I was born grew up and lived after getting marriage too. The center of the city was entirely burned and destroyed completely and a lot of people were killed injured and burnt by the powerful blast and radiation. It is said that many people are being suffered from various illnesses caused by atomic bomb radiation still now. After the city was recovered very quickly the Peace Park was constructed in the epicenter for the purpose of praying the victims and appealing human peace and world peace to the world. The only wreckage the Atomic Bomb Memorial Dome is designated one of world heritage sites in Japan. The story about bombing has been kept telling to next generations and visitors from every country. Very delicious and traditional Hiroshima style pan cakes which include variety of vegetables meat and seafood are served in the restaurants. Another tiny beautiful island Miyajima is also registered a world heritage site which is located on calm inland sea in Hiroshima.
