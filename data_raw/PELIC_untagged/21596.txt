In my family there are six people my father my mother a older sister two younger brothers and me. My parents always made me be an honest helpful and friendly person. They are like that and enjoy assiting people in any situation. When I was a child my parents made me donate a toy to a poor child each month. I also had to be honest with my parents about everything. For example my grades. Also my brothers were always breaking things and I was always fixing them. So I am a person that likes to do something good to help people
