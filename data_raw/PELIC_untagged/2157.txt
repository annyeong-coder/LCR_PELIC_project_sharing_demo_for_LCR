Yesterday I went to the restaurant with couple of my friends. While we were there I have witnessed a crime. My friends and I were just starting our dinner. Then two men came from outside pointing out there weapons to the face of the cashier in the restaurant. It was a shocking moment for us. Everybody in the place was scared. The manager of the restaurant was trying to activate the alarm system in the place. But unfortunately they discovered him. Accidentally there was a police car passing around the restaurant. Finally they caught the bad guys.
