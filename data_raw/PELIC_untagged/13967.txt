Dear members I know that some of you are discourages because it is taking you so long to run five miles. However don't give up yet. Usually it is hard to run five miles at first year but it will get better if you continue that. Here is a good example one runner run 5 miles for 45 minutes in the first year. However it took him only 34 minutes in the second year. His time decreased for the last 7 year. Also in the seventh year it took him 31 minutes to run 5 miles. Keep running! You will be able to run faster.
