It's no doubt that summer is the best season for travel. Especially in summer vacation thousands and thousands people are out of towns out of cities to travel. Meanwhile you spend more for paying the ticket the restaurant and the hotel in this touring busy season. I would like to make an economical trip in slack season such as Spring and Fall. In slack season you can make your travel economical you still can make your travel educational and fun. I plan to Chicago in the coming Spring. First of all I do some works on internet like searching information about the city finding round trip cheap ticket and cheap hotel. Next I make a tour schedule. No trip to Chicago is complete without visiting its Fine Science and Industry museums. So I plan to go to museum and to immerse myself in natural history in the first day The following days I will go to Sears Tower Skydeck with an overview of the city I will explore Navy Pier and take a tour ship to cruise around Michigan I will tour on foot to discovery a park and take a free tour bus to cruise around the center of the city I will go to Chinatown and Mexican restaurant for delicious meal. Wherever I go window shopping will be my favorite thing. I think that impulse shopping may be not good for you economical trip. Finally I make a exact trip schedule then book the ticket and order a hotel on internet.
