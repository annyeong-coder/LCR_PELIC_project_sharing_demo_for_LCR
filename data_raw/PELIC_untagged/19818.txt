Gone with the Wind directed by Victor Fleming and written by Margaret Mitchell is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I remembered the first time I saw the movie was in 1988 when I was a freshman in a university in China. I was moved by the tragedy romance story. It had a strong influence on my later life. The movie described the time during American Civil War and Reconstruction periods how most people straggled and survived at that hard time. Scarlett O'Hara a Southern beauty from a wealthy family was a self centered and a strong willed female. She always had endless hope in her heart. No matter how hard life was she could find her way to deal with it. Rhett loved Scarlett very mush was a rebellious profiteer. However Scarlet's love with her first sight lover named Ashley Wilkes doomed the marriage between her and Rhett failed at last. Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable featuring Scarlett and Rhett are on my favorite actors and actresses' list. The movie received ten Academic Rewards is considered as the greatest and most popular film in all the time. Vivien was awarded the best actress. At the end of the movie Scarlett said Tomorrow is another day left the hope and imagination for the audience.
