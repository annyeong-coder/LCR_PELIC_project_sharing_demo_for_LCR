Now I am living with my host family so I'll talk about my home stay's room below. First I like my room. The size is as big as my room in Japan. Although it's not so big I feel very comfortable because if it was big I think I would not settle in. The wall is warm light green color and it cheers me up. There is a window in front of my desk. So if it's sunny I can see over yards well while I study. I use a full length mirror every morning before I go out. It's useful to check on my figure. But closet door doesn't close. So I'd like to fix it up. In addition since I brought too many clothes I can't hang up all of my clothes. So I want to pick a drawer up. I sometimes see flies in my room even though I close the window. I want to figure out where they come from. My room is a little messy so I'm going to clean up from now on.
