My name is Daniel Last Name I am 33 years old. I am chemist. I am here because I have to learn English because I need to improve my English. I am studying to take the TOEFL test because I want to apply a doctorate at university of Pittsburgh at School of medicine in the area of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetic. Recently I am studying in the ELI of the University of Pittsburgh and I am practicing with some friends speaking English and at night I am watching on TV to educate my hear. Since I began at ELI I feel that I have improved my level in English and I hope to follow advancing in my goal. I like the American music and I hear American rock almost every day. I like to do workout and since tomorrow I am going to go the gym I like to lift weight.
