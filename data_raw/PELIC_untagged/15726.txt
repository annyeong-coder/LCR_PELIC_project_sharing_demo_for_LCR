First of all I do not believe those kinds of people according to my religion there is no body can know about something invisible or conceal something. So if I missed something or someone I would prefer to pray to our God to help me for that thing. On the other hand depending on this kind of people means that we have a lack in our mind how can we believe the person who is claiming something like that although he can not find what does he miss. It is opportunity to help him self before helping us. Consequently we reached high class in education and literature to help us to find out a good way for thinking which one can we believe and which one we can't.
