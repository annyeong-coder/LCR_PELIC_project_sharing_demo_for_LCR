The students require to give up electronic devices which are cell phone and laptops. I agree with allowed the rule during the semester. Because I think the rules are important to focus on self denial and we need absorbed in class. But mostly I am using a lot of electronic devices in a daily life. So I would feel inconvenience not having cell phone and laptops.
