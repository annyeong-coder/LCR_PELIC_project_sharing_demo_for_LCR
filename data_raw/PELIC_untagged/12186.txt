I have a younger sister. We was born in Korea and grown up together. All surroundings are the same. Although we have the same parents we are different in many ways. The first thing we have physical similarities and differences. Our faces look like each other. However my sister takes after father more than mother I take after mother more than father. Generally speaking both are tall but I am taller than my sister. Next we are thin but I have fatter than sister. The second thing we have emotional similarities and differences. Whereas my sister is extroversive I am introspective. I'm not sure but it is certain that she is more extroversive than I. Then both have hobby but this is also different. Although her hobby is driving her car my hobby is working out in the gym. We like learning something. However my sister like learning skills I like learning languages. In conclusion in spite of having several similarities we have several differences like appearance personality hobby and favorite.
