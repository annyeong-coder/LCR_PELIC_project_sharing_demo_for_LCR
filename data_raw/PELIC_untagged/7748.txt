I am going to write about my best friend. Her name is HANIFE. I met Hanife while I was living in Pittsburgh. That was one year a go. I met her while I was together with my other friends. We were preparing food for the Turkish Food Festival when she came to help us. While we were talking I learned a lot of things about her. She had just arrived in Pittsburgh. She and her family stayed at my friend's home. They had come to Pittsburgh for just two years. And than they would go back to Turkey. I enjoyed her while I was speaking with her. I heard two or three weeks later her family moved to my neighborhood and we were neighbors. What a good luck for me!
