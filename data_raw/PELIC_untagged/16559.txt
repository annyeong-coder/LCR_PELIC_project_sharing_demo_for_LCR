I usually wake up at 7 30am. I cook breakfast on myself everyday such as a loaf or bread milk and eggs. I take classes in the ELI from Monday to Friday. I love to attend a grammar classes because I am interested in learning English grammar. I am speaking English when I take classes. I am typing the sentences right now. I think my English ability is not good at now but I will do best.
