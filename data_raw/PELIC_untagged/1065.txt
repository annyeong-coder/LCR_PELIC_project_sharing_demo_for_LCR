Mike I think that we should bring the water. Joe I agree with you. Mike Other things are a blanket and bowl. Joe Basically I agree with you. We need blanket because we should keep our body warm while we are sleeping. But I could not understand a bowl . Why do you think that you should bring a bowl to a desert island It might not be necessary. Mike The bowl is very useful because it will be used for taking water from river or rain and we can cook something use a bowl. Joe OK. But I think you should bring a pan or pot to do that.
