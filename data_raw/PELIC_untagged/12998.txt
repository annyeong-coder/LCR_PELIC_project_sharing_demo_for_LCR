I was born in city named Alriaiyna in Libya in 1970. I had my education in this city. In 1993 I got my BA. I taught in this city about seven years from 1993 to 2000. Then in 2001 I began to study for my master's degree. My supervisor's name is ANON_NAME_0 he was very friendly with me. I had my master's degree and new good job at University of Aljabel Algharbi. In 2005 I became head of department of geography. In 2007 I got scholarship to complete my PhD degree in the US. Now I am studying English language at the ELI at university of Pittsburgh.
