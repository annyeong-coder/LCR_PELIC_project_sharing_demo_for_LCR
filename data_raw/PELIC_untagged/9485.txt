I think make a specific profile is very important. Because you want people to know more about you so a detailed profile is necessary. No one will be interested in a profile which only has a little words. Another advice that I agree with is spending more time to know someone. Because a lot of people have the shy personality. At the first chatting he or she may will get tense. You know when people get nervous they usually do someting or say some words are stupid. That probably will annoy whom he or she is talking to. Geving him or her the second chance is the right way to find out more about him or her.
