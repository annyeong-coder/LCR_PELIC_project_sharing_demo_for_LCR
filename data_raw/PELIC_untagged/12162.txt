The Similarities and the Differences Between Cultures Last year I came to the US and from the first step in the Detroit airport I noticed many differences and similarities in the clothes and the food between her and which I had in my country. To show these similarities and differences I wrote this essay. First of all in the cold weather the men here almost wear the same style which men usually wear in my country but all the women here have very different categories of wearing to the women in my country. In my country the women always wear a long and more convenient clothes to the body. In addition in the hot weather the people here are wearing by fferents in the clothes are very obvious I hope you learned some similarities and differences about the cultures in my country and in the Us.
