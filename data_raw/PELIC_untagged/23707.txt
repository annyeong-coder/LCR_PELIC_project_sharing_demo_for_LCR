last Saturday I was really bored. If came back in time were an option I would have stayed at home. I decided to go to see a movie. I wish the bus had not been so crowed. If only I had a car. It was raining so a arrived late. If I had taken the bus early I would not have been late. To make things worse I forgot my wallet.
