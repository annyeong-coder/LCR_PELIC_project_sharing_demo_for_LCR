I should have studied English when I was student. I could have studied Chinese too. Or I might have studied Spanish. I didn't have to study math so hardly because it's not useful in my job. If I studied foreign languages I could go abroad for work. I always say to my daughter that she should study foreign languages earlier. If so she can't be dumb in foreign countries. My husband speaks English very well. He must have studied hard English. I must focus on studying English while I am in the US.
