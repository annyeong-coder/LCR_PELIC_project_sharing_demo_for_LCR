Two weeks ago I read story which talked about the birth of star. The main characters in this story whom acted the most events were an astronomer and his wife. The place where he was worked is for monitoring the stars by using some specific data. He realized that seeing the star is easy but the most difficult thing is watching the star at the first impression. Therefore he was tired and disappointed. His wife was pregnant. His wife who knew everything about him knew that he worked very hard. The wife was concerned about their baby. She said that the baby who was inside her wanted to came out. He started caring about his baby the new star . At the end they tried to find out name of their baby. He chose Stella for their baby.
