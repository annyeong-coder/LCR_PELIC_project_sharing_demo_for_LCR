I remember spending time with my best friend who comes to my house nearly every week near the river behind my house as a child. We bought firecrackers and launched them towards the river. The firecrackers we bought the kind that launch into the air and explode were from a local convenience store. I remember we would hold the firecracker till the very last second and let it go before it exploded. I remember an incident where I was holding the firecracker and the fire sparked up my sleeve and into my arm pit. Although I wasn't burnt it scared me a bit. Yet it did not scare me enough to stop me from continuing to play.
