The movie consists of many chapters however I am going to discuss only first chapter and half of second chapter. The first chapter was talking about hiding Jewish and took place in 1941 in Nazi occupied France. Perrier LaPadite who was a father of the LaPadite family was making loggings when the Nazi SS troops came commanded by Colonel Hans Landa. Colonel Hans Landa asked permission from Perrier to get inside his house then he met members of LaPadite family. He told Perrier to use English instead of French and also he was explaining about his existence to find those hiding Jewish. He began asking question about Jewish family called Dreyfus . Perrier replied that there was a rumor that they had escaped. However Colonel Landa was to confirm how many Dreyfus family member were. After that he talked about himself and his job that a person or people who helped Jewish would be punished. This made Perrier told Colonel Landa that there were Jewish hiding in his house. Afterward the SS soldiers came and killed however there was one survivor called Shosanna who intentionally ran away. The second chapter was called The Basterds . It introduced the eight members of Jewish American soldiers leaded by Lieutenant Aldo Raine. Their tasks were to kill Nazis by dressed like civilians and infiltrated behind German front line. Lieutenant Raine also commanded his team to compensate him by taken one hundred Nazi's soldier head skin.
