A dream vacation can mean many things to me and I love to explore a lot of places. I've been very lucky I've always wanted to go to U. S. A. For a vacation and then I came here so I've to look for a new dream vacation. My dream vacation now would be to Europe. I have not had the opportunity to go there. Hwovere I'am going to go to Europe next summer. I'am looking to have a long tour of Europe with my family but that would be extremly expensive. I'ev traveled to Turky but I want to go to England Italy France Spain Germany and Grece. All those are very nice and great countries. Finally I wish that I can visit Eourpe because I want to discover this continent knowing people and learning from different cultures.
