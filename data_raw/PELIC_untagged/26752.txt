I met my friend Sara while I was studying in the ELI. She was walked when I asked her about the class G 85. While I was taking Michigan test She was taking same test. In the first semester I was sitting in the class when she came late. When the class She was asking me to show her what we are taking in the first class. Now I miss Sara because all of us in different class.
