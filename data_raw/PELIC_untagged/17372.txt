I have been here since octomber 2008 I had an apartment at centre avenue when I took my apartment I had to figure out how to fix up my room but while I came back home I tried to take away the TV and sofa. Sometimes I think up to change an apartment also I did up the wall by myself. I addition I brought about my living room like some chaires and dishes. In my opinion I fell for my apartment.
