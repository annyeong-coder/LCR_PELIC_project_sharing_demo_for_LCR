I really like listening to music. Music makes me be happy and interested and Music is one of my good friends. When I play computer I listen to music by music internet site. When I was young I prepared to sing. But now I usually listen to every kind of music such as balad jazz and pop song. I prefer to old music than late. My favorite kind of music is pop song and balad. I make a point of listening music in the morning. Because the music makes me felling is happy all day. When I was in Korea I always listened to music in the morning before I didn't wake up until I wake up. That was with a view to improving my English skill. Also I spend about one hour in listening to music. Sometimes I have trouble in listening to pop song because I can't understand the word. But I look forward to can understand all pop song music.
