I have read the quote by Diane Arbus. I think it means that Arbus wants to visit new places. Yes I do feel the same way. I have visited in some countries over Europe. The countries I have visited are Holland Switzerland France Italy and Turkey. I have never been in China Thailand Japan Australia Greek and Cyprus. I would like to go visit in those places some day. I have read and heard that Greek and Cyprus are very beautiful so I think this the two placeless I will visit first. I also have never been in the US west coast on the other hand sense I am here I think first I will visit the US west coast.
