Lumphun where I grew up is small city on the north of Thailand. I have a small house which my grandfather died in five years ago. I and my brother are very like the summer when we have Songkran day that is Thai New year. We can went out to ANON_NAME_0 Mung aat Chang mai where we splash water a lot of people at there it was very fun and happy. When I was 20 years old my family moved to a new house where we sell furniture is biger than the old house. My house has three rooms my room where I slept with my youngerbrother is near the kitchend. We loved to do homework on the bed which we slept in.
