It is a story that ridicules the Sunday school and the society. There is a little boy named Jim who did a lot of cheating and rascality without any retributions or punishments such as filling up the vessel with jar to cheat his mother stealing neighbor's apples and stealing his teacher's penknife and imputing to the moral boy. He never felt sinful and wanted to repent. It was also strange that he could boat and fish on stormy Sunday without been drowned what can punish him or let him repent. He married raised a large family even got wealthy and been respected universally by all manner of cheating and rascality. In the conclusion Jim had such a streak luck and charmed life unlike the bad James in the Sunday school books.
