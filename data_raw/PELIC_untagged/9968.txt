I have many methodes to learn English by funny. First you have to read a something. News and books is good material. Second you have to write practice. If you write your diary your write abillity is going up. Third you have to speak practice. Everyday do speak practice with someone. Fourth you have to listen practice. Radio is help to your listenning abillity. Fifth you have to study grammar. Grammar is very difficult and important subject. Sixth You have to invest much time. Something to learnning is very difficult so don't frustrate and have to patient. Without try you don't get anything. You can do use English very well.
