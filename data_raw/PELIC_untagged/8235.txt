I reserved a hotel two weeks ago. I chose wrong type of room so I needed to change. I wrote my quotations to ask and practiced my English some times. I also had requested a favor of my friend to call. Afterwards I called reception to renew information by myself. I had been worrying about my poor English. Finally when I arrived in the hotel I found the room was correct. Actually I order it successfully.
