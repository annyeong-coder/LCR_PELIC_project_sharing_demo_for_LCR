I these days the style of education has been changing. Online learning is one of examples of new educational styles. Although online learning is new style it has both differences and similarities with traditional classroom learning. Time schedule the environment and fruits are different between them. On the other hand contexts and goals are similar between them. Most people think traditional classroom learning is better than online learning in many aspects. However since we have many options of learning we should take advantages of those choices. I recommend that people should choose right styles for them in order to enhance our knowledge or skills effectively.
