Yesterday I've read the news that a woman killed her neighbor's cat cruelly. I was surprised at the news. There's a CCTV that captured her brutal act on tape. I watched that video. I was so shocked that I almost fainted. She looked crazy. She became intoxicated and acted very aggressive at a cat. I felt sorry for a dead cat. I hope that this doesn't happen again. That woman is accused of her act from many people. The cat owner went to law against her.
