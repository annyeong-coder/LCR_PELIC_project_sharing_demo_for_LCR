Life is good to live especially when you have interesting things to do during your free time. Listening to the music and writing some small songs are my favorite pass time. One of my favorite pass time is to listen to the music. Music is something that makes me relax and helps me to think ahead. Fore example the rhythm of some soul music create a perfect image of what the live should be. In addition Some type musics and well written such as slow classics soul etc bring some answers at certain of my questions or help me to see clearly my life. Music makes me dreaming about the world. For example how can we change the men mentalities and bring peace to everybody. The other favorite things I do to spend my free time is to write some small songs on the piece of paper. This the way for me to make my brain work. Because I feel myself inspiring by the nature. Writing small songs and find some melodies and rhythms is the way for me to feel free and to open out. Because I try to find my way to express the world's problem and how to solve them. Listening to the music and writing some songs are my favorite ways to spend my free time because it allow me to see the world at the other hands and his problem also to feel intense emotions of the everyday life.
