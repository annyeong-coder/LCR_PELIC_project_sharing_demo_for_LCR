With my personal experience I think pets are good friends in people's life. I had a cat named Mimi when I was young. I used to play with Mimi without my girl friends. I liked to do several things with Mimi. The first I usually gave her food three times each day because she disliked others to take care her except me. The second I walked with her around my backyard in the afternoon. She was great player in football. In addition she was a good listener. For instance when I was upset and I didn't want to talk with anybody she always sat beside to me and listened to my complaints. I thought that she was my best soul mate. Finally I want to say that pets are very kindly to human. Also Mimi was gorgeous model when I took some photos for her. She posed as a professional when I got her. Finally I'd like to say Mimi slept with me at night.
