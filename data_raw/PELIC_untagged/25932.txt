Soul mates are people whom we recognize from the first sight so we feel like we know them for a long time. Most people spend their lives searching for the perfect companions and definitely I am one of them. I was looking for someone who is sensitive romantic and responsible. Surprisingly I did not realize that my future soul mate was someone who was very close to me. That was one moment which forever changed my life. Now my soul mate is someone who can read my thoughts before I tell a word. He is someone whose heart is kind and he loves me for who I am.
