Do you know what happened to me the first time I saw snow I never realize what I did at the time unless my English tutor Danielle told me about it. Let me tell you my embarrass experience. I came to Pittsburgh two years ago. Although I came from a country where winter doesn't exist and I knew that I will see it here. One day I went to Literacy Council to study English. When the class ended Danielle said Look. It is snowing. She pointed to the window and all of the students turned around. Nothing happened that day except everybody stopped for a while and saw the snow through the window. Two days later there were a conversation among Danielle Alex another tutor and me. Danielle said You are so funny and very expressive Dewi. I will never forget your reaction yesterday. And Alex asked her what happened. What made me shocked was her explanation. She said She went to the window put her hands on it and pinned up her face on window. Then she demonstrated what I did the day before. She continued her explanation by saying I never saw people react like that. It was really funny. I still can draw it on my mind. I asked her if it was true. She said she acknowledged it. The fact that my country doesn't have winter made me didn't have any experience with it. It is true that I've seen snow on television but it was different when I saw it directly. Danielle will never forget what happened to me that day. I think I will never forget it either. It was great that she told me about it because she also made me laugh. In conclusion it was amazing that I could see snow directly although it the experience made me embarrassed. What made me embarrassed was my reaction when the first time I saw it.
