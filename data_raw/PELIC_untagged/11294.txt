I think friend is a person who cares about each other. I have a friend that lives in Korea whose name is Hye Yeon. She often knows my feeling even if I don't say about it. We usually spend time in Mok dong which is her favorite place watching movie or just walking around. Hye Kyung whose friend of Hye Yeon is also my best buddy. I first met her at church which I attended since 6th grade. She has a talent that makes everyone happy. I cannot think of my life without them who cheers me up because they were always with me when I was happy or sad.
