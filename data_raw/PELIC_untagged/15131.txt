I have been being Pittsburgh for 6 months and I have been learning English in ELI program for two semesters. Although I learned English when I was in high school my English is not good enough. I have a lot of hobby. I have learned to play piano for 10 years so when I used to play piano in my home. Not only piano I can also write calligraphy. I have learned how to write calligraphy since I was ten years old. Those two are my hobby for lors of yeas.
