If you want to study in ELI next semester it's important for you to sign up by now. If you don't sign up early maybe it's full and you can't attend the course. By the way I have some suggestions for you. While you are staying in Pittsburgh you should go out with friends do any activities and visit some places. Don't only go to school and then stay at home. Even if Pittsburgh isn't a big city it has many interesting places to go. If you like to go to museum you should go to Carnegie museum Andy Warhol museum and History museum. If you like shopping you can go to Southside works or Waterfront because they're not far from Oakland and you can reach there by bus within 20 minutes. But if you have car and want to shop in outlet you could drive to Grove City outlets in which you're able to shop brand name's product in cheaper price. When you want to go there and need someone to go with I can go with you if I'm not busy. I hope you will enjoy your life here.
