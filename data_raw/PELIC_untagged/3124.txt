I prefer to buy the jewelry because long time ago my mother sold her jewelry to give me money. So I want to give her back her jewelry. However the event might happen again in next year and I can attend it but the money I can not have it again. In addition if I choose the ticket anything may happen and I can not attend the event. For example I might be sick before the event so I will lose both of the money and the event. Also the event might be cancel. So I prefer I to take the money and find the best jewelries' store and I look for a good piece of jewelry and buy it. After that I will give it as a gift to my best woman I have ever met who is my mother.
