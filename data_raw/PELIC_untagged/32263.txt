There are several things in my room that make it up gloomy. First it has a dark color on some of wall so I look up on Internet what is the color that cheer me up. I find up blue color is one of that so I will touch room wall up by blue one. My room has big window and it looks sunny at the day however at night it has darkness so I will put a lamp up in right corner. The last thing I have to turn the bed around and my head will be down of the picture that I have already hung it up.
