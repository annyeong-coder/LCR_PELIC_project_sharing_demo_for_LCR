A guy and a ponytail on a passer by saw a girl who was dancing on Thursday 02. 28. 08 At 07 55PM and he wanted to hug her. He told her that you look like a mermaid but you walk like a waltz and the girl said what Then he said yeah I know I made a mistake I'm a monkey but still I suggest to meet in the southwest corner of the intersection of 5th and 42nd streets at noon tomorrow. And he offered having sex with him but the girl didn't response but she let him do what he wants.
