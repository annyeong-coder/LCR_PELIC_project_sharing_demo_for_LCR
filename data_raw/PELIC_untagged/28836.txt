In modern civilization there is diversity in people's perspectives about what is common between males and females in their learning career and even in a way of thinking. Women are capable to study science math and technical subjects as same as men. Despite the fact that women are not equal to men in physical strength I believe that women can excel in all fields of science. Not only I have a bias towards women but also I can provide examples of some women who have a great contribution to reinforce our communities and societies. Although pursing scientific and technical subjects might keep women away from their basic role women always believe that family comes first. So they try their effort to balance between work and home. Pursuing men in fields of science is not evidence of extraordinary abilities which do not exist in women but because of their ability to devote themselves for studying. The reason behind this is women either mothers or wives who provided a suitable environment for learning acquisition. Women led to the superiority of men.
