It was eight years ago a accident occured on my sister and her boyfriend. They travlled to a city bu bus. It was a long trip so that the driver became tired. When the bus was crossing a crossroad it was hit by a car. Fortunately my sister and her boyfriend didn't sustaind massive injuries. But my sister's arm was scratched by the glass fragment. Later she was sent to the hospital and was taken medical care. She was really frightened by that accident. Until now she is still afraid to take bus.
