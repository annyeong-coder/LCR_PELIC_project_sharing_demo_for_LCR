This summer I am going to travel to Hawai. I will buy my tickets in advance to avoid high prices. I will reserve a nice big room in the hotel preferably with pool. I going to spend about two weeks in Hawai and then fly to California to see my relatives. I will spend some time in Los Angeles and San Diego. I am going to see the aquazoo and make good pictures. I will also go to the Beverly Hills as a tourist. After my vacation I am going back to Pittsburgh to study english in ELI. I will take at least five classes for the next semester. I am going to improve my language skills and impress my teachers. This summer will be full of traveling and expectations.
