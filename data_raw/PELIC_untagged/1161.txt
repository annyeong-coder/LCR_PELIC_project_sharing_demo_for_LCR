October 29 2006 Dear liyla I want to tell you I am going to buy used car. Used car is cheaper than new one. I think that I can find cheap decent car in some garage. Also I can check this car if it good or not on the other hand used car help me to save my money so I can use it in some something more important. See you soon. Sincerely
