Yesterday I called up my doctor's office for an appointment. As usual they asked me to hold on so I waited and waited until I gave up and ended up the call. After 30 minutes the phone rang but I was busy so I didn't pick it up when I checked out my voice mail I figured out that the clinic had called me back.
