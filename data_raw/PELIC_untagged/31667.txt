Food in my country is tastier than the food in the U. S because in my country we have some gradients that make the food more tasty. The food in my country is more delicious than the U. S because my mum coocked it for me. The food in my country is fresher than the U. S because my father have a farm and it contain a lot of fresh vegetables.
