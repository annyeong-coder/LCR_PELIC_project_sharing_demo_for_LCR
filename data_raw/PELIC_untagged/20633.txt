I'll take a fishing line to catch the fishes. When I am hungry I'll eat them. I'll take a fire lighter to make a fire. If I don't make a fire I won't cook something and heat myself. I'll take star shell. When I see somebody away I'll signal to them with it. I'll take a photo of my children to remember them. I'll take enough Turkish tea to drink.
