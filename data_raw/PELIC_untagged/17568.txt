What I like about the US is how friendly Americans are. One thing that I love about the US is that they always smile to strangers actively. The relationship that I envy of the US is when the US gets in a trouble which has many countries fight for them. A thing that I don't like about the US is how inconvenient the transportation is. What I hate about the US is why restaurants charge extra tax and tips. The only thing that I really don't like is that the living expense is much more expensive than Taiwan.
