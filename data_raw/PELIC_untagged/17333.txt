My living room is not bright and sunny enough. It is too calm and quiet to cheer me up and sometimes this gets me down. I look around the room and find out how to fix the room up. I figure out that I am going to buy a perennial plant which I will place in the corner of the room. I am going to pick up some pictures which I will put them up on the wall as well. If it is turns out well my living room will become full of vitality. I think my action will pay off and I will end up feeling energetic in my living room. It's worth trying on.
