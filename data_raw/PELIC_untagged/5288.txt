I thought this was homework. T. T I could not throw it because I've been working on it for sometime. Would you give me a feedback for me Please. . That would be nice for my writing. I'd like to say that the air conditioner's place in the classroom in ELI should be changed. Because I always felt I was standing on the north pole during teachers taught me in the classroom. It was too cold to concentrate on anything but I was freezing to death. On the other hand I think teachers felt warm because the air conditioner places behind students. One day I was sitting right before the air conditioner and I felt my hair was flying. Then I start to worry about my head and I think it is too much. So there is one possible solution for both teachers and students some engineer in University of Pittsburgh move the air conditioner to other place in class room. Write ONE PARAGRAPH which gives an example of why the ELI at the University of Pittsburgh is a good choice for students who are planning to study English in the US. I'd like to say that the system of learning English at the ELI is good for students who are planning to study English in the US. Before I moved to U. S. A. I had studied English for a long time but I could not use it well. Now I've been a student of ELI for about 2 month and I've learned many things by different kinds of homework. For example every homework is related to writing such as grammar reading listening even to speaking. At first it was so hard for me to write a paragraph and I could not avoid it because it was homework. However I think my writing is getting better as I 'm working on the homework. In addition I can use many expressions in grammar on my writing. In my country I had studied separately and did not use some expressions at all. At ELI I can use different things in different classes.
