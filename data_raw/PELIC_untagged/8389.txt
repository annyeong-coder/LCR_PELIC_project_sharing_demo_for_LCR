We live on the Earth and everyone can't live without the air. However the air quality is an important environment issue that people concerned. The air pollution has several forms that they are acid rain smog and particle dust. Acid rain can cause destroy buildings and crops and it is harmful to health. Smog and particle dust can affect people's lungs. Smog can also cause traffic accidents. How can we solve the problem We should know how it is formed and then we can find a solution. Acid rain and smog are caused by the sulfur dioxide nitro dioxide and other chemicals that are emitted to the air according to the scientist research. The particle dust is caused by construction and wind due to improper plant cover. Many SO2 and NOx are produced by coal combustion automobiles and fire of forests. So we should reduce the chemicals emit to the air and enforce the construction. We should use technology to desulfurization and reducing other chemicals emitting to the air.
