The movie named A unfinished the life is my favorite movie which narrates a simple story. A father whose only son dies in a traffic accident drive his daughter in low away from his house because she causes the accident duo to her careless driving. After many years two of whom meet again. The different experiences of life have them learn that they should forgive each other and recover themselves from the misforture. The future life should be beautiful. I like this movie from which I can learn something.
