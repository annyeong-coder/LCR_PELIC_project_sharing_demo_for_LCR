I once worked with a special computer program which is used to solve a complex mathematical problem. I wanted to figure out a better way which is different from the solution indicated in the textbook. It was a great challenge. I have focused on the problem for several days. I lost the idea about time and I could stay in front of my computer for a whole day without eating and drinking. I learned more programming skills and more details about problem. I eventually found out a better Algorithm to deal with the problem. In this experience I did sense of flow that can benefit me a lot in creativity.
