Something make me to feel bed and some of them makes me to cheer up. I'm going to clear up about this. I feel bored when I usually get back or stay home. It makes me to feel bed. For instance a blunt neighbors the bed view and darkness room. I made up music when I feel bored subsequently it makes me to cheer up. I'd like to change my feeling. I feel lately that something make me lazy. I need to decide as soon as possible to move out another apartment 'cause bed view and darkness room.
