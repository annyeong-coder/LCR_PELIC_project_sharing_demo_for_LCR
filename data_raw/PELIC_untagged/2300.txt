Last year my family was traveling on an airplane. We were traveling from the US to our country. After a 14 hours flight we had to transit at Taiwan. We had three hours for waiting the next flight. First we took a rest for an hour. My father said he had some old Taiwanese money and we had to use all money because it would be too old to use for buying something. Then we started to use all that money we bought a lot of things such as clothes iPod whisky cigarettes and chocolates. We spent the rest of time for shopping and we didn't notice the time that it would be out of time. While my mother was looking for cloth I recognized that it was time to board. Therefore I told my family that we had to enter the gate in five minutes but my mother was paying for her cloth. It took for a while because cashier didn't know an old money so he must ask someone whether we can use that money. After we paid we ran to the gate and some staffs were looking for us. We were the last passengers of the flight. When we were in the plane we knew that we should have come to the gate early. We should not have been the last group of the flight because the flight was supposed to take off on time. We were very tired and excited. We should not have spent the whole time for shopping. We could have left or exchanged money. In a similar future situation I should notice the time and manage my time better. I have to wait at the gate before boarding time.
