Hi buddy. I have new interesting hobby! You know that I like any sports. When I was in Korea I could not play or watch American football. Since I came to the U. S I have watched American football. By the time I tripped New York I had played American football. Actually I just threw football with my friend. It was my first time. It was really interesting. Shape of football is oval. I wanted to trow football like professional player but it was so hard. I and my friend had been trowing before we had lunch. I have been practicing to throw football. We can enjoy that when I go back to Korea. I will buy a football.
