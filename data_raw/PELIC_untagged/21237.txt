I know I myself use a different English. Information have overridden correct expression in my English. Sometimes native speakers can understand me but non native speakers never understand me. I think native means having high ability to understand ambiguities. Though Pittsburgh people are use to foreigners and retain patience I have felt people in another area refused strange English. I think that is usual people don't like to be patient bland situation. If I talk with familiar people I use all my ability of English even if strange and incorrect. Because they understand I'm a disability in English. But if I need to speak with unknown people I use limited and a little bit English which might be correct. But I don't like these way because former require listener's patience and latter is boring.
