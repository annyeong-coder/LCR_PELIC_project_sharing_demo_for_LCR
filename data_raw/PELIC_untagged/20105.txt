The Causes of Social Problems in Venezuela Venezuela is a country which has lot natural resources such as oil gas and sea but we did not have a good political system. For many years we have had different presidents and everything is equal a country with many problems and just some people receiving good benefits. In recently years we elected Hugo Chavez how our president many believed him like someone that could change Venezuela in a better country. He had co eapons new patrol cars and so they could work better. Other social problems of Venezuela is the healthcare. First of all hospitals are damaged the government has not invested enough to supply medicines beds medical equipment and everything needed to function correctly. Also doctors are not receiving a monthly salary appropriate as they should receive for a job they spend considerable time and saving lives. The private clinics they have good doctors equipment and facilities but are very expensive this leads to a great social problem in the country the government cannot solve. Finally and most powerful social problem in Venezuela is poverty. It has been several presidents some more good than others but in the end people still live in poverty. One of the main reasons is that people have not studied at university after completing high school many begin to work and forget their studies. On the other hand there is much unemployment in the country because the government does not encourage private enterprise to create more jobs. In conclusion there are many causes of social problems in Venezuela have deteriorated some as insecurity health care and others have improved a little like poverty because the price of oil has remained fairly high in recent years. It is important to mention that Venezuela could be an economic world power this is achieved by using natural resources to benefit the country and helping people.
