There are several things in my house cheer me up. And I will pick out three things of them such as the entertainment my bedroom and the kitchen. Also I would like to touch up the walls with new paint. Then I should light up the living room with some beautiful candles. After that I have to tear down the wall between the kitchen and the dining room to give some room there. Also I should throw out the sofa and replace it with a new one. Next I have to hang up some picture on the wall to make it more beautiful.
