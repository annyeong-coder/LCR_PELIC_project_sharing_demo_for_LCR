Every job needs its suitable skill and quality. Among those jobs one of the important jobs which can cause someone's mind to be happy is a florist. A florist is a person who owns or works in a shop that sells flowers and plants. This one seems to be very easy but I think it needs very special skill and quality. First of all a florist needs to have a sense of beauty which can make the harmony of color when she makes a bouquet or decorate some places with flowers. Without this her works cannot induce people to feel its beauty. Second she is supposed to have creativity and originality. When she makes something with flowers she could copy from other works. However only with her creativity and originality she can make something which customers want to have. Third she must have a way of using her hand. With clumsy hands it is natural for her not to make something beautiful. So if there is someone who has these skills and qualities and who really likes flowers I would like to say to them how much this job is important to people.
