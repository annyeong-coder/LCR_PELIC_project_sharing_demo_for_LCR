My writing habits The best environment for me that can help me to write a really good topic is when I stay at home and there is not any noise. Also I like to sit in a straight backed chair at my desk. In addition the place must be clean. I prefer to study in the morning because my mind is clear. To help me think better I like to have a pencel and a notebook. Also the light must be bright. I prefer the temperature to be cool when I do all of these things. Then I can do good work.
