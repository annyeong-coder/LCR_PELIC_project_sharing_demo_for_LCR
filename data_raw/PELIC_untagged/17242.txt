A movie I have seen recently is BOLT. This movie is an animation which I like a lot. Bolt is a dog which has a lot of special power. He is also considered as a hero. However he is just an normal dog. All super powers are not from him but from the people. Bolt thinks he is a super hero so he needs to protect his owner whose name is Penny. Bolt never lives as an normal dogs. One day he is sent to New York by accidentally. He meets a cat which is a normal cat. The cat led him go back to Hollywood. During the trip he learns how to be a normal dog. He also realizes he is just a normal dog without any super power. Finally he finds his owner and Penny quits the job. After they quit they have their normal live.
