Out line 1 using websites 2 contact with Japanese community club in Pitsburgh 3 contact with apartment company I started to find an apartment in Pittsburgh before arrived 6 months. It was so hard for me because I could not understand English well. I needed to support to finding for the apartment without English. However it was impossible. I found the website that is Japanese community in Pittsburgh. I got some information about the apartment and did three steps. First I resarched some information about Pittsburgh because I wanted to know which area is safety or denger place. In addition I was looking for an area which is close to public transportation and a shopping place. In view of these trends I decided in living area. Next I contacted with Japanese community club. They have a big mailing list. These information were so helpful for me. I could sent a email to them directly if I had some questions. And then I found the apartment that is a cut above what I would usually find in the area. Finally I contacted with letting agent. I send some my information and money order.
