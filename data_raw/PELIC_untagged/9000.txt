I asked Park that what news in his country is but he answered that he didn't prepare any news to class. However he claimed that he did remember an educational issue in South Korean. He told me there is a big problem about the entrance exam in South Korea and this exam is likely to be a gate way for getting job in the future. He added that every student in South Korean wants to pass this exam because he she will be able to attend a public university. Also he noted that if someone fails he she has to wait until another exam next year. After that I asked him what should be the best solution for this problem. He replied that the government should increase the frequency of the test from once a year to three or four times a year. On top of that I asked him why he thought this would be the best solution. Suddenly he pointed out that this way could help students have more opportunity to get in a public university.
