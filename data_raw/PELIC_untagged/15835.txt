1. Describe a style of art or a work of art that you like. Why do you like it I would prefer that I watch Impressionism Arts such as Monet Renoir Sisley and Gogh. According to the Wikipedia the encyclopedia Painting realistic scenes of modern life they emphasized vivid overall effect rather than details. They used short 'broken' brush strokes of pure and unmixed color not smoothly blended as was customary in order to achieve the effect of intense color vibration. I think Impressionists draw to use several colors on the canvas. When I watch their arts I feel bright and fancy. Also I like the sunflower of Gogh. It seems alive. If I watched Monet's arts I feel calm too. Because of I would like to watch Impressionism Arts.
