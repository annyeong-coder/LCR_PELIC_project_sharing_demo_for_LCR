Limiting Internet access time will never give advantages. I think it is a wrong approach to treat the problem. It's also oppressing students because students sometimes need to spend more time online. For example if a student has a research he or she wants to look for a lot of information about. In the other hand it is not curing for webaholics. Prevention has never solved anything by itself. Students will spend all the time they can in the lap until the last second. In addition they will look for other possibilities to work on the internet and they might spend much more time in thinking about them. Also they might find other places outside campus that will waste their time. In contrast giving information to the students and keeping them aware about the disadvantages and the dangers of webaholism will keep them away by them selves. Overall limiting Internet access time is not effective injustice for other students cause students be worse webaholics and even harmful. Other ways like keeping them aware will be useful.
