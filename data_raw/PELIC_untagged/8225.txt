I have two majors. It was so big deal for me to get those. When I was undergraduate school student I had been busy every day. Frankly I had been living alone since I was 17. I had two part time jobs in order to make my living expenses and always had a lot of assignment. When I was sophomore I decided to try to get another major. Before I decided it I had been thinking about what subject was fitted for me. Also I was wondering of my ability. Nevertheless I was trying to take two majors since I was junior. To be honest while I was taking two those I had been thinking about my career for future. I had wanted to study more after I graduated. But my personal situation was not good to study. But I didn't give up. I was always thinking that I would survive. In 2007 I graduated and I got two diplomas. It made my parents proud me. On top of that I was chosen one of top students who got top grade in my university. Besides I made enough money to study in United State for almost one year. For the above things I would like to choose this as my personal achievement.
