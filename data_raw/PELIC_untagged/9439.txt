My living room is scattered and disordered. I always think my room is cleaned by strategy. But I didn t try challenge. When you come in the door the first thing you will see scatter of clothes. There is Text book on top of desk. In the middle of the room there is my bed. I do not arrange my bedquilt on top of bed. Maybe My room will maintain the state. In fact my room s concept is freedom. Do you know fish go away in clean water.
