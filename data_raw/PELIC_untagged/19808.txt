My hometown Wuhan which locates on the middle between the North and the South of China is a modern city. The Changjian which is the longest river in China crosses my hometown and divides it into three parts. One is named Wuchang which is educational zone with nearly hundred universities and colleges. The others are named Hankou and Hanyang which are commercial zone filled with lots of shopping stores and industrial zone filled with factories. The bridges in Wuhan play an important role that links the three parts as one large city in which traffic is very convenient. Spring and autumn are beautiful and comfortable in my hometown where winter is also not cold. However summer is so hot that you think you might be cooked. I love my hometown where I had lived almost 40 years I miss my hometown which my relatives and friends live in I anticipate the day coming soon when I can go back and eat the variety of freshwater fish as well as a great deal of fresh vegetable again.
