It was August 2008 Me and my parent had arrived to USA we had never visited US. We came here for my brother's wedding party he is living in California. It was too hot in California I had never imagined it is hot like that in USA but it was nice. By the time I arrived to CA I started biking every day I had never enjoy biking for along time. I am happy to be in USA.
