My name is Abdoallah. I am from Libya. I am studying English language at the ELI and taking the GRE course at Kaplan University. Usually I go to the ELI at 9 30 AM and I go back to my home at 1 00 PM. Now I am not working but I will work when I go back to my country. My best hobbies are reading books and traveling. I have many friends here in Pittsburgh usually I meet them when we have free time. My best friend's name is Brandn. He visits me every weekend.
