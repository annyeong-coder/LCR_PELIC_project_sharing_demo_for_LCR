First of all after a busy day if you really feel exhausted and tired sitting on the bench which is in front of the sea and if the weather is sunny it can be a perfect rest as much as a good sleep. According to the social workers sleeping well is healing our feelings. In my opinion taking a rest behind that kind of scene has a strong effect such as sleeping like a child.
