Everyone wants to live in good environment and neighborhood. It might be ideal habitat for all. What do you think if the government plans to build a prison near your house It sounds horrible even though we just imagine about it. I can say that I will strongly ban this unreasonable decision. There are three point why I disagree with building a prison in my neighborhood because of potential danger bad influence on educational environment and estimate price. First of all It must be extremely dangerous. Think about that If many criminals live with your family and neighbor can you sleep well Definitely No. Probably I will be unhappy about this terrible truth every single day. The reason why I live with the most dangerous people in the world. It can be so fatal and critical excuse. Moreover If there is a prison around my house it would be harmful for my children's educational environment. For children Educational environment is really important even some parents are willing to move to other place for their children's future because they easily accept their environments and situations whether it is good or not. In addition building a prison in my neighborhood can decrease the price of promises or estimates.
