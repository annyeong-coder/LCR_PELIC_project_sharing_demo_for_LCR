My first week in Pittsburgh is astonishment. I came in Pittsburgh on Thanksgiving Day that I did not realize tradition of this holiday before. I saw crowd on the street near Robinson Mall. As I rant out the hotel it was near Robinson Mall. So I went to Robinson Mall I saw a price of clothes that is seventy percent off. I had been gotten a lot of thing before I found the apartment. In addition I met people who lived here . They were kind to me. For instance My English was distress. I can not communicate with American people and also they were not comprehension me. On the other hand American people in Pittsburgh attempt to fathom out that. Most importantly I was amazing the nice view in Pittsburgh. I never see the night light when I stay on the bus that I saw one river between the two mountain that is so wonderful.
