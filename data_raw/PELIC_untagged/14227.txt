My favorite food is a grapefruit. There are three different types that it's pink grapefruit white grapefruit and ruby red grapefruit. First I eat it when I push the spoon into a half grapefruit. I think that it's the best way of using. Because I can enjoy fruity flavor with freshly extracted juice. Next sometimes I make grapefruit juice with pulp for full sweet. I like sweet and sour. Finally I think that grapefruit is rich vitamin. I will have a smooth and silky skin when I keep eating grapefruit. Grapefruit is tasty and it has an effect on health and beauty.
