He couldn't go to school because in my city wasn't able to have school about people are blind but he was able to want to read and write so he went to mosques. He could study in mosques at 6 months and he could read and write. After that he couldn't go to study in Iraq because he didn't have enough money. He could need job because he wanted enough money.
