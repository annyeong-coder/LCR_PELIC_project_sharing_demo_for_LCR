I think it is very important that children know how to cook because they can be more independent. Also it is a good idea that the family cook together and they have a fun time of learnig. Another benefit of to know cook is that when the children grow up they could cook in their home and they don't buy food. Finally I think it is very important to put emphasis on the parent to teach their children because it is the best form for the chilren know to eat healthy food.
