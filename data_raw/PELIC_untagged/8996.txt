Today ANON_NAME_0 said that they have serious problem in Korea. He pointed out The stupid president makes people suffer. ANON_NAME_0 noted that their president has intended to lower the realty price by using stupid policies. Making new satellite towns for example Korean nowadays has too many new towns made by government however a few people really move into these new towns. Subsequently he added that the realty price has even decreased. Additionally he observed that Korean people also suffer serious inflation. Surprised I asked I can't understand. I heard that the Korea's economy is booming. ANON_NAME_0 remarked Even though the economy is booming most people can not enjoy the benefits. Interested I replied We do have super stupid president too. What a coincidence pal!
