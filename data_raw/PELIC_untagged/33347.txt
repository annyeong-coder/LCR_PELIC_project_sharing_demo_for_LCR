When I was 16 I underwent a knee arthroscopic surgery it was my first one and it hadn't done perfectly. By the time it ended I had such a bad feeling about my condition and my future ability to play football with my friends again . I had been a complainer about my physical condition for two months therefor I had been annoying some of my relatives all the time when I experienced a real lesson. A serious physical problem for someone who had been challenging it wherever he went an amputee man who had gotten a prosthetic leg. He had been driving to work and walking to the grocery without such complaining I had never been testing before that. By 2003 when I had the second surgery I had already subjected to an experience that made me a grateful for everything might happen to me.
