I feel comfortable about my room because I pick out all the furnitures by myself. I always keep on cleaning my room and never give up cleaning it. Everyday I went back home took off my jacket and sat down on my chair I feel good. I like to turn on lights in my room because I like bright condition. I will throw away all the trashes everyday and it makes me feel comfortable. In my room I never have difficult in looking up things because my room is not messy. Every day I like to turn on my computer when I get home. I would never turn it off until I sleep.
