In Taiwan there are many differences between urban area and rural area. One of them and could be the most important one is shops. People always need to shop for their commodity products like items to use food to eat and clothes to wear. There are many shops on every streets in urban area and they are always variet. When you ride a scooter on a street you can see stores selling clothes food books maby furniture and lots of products you want! You also can see the same store twice or even three times on the same street. Isn't that incredible But when you are in rural area you need to ride almost 20 to 30 minutes to find a store and probably cannot but all items you need. In addition it is convenient to buy hot food in the middle of the night in urban area not only is because there are many shops in this region but also is because they are 24 hours shops. For me the place where I lived in Taiwan there is a convenient store nearby my house. It only takes me five minutes to walk there. On the other hand when you walk on a street at the same time in rural area there is no people around and not to mention a 24 hour store. So if I want to choose where to live in the future I will choose urban area.
