There are many things that I like about my wife. To begin with she is very helpful. For example whenever somebody needs help she is always there. Especially she likes to help me all the time. To illustrate she even helps me to wipe my car's windshield. Also she is an excellent cook. Maybe it's because she likes cooking. And also I like it. For instance our friends often come to our house to eat the delicious food that she cooked. The another example she helped international fair works even though she didn't responsible for that. She cooked three different type sweet one of that is vegetarian sweet for vegetarion people one salad and bagels. She selled all of them and all money would going to for charity.
