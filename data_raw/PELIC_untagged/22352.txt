When I was 16 years old I was studying in high school. In fact I had a wonderful time with it. I was studying at first year of secondary school. Actually I changed my class from section A to section C which is another class of the same stage because of several valid reasons the previous class was crowded that did not make understand the lesson and I wanted to enhanced my level of knowledge and find new friends. When I entered the new class the students were studying Math and I introduced myself and I will be glad to study with you. And then our teacher put us on group to cooperate with the students to find out the solution of the problems. It is a good method to practice and share ideas. There was a guy who was reluctant to speak with anyone. I encouraged him to speak with us and being effective and then we incorporated our effort to be excellent students in all classes. After a couples days while I was calling him by phone he was implying to go to with me to play soccer. I accepted that and we went to Khober City because there are a lot of sports resources. By the time I graduated from high school and he did too. I acquired my target and he did too. Unfortually he could not go the America since his father was sick but he enjoyed a nice university in our city which is Dammam. Last weekend I was calling him when Pittsburgh was snowing and he told me He is good and he accomplished the foundition year in the university and looking forward to choose his major which is Business Administration. Finally it is a principal factor to be susseccfull is having partner or best friend in your life.
