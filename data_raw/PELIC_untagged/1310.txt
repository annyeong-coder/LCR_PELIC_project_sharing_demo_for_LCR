Topic Dancing Adjective professinal dancer Prepositional phrases in the group When I was in the Senior High School about five years ago I learned about how to dancing so it makes me to a nice dancer. First I joined a group in school that teaching how to dancing. I had that class every Wendsday afternoon. I was very enjoy it. Second I joined another group outside of the school. There have some professional dancer in the group. When I joined this group I met some good friends they are pretty good dancer. I practiced with them almost every day after school.
