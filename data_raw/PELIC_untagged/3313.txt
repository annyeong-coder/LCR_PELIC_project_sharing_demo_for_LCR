The most memorable place in my childhood is a mountain house where I spent every summer with my grandparents and my aunt's family when I was an elementary school student. My grandfahter purchased the beautiful house which is located in ANON_NAME_0 prefecture for his chidren and grandchildren to get together. The house was sold after my grandfahter died so I can't visit there any more. However I still remember the days when I spent and play with my cousins in the house and the scene we playes around the house smelling the nature. Everytime I go to the mountain to treck the smell of the nature such as soil trees and leaves remind me of my childhood when I was playing in the forest climing a tree or swimming in the river near the mountain house. Moreover It also reminds me of my grandparent' smiling. Therefor although the house had handed down it is the place where is filled in a lot of precios memories to me. That's why the mountain house is still very important for me.
