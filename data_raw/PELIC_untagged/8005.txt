My grandfather always says Nobody knows his destiny. I was 18 years old studying in the high school. I planned my future. Everything was going well as I thought. I finished the high school with excellent grades. I wanted to study at the best university in my country. I applied for study there. However they refused my requisition. Then I've never imagined myself study abroad. I got a scholarship from the ministry of higher education.
