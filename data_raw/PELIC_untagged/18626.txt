Obligatory national service In Korea military service is a mandatory. Every young healthy man has to serve in our military or work in related jobs for at least 2 years. It is not rational for so many reasons. Most of people who go to military are university students. Many students suffer from the gap between their educations. While they are away from the school for two years many things change academically. New theories come out and new techniques get developed. When students come back to school they have to work extra hard to make up for their lost periods. Besides many students claim they don't remember most of what they learned before they went to the military. That's also a great deal of loss. Additionally they are not devoted to serve the country so they can't perform like professional soldiers. Everybody loves their country but it doesn't give them enough motivation to serve the country for 2 years. They're inherently businessmen artists
