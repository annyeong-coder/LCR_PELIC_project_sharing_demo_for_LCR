ANON_NAME_0 5U June 2 2010 does birth order affect an individual's personality From my experience I found that the birth order affects an individual's personality. I think the first child is always spoiled. For the first baby parents always care or over care about him or her because this is the first time for them to have a baby and their life will become different because of this baby. Also the first child is crucial for them because it means the first true connection between the parent and it also means that it will be the first time for them to see their child speak play and walk. In the other hand the second and the third child will not find it because it almost the same. For example the second child will use the first child's bed and toys. I was the second child and that what I felt.
