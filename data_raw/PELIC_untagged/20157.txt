None of single personality type applies perfectly to a person but for me one comes closer than all the others. In personality category 'extrovert' is fit to me. I'm a kind of person who is shy often. However when I enjoy a party I can be a person who really enjoy the party. Also I'm a person who introduce by myself and try to make a comfortable atmosphere in a group which the people meet at first. Another personal category that I'm fit to is a 'perceiver'. I'm a kind of person who doesn't have much plan. For example when I go out to dinner I always have open mind so I can go any restaurant. Even if I made a plan I could change that plan. Also I'm easily adapted to any situation. In other words I'm very flexible.
