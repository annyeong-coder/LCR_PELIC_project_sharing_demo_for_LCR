As my group will be on the island for five weeks I think we might need a knife. With a knife we probably could use it for hunt cook or as protection from wild animals. Besides that I think we should bring matches. Matches would help us to cook brighten our night and keep us warm. Besides that we will take a flashlight with us. A flashlight will definitely useful at night if we need to get something or go somewhere. One more thing that we must bring with us is tools set with rope. I think it will help us in order to build something or in case of emergency. Of course we have to choose wisely and should not bring something useless with us such candy or chocolate.
