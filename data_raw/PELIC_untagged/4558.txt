I think you need to have more than one quality to receive the score or the grade that you are a good doctor. First you need to start about his personality he needs to be a gentleman or a lady not good looking but always you need to have a great presence smells magnificent and respect everyone. At meantime you need to try the patient if he is the most important thing in the world the patient needs to feel very comfortable to accept your advices and your treatments. This is not the only quality other quality and no least important than the last one is your knowledgment because the patient has to truth in you and the only way that this happens is to talk them and explain every diagnosis that you have in mind but in this explanation you can't use medical terminology because it is possible that the patient can't understand you this is why you need to have an excellent knoledgment because you need to translate the medical words to some kind of simple language to explain them about your possible diagnostic. The last quality is the doctor needs to be a very good human being.
