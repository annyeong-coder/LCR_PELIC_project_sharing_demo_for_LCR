There are three major types of wine table wine sparkling wine and fortified wine. The table still wine has approx. 8 To 15 alcohol the level at which alcohol kills off the yeast. Sparkling wine has approx. 8 To 12 alcohol plus CO2 Carbon Dioxide . The last fortified wine has approx. 17 To 22 alcohol. And all wine fits into at least one of these categories. However sparkling wine and fortified wine are not more familiar than still wine therefore I talk about only still wine this time. Still wine can be divided into three types white red and rose. The first type for white wines Chardonnay Sauvignon Blanc and Riesling are three major grape varieties. The color of wine comes primarily from the grape skins. Removing the skins immediately after picking means that none of their color is imparted to the wine and wine will be white. The second type for red wines the major grape varieties include Cabernet Sauvignon Merlot Pinot Noir and Syrah. Grapes are agricultural products that require specific growing conditions. For example most red grapes need a longer growing season than do white grapes so red grapes are usually planted in warmer locations. The third type is rose. This wine can be made from the red wines' grapes. For example California's blush is made from white Zinfandel. The longer the wine remains in contact with its skin during fermentation the more it will be colored so rose wine should not be left with skins so long as red. All this there are three types wine white red and rose and all wine has certain amount of acidity. If there are not any acidity it is not wine but juice of grapes. Generally white wines are more acidic than reds including rose. Concerning tannin red wine can generally age longer than white because of their tannin content. In conclusion when you see the color of the wine you know the each wine's characteristic. Color tells you a lot about the wine.
