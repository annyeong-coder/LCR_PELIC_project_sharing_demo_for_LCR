I was invited by one of my friends two weeks ago to have lunch with him. When we started having dinner my wife called saying that the fire alarm just went off. By the time I hung up I could hear the sirens were coming closer. When I arrived I had already noticed that the police officers and firefighters started to evacuate the area. I spoke with one of the firefighters and he said that the neighbors were making barbeque inside the house. From my perspective this experience made me believe that people should be more aware of having barbeque inside the house and they should know how to react when such incident happens.
