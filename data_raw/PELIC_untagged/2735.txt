One of my friends who was borne with physical disability. He can't use his hands like normal one. He couldn't study easily. He needs to a help with his studying because he couldn't. For example turn the page by him self. But with time he started to learn how to use his foots to start depend on him self. Finally he could use his foots for many things such as eating studying and many other things. He was able to take care of himself on everything eventually.
