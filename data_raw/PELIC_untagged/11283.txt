I'm going to describe a person who is really extrovert. He is one of my roomates whom I have been living four years with when I was an undergraduate student. His name is Dong ANON_NAME_0. He likes to know everybody around him which is rare in an technology institute because we have to focus on our endless experiments and projects which make us have less time to know people around us but he is different. He spent a lot of time to make friends while he could get a good degree at the same time. I have always wondered why I think he might be a genius. What's more chinese trodition prefer that people should be introvert. In China people whose personality is introvert might be considered polite. So he is also contrary with this trodition.
