I believe that being creative in school is necessary. In this article the author said that without creative thought the activity simply cannot be creative. I agree with this opinion. Because I also experienced creativity killing education. In Korea the goal of education is focused on the national scholastic achievement examination for college entrance. Some subjects which are not related in this goal such as the music or art or physical education are not regareded as important subjects. But from my perspective with these variety subjects students could build their creativity. Also childhood is very important to learn the way how to think creatively. Some creative thought could make a big improvement. If we want to have a better future than now we have to change our goal of education.
