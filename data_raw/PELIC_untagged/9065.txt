I think I will give others more praise after I saw this diagram. I think confidence is very important for a person. If you don't have any confidence at yourself it's hard to do right things and do things right. When you have problem to do right things and do things right others wouldn't dependent on you and believe you. Then you become very depress on yourself. Finally you lost your confidence. The result becomes vicious cycle. Therefore I will like to try giving more praise when I give feedback to other people. In Taiwan I think most of students lose their confidence because when their get feedback from teachers or their parents always is not good enough. Even more bulk of students who can't get good grades at school are afraid of making mistakes and don't believe their have strong points. Just like my sisters they hardly believe they can study well and get good grades. They almost lose their motivation in learning English. When I go back to Taiwan I would try to teach their English and give them more praise. I hope I can motivate them to learning English.
