When I come back to my place I can feel calm. Now I'm living in the U. S. Where isn't my home country but my place looks like my room in Japan. So it cheer me up when I let me down. There is a Japanese picture there. I hanged it up when I started to live in my place. Then I picked a new ligth which is simple up. I like spending in a tidy room. For it I have to straight up to my place. So. I clean up everyday. I'll carry on thinking about making my place better than now. Sometimes my husband and I talk it over. We really enjoy making my place up.
