All my good friends have been the same type of people with me such as hobby sence of value enviroment and so on exept for the one whose name is Dahee who stayed with the same host familiy last year in Pittsburgh. She is completely defferent from me. The first deference is the age. She was 17 years old and attended a high school which is located in Pittsburgh. The second is country. She is a Korean and do not speak Japanese. The third is personality. She is so smart that she aimed at going to medical school at the Ivy League collrage. She worked for Magee Women Hospital as a volunteer to get good scores. On the other hand I am very dull. In my experience people like her had never been a good friend however we are good friends now because we live eat cry complain and laugh each other. Although sometimes I had something which I could not tell our host mother I could tell her them every thing. We know and accept everything that are even faults. I think that is the most important thing to become good friends.
