I have an unforgettable weekend in my memory. When I was in high school I had a very important exam on a Monday. I should have gone over my book on Sunday before the Monday. My uncle had a wedding on the same Sunday. I have only one uncle and I had to attend the wedding. I didn't know how to choose. Finally I selected the wedding. I souldn't have gone to his wedding party. On that Sunday I went to the party. It was a great party. I was so happy. I forgot the exam. I played card with my friends during the whole night. The next day I was too tired to pass the exam. I might have gotten better score if I didn't play too much.
