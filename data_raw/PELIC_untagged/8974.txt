I usually meet many friends who come from many different countries. I met George at the University of Pittsburgh where there is a good place to study and learn English. He studies in graduate school in which his major is related to medicine. He lived in Mt Lebanon which was near my house. We had the same favorite hobby which was playing soccer. He had a younger brother who lived in Britain. Many people have friends who share many common activities or interests together.
