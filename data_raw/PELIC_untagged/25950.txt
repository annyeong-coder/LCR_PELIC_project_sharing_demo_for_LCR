Learning a foreign language in your country is extremely unhelpful! I have studied a foreign language which is English more than 12 years and I could not make any progress because of some compelling reasons For instance the quality of teachers in other words teachers must be a native speaker in order to ENHANCE the level of education of students and this why students come to the US or England to study English and escape from their country. Having an advantage of being in the same country that teaches its own language does help you intensify your level of education rapidly. However when I was in my country our teacher was from Egypt which speaks Arabic language. He did teach us daily lessons by using accurate English speech but he taught us English in Arabic conversation which is not beneficial at all. Another reason is instructions that institutes give to students. According to my experience we had only one book that is gathered all the skills in one hour every day. Unlike the US schools that specify one hour for each skill of English for students in order to increase students' level. Finally the environment where students live has a strong impact on getting the benefit. Obviously if I live in my country I cannot practice using English. However being in the mother country is crucial step to learn.
