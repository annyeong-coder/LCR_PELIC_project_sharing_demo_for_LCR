Freshman Life at tht University In a University many freshman still don't care too much about their futures or their lives. However If they enter the University they may have many meeting with seniors. Sometimes seniors want the freshman to drink even if he or she doesn't want to. If a student refuses to do what a senior wants the senior may make the students lifevery difficult. So most freshman don't refuse the to suggestions of seniors in Korea. When I entered the University I had many meetings with seniors. Some senior told me what I had to drink. That time I accepted the suggestion but my friend refused. After that experience we had very different lives at the University. Sometimes it is casier to listen to the seniors so they don't make your life hard throughout the school year.
