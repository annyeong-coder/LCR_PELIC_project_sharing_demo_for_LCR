The author mentions that surveillance and watching the kids make their creative urge goes underground and hides. I think sometimes it's important to watch them because they may feel better and say to them that their work is amazing they would continue to work very well. Therefore we should let the children do their work without being interrupted or watched which sometimes feel a heavy evaluation pressure. For example sometimes children afraid to do something wrong while they are being watched which make them focus in their work without being creativity and even make up something new and being innovative. Also the author mentions that putting kids in a desperate win lose situation this is might be a serous problem for kids because other kids would feel depressed which might kill their creativity rather then make it grow more. It has affect on the majority which might consider it unfair sometimes. Therefore I think focusing in the accomplishment makes the children more satisfied and encourage them to the future. For instance encourage the children to do a specific work which all of them have worked together is better than evaluate each one at their works. Finally the author mentions that make the parents choose which activity supposed their children might lead to the creativity killers or kill the creativity because children know what they like by their feelings and nobody can control their feelings so we have to make them choose the activity that they want and support them.
