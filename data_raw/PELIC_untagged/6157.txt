There are several steps to write a paragraph. First I have to write a topic sentence. Then I have to write down as many ideas about the topic as I can. Next I will put the similar items on the list together. After that I will cross out items that I don't belong. Next I will check my ideas. Finally I will looking for the necessary things and start to write about it.
