My favorite kind of music I like listen to all music. I used to listen to fashion music in my country but now I didn't. When I was student I had a lot of time to research much pretty nice music. After I graduated I started to work at the age of twenty five. I had no time to find new music. Because I was very busy. Before I came to here I didn't like listen to about English song. Since I came to ELI we could listen to nice music from our listening teacher's. It is including Somewhere over Rainbow and Richard Marx's The music is lively. Let me create much energy in this time. Therefore my favorite piece of music is Richard Marx's Right here waiting It's a popular music. It's an inspirational music and has a claming effect. Richard is also a masterpieces composer. The nice music is essential to create much energy for people including lively and delighted. By the way we also have to protect genius. To praise composer we'd better not buy copied CD.
