In my opinion and after careful consideration the Achuar's eco tourism lodge is protecting the environment because most workers of the lodge are from the Achuar tribe and that will stimulate them to protect their environment as much as they can. On the other hand the Ecuadorean government believes it can find the money to pay for its social reforms without exploring for new oil wells which could destroy both rainforest's fragile ecosystem and the territories to the indigenous communities.
