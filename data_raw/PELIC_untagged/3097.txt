Our country's university is separated into basically five departments. Those are humanities engineering natural medical and social departments. Our country can do everything by money and we get hard a job. We usually think money is best so we often choose department that we can earn much money. First humane department natural and engineering departments are decreasing in Korea. Those can't earn a lot and those get hard a job. Even though we get a job we can often get lay off from the company. Second medical social departments are popular. Those are many opportunity to earn money. For example social department students can get financial jobs. They know how to earn money. And medical department students will be doctor. In Korea they can earn a lot of money. But students are limited. So elite can only pass Medical departments. The point is that Korea's educational policy needs to be changed.
