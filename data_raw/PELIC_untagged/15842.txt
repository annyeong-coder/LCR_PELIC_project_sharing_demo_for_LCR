In my opinion people can be artist with trained or without train. Some people just born with this gift. Then They grow up to make they own arts. They have they own creative by they own spontaneous. Some other people need to learn how to do it because of this they need to go to school. Of course people without gift started to learn how to be arts can have a good chance to be a good one. The earlied you start the better you improve. In my opinion people who didn't learn how to be artist just can be go if born with this gift.
