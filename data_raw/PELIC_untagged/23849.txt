My favorite room I still remember the room in which I spent perhaps the most beautiful days of my life. It was in a big house which was the tallest one in our street. My bed room is my best room in my house. It is a small but has a wonderful color. The wall and ground of my room has blue color. When you walk in the door the first thing you notice is the huge window at the end of my room. It has white color and it view to the neighbors. It is boring when you view to my window because there is nothing to look outside. My white bed beside the window. There is two nightstand standing next to my bed. On the left side there is huge dresser where I keep my clothes. In the middle wall is lined with bookcases that I keep my books and stories. Over my bookcases there is a mirror where I look to my self everyday. There is my wonderful picture on top of bookcases. When I still look to my picture I feel that I went to my child past. In front of bookcases there is blue chair on the front of my bookcases. Finally when I stay alone in my room I feel more comfortable than most rooms.
