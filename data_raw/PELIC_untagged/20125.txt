Indeed every one hopes to have the best type of personality that applies perfectly to a person and reflect the positive picture with his relationship. My philosophy about the personality type is that any person able to change his type of personality depends on his situation. Some people have an ambiguous personality and you cannot deal with them in which their personality changes depending on their mood and their thinking. Anger between fiends emerges as a result of the struggle between them on specific situation which attribute to the type their personality. In fact the type of personality counts on the environment that the person grew up in and also on the heritage. There are a great deal of types of personality category which actually change with age and experience. Initially the most closely personality that fits me is thinker. I am a kind of person who slow down and predict the result if something bad happens. Thinkers are those who tend to make decisions based on rational and logical reasons rather than emotions. For example my friend and I went to driver license office four months ago to get complete our document and we waited on long line more than three hours in downtown but we rejected because we didn't bring our entire document. At that time I realized our mistake and we should have checked the documents which the office required. My friend reaction exhibited sign of depression that he did not adapt an American culture. Thus we have to accept that and avoid the violation against the law.
