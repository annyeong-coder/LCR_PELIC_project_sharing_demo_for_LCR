As I understand flow is having free time or in other words full time in order to achieve something. The last time I experienced a flow was before going to elementary school. I was a good painter. I was encouraged by my parents and my teacher. My teacher did not used to tell me that I had to paint something I like so I had a completed freedom in this aspect. But After I went to elementary school I had discouraged teacher he always commented about my work by saying This is not what I want! He made me paint some real pictures. Nevertheless he hated my work compared to what it used to be before elementary school.
