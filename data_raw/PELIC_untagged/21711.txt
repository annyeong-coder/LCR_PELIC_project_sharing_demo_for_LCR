I started to learn how to cook since I have come to US. There are two meals which I often cooked and I think its taste really good. One is Kim chi hotpot the other is marinated ground pork with rice. Kim chi is one kind of Korean style vegetable which is made by cabbage with hot pepper. It is convenient to buy it in any Korean supermarket. Many Korean eat it directly but I always cook it. Cooking Kim chi hotpot is very easy just add any ingredients you want to eat such as to fu sliced meat mushrooms vegetable. I usually add just 1 teaspoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of fish spice. The flavor will be better if you add an egg in the hotpot. Marinated ground pork with rice is traditional Chinese style. First put some dry mushroom in the water till it becomes soft. Then chop a grain of garlic dry mushroom. The last step is fry garlic dry mushroom and ground meat with several teaspoons of soya sauce.
