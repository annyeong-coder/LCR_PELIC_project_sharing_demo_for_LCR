On September 1 2008 I was in Philadelphia. It was the first time when I came to the USA and also Kaplan Language School was my first school which is located on the intersection of walnut and locus street. It is close to the most famous street that is named Market Street on which there were a lot of huge buildings like in New York. I had spent my whole time in this place sometimes at the libraries that were so close to my home and sometimes in the cafes that are close to Market Street. I had wonderful times when I was there. There were also a lot of shopping stores which I generally visited. They included different kinds of thing in which I found everything that I want to posses. My apartment was located in a beautiful and also popular place. Why is it popular Because a little part of one of the Rocky film series was played behind of my apartment. Yes Rocky was running behind of the building in which I lived that is known as Park Town Building. Rocky was running towards to the famous Art Museum and I also run when I were there. There was wide and very long road that goes to the Art Museum. Philadelphia was unforgettable place that I had lived.
