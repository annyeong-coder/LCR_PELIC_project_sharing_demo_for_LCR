Home is the place where you feel happy I think home is always a place that you feel very happy. After coming back tired from job or university you need to relax in a place that you feel reach to your satisfaction. Also home is a place that have a charming design. In addition home is a place where you can find yourself. However it bothers me when I saw someone who's heat his home. For example my brother feel very happy when he moved to his new villa in Saudi Arabia because he always dream to build his own house. On the other hand my uncle was very sad when he moved to his new home because the paint spread on the ceramic. Finally I like mostly home which have very lavish rooms.
