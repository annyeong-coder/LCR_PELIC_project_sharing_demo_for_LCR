I like my bedroom in Taiwan. I tried to put up colorful decorations when I started to design my room. I hung up family photo on the wall. It can cheer me up. I also bought a lamp to light up my room. I want to change one thing in my room because I think my closet is too small to put all my stuff. I will buy a bigger one and put away my clothes. I think it is worth trying out because it will make me feel good.
