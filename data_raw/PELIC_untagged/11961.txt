My name is Kwo ANON_NAME_0 Last Name . I come form Taiwan. I have been in Pittsburgh for one year. I am here because my husband works in UPMC. I have two children. They are studying in Liberty Elementary school. I like to cook and travel. Last Charismas I went to the west part of America. That was a good experience for my family. I used to be a nurse but now I am an ELI student in the University of Pittsburgh. Learning English is difficult work. I try to do my best for learning English but I am upset when I don't get a good grade. I like the ELI teachers and classmates. We studied and cooperated together. That is fun. In addition I like to cook Chinese food such as fried rice dumplings and dessert. I enjoy making delicious food for my family. Actually I am cooking dinner while I am writing homework now. I plan to go back to my country this Aug. I think that I will keep learning English when I go back to my country.
