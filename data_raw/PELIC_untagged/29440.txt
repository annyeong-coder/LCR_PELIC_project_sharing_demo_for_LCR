Recently I was shocked that four individuals were killed by North Korean attack. Hearing the news from one of my classmates right before the first class began I was so stunned that for a minute I could not find any words to say. The place bombarded by North Korea is Yeonpyeong Island located nearby the borderline between North and South Korea in the Yello Sea. What makes me really terrified and enraged was that the two of the death toll were civilians. Aside from fear and anger however I felt so sad about the fate of my country. I don't know why we should fight agaisnt each other even sacrificing guiltiless lives. I hope that everyone in charge of this disaster would take a step backwards and cooperate all together to solve the problem putting down individual interests.
