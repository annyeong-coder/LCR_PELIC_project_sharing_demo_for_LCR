I think the most unusual lifestyle are the Hikikomori. They young people who choose to be isolation and they do not leave their cities. They spend all their time in their bedrooms even when they want to eating. They never share anything with others. They do not have any friends and social life. In my opinion they are not carefree and I do not want to be like them. Sometimes the technology requires us to do that but we must enjoy for our times and everything in time. For example time for friends time for fun and time for study.
