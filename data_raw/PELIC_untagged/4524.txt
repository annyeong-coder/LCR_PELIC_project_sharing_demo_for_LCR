If I could live in any time period I would want to live in present. The first reason of my choice I think the past might be inconviniency to live. There were no cars no telephones and no computers. These time those are very important things to make our lives be conviniency and I've already adjusted in present so it will be too strange for me to live. Another reason Anyone inclouding me can't be sure that future is more than present for us to live. In fact it's true that industries and technologies are developing but envionment is getting worth because of developing. I think a quality of life doesn't perfectly depend on technology or money so I can't believe the quality of my life will be better in future. That's why I choose living in present.
