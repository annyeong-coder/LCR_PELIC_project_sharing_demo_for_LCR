My apartment is very good however it needs some changes. In fact My apartment needs to straighten up. I have to buy the curtains and I also take it down all the time because the light of sun. In addition the place of my bed is not appropriate for me. I have to move it around and I also cover it up by red blanket. Also I need to hang up my new picture in my room and throw away the old one. The door of my bedroom is very old I have to change it as soon as possible. Also I have to put up shelf in my room.
