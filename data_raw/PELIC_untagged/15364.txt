I have many friends here in the US. But my best friend who calls me every day. My friend name is Brandn who helps me to learn English. Sometimes he teach me some grammar points. He has a good way to teach me which named grammar practice by the computer. Brandn lives in city named Kent that located in Ohio State. He invited me to visit him so I will meet his brother who is studying Arabic language. Brandn likes travel very well. I will go with him to Hawaii which is the most beautiful place in America.
