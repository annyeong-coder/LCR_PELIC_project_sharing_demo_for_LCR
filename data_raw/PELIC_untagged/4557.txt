If I could live in any time period I'll choose the past the time when I was in junior high school. I still can remember clearly what I've done with my classmates when I was in junior high. I met my best friend Rita. She's a good person that I've ever met. She helped me with my homework and taught me how to study for tests. We talked secrets to each other and solved problems together. She's still my best friend. Another is I had a good time with my classmates. When school had some activities all of us worked together and tried to win the competition. We bagged our teacher to let us practice during the class we also practiced after school. It's really good to work hard with my classmates because we all had the same goal. The last one is I love the time I used to have. We didn't have any problems between classmates we had some fun with each other the important one is we trust each other. All of us were in peace during all semesters. I really love my classmates and I still keep in touch with them. I hope when I go back to Taiwan I can meet them all.
