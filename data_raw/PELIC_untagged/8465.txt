To save money we have to organize extra money except rent fee or utilities well. For a vacation we had better make long term plans a couple of months in advance Because sudden travel could leave a lot of burden in family economy. In case of clothing I can save money more than any other categories because I brought many clothes from my country and I think American style is a little bit different from my taste. Moreover I found that the price of clothes in the U. S. Is pretty cheaper than my country. To save money this kind of methods could help me for losical consuming.
