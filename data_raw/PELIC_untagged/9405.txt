During this winter break we drove a car to Florida from Pittsburgh. This trip is regarded as an amazing trip. On the round way there was a car accident happening in South ANON_NAME_0. This car is possessed by a student Nori who comes from Japan. At that time due to the ice on the ground the car slid into the outside of the highway and hit the curb as well as the broken wheel. Besides another problem associated with this car is its aligning. It is though that we cannot back to Pittsburgh next day because the wheel must been aligned. Finally the car was fixed smoothly next day and we continued to run our trip.
