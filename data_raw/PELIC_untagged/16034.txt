When I was a high school student I always thought my English teacher's methods in a class didn't accord with mine. I didn't concentrate his lessons and it made a gap between the teacher and I bigger and bigger. I should have made an effort to know his passion. However I thought what I acted in the class was right. Sometimes I forgot bringing my stuffs for a class it made for me to take part in a class hard. I could have prepared something for this class and I might have respected my teacher and his class. As a consequence of my action I got a low score in the test and I had to study English in an academy after school. After I graduated in my school I met my English teacher in a street. I realized he really worried about me and he wanted me to enter the good university. I was ashamed of my behavior. I perceived that I should have known his sincerity early. Now my teacher and I are good friend. His advices make me stronger. Also I always respect every teacher and class not to make this mistake again.
