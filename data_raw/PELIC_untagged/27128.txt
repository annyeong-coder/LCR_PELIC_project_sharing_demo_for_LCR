Before I came to United State I had never seen a baseball match it was a great experience because I had been dreaming to see a real baseball match live. Also I had never tried Kayaking I had a really good time riding it but by the time the activity ended I have already got wet. Furthermore I had never seen a real musical concert in my life. I really enjoyed it because I had never imagined that I'd be there and see one of my favorite pop artist. However by the end of the day I have eaten a dinner and slept happy. I have never been in america before but I had been dreaming about it.
