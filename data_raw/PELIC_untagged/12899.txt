I have lived in the United States since December 2007 I have lived here for eight months. I have done a lot of things. I have already visited the Zoo and some of the best museums in Pittsburgh. Last spring I have already taken one semester in the ELI. I am planning to pass the Toefl exam but I haven't prepared for the test yet. Also I am planning to visit Niagara Falls but I haven't got chance yet.
