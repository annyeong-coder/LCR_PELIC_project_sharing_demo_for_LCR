I was reluctant to do whatever my mother told me when I was young. I felt that she imposed on me whatever she wanted without exhibiting the right way. I had a strong desire which was going to another city for college when I was 18. My mother allowed me to live in our high school dorm because she knew it was inevitable for me to leave home sooner or later. After meeting many diverse people all over the world I started thinking that I had a bias against my mother. I decided to compensate my mother of my arbitrary decision of blaming her for everything. I transformed to my mother's sweetheart with calling her every day and thinking about her in every way.
