My Favorite Food I am not good at cooking. However I still have some favorite food. Firstly I like dumplings with egg and Chinese chives inside them. In the past we only ate them on special days such as New Year's Day. But you can eat them any day if you want even now. Secondly I like moon cakes especially when I came to America. I miss my family and moon cakes reminds me of the days with them. Finally steamed bread is also my favorite food. In conclusion I like Chinese food.
