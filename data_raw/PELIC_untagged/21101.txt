Getting my undergraduate degree I decided to continue studying master's degree. While I was studying the master's degree in my country I was working to support my study. Choosing as assistant professor I got a scholarship to continue studying master. Then I had to stop working from the previous job. Now that I am having the scholarship I am looking to complete the PHD. Getting an acceptance in the USA I will persist in my studying. The acceptance in US is difficult because the requirements are extremely arduous. Once I get the acceptance many things in my life will be changed. After finishing the PHD I return to my country and do my job. I will teach and research in a university when I will be at home.
