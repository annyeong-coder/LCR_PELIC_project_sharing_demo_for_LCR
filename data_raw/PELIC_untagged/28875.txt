I couldn't pass my final exam in high school. I could have studied more instead of wasting time. I ought to have gone to bed earlier at nights to get enough test. I shouldn't have hung out with my friends too much. I could have listend to my teacher's advice instead of ignoring it. I could have concentrated on the exam. I shouldn't have been nervous and anxious.
