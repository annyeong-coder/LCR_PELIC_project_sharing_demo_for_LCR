The first relationship between the political power and the individual freedom may have negative influent. For example if someone forced to learn English in the school that he doesn't t interesting in won't be success. The second relationship between the language social and the economic is meaning the language is important for those people are starting their own business to complete his business. For example sometimes you might fill some form in English and if he doesn't know to speaks or write in English how he will complete his own business. If you had to invite some business people that they aren't speak your native language hoe he will communicate. How we will explain our culture for people who aren't from our culture and they don't speak our own languages if we don't speak their language. These connections if the people don't understand them they won't be communicated with other people from other countries and different cultures. It might keep the people a way from the whole world.
