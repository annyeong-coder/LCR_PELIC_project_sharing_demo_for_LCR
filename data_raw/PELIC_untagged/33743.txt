My best friend Today I will be talking about my best friend who I spent with hem a good time. His name is ANON_NAME_0 Bajneed Which is as my brother's name. I hope every person who names is ANON_NAME_0. I knew my friend when we was studying in the secondary school which it was famous school at that time. I traveled with him many places that we think it is the most beautiful places in our country. But he always liked summing that I did not liked it. One day he wanted to go at the beach with his other friend to swim without let me know. Then he went away in the sea. Soddenly strong surge comes at him that he could not get over on it. After that he died and he left one son who he is mane Youssef. When he died each person who liked him was very sad because he was helping every person who he need to help. He died but his achievement which left still until hereafter.
