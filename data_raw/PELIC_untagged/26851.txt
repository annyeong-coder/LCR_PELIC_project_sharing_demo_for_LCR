Recently I watches a movie named Inception. The leading actor is Leonardo DiCaprio who is a famous movie star from years ago. In the world of this story there is a high technology that can let people enter other people's dreams. A team which is lead by an expert thief Cobb Leonardo try to use this technology to steal their targets' ideas. It is a very dangerous task because there are a lot of traps which they can not expect. They can enter several layers of dreams which they create when they feel it's necessary. More deeper layer more dangerous because it may be difficult to them to get back to the upper layer where they come from. The world of dreams is an amazing and complex place where looks just like real world. This story also shows that Cobb is a man who loves his wife and children very much. I am still thinking about some details of the movie which I didn't quite understand when I was watching.
