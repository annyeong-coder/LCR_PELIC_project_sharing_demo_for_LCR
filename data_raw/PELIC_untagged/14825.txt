One of my roommates was accidently locked inside the bathroom. He didn't how to unlock the door from the inside. He was handed lots of equipment through the space under the door. He was told Take off the door knob. However he still couldn't open it for 2 hours. The door was broken by Taizo who was one of my roommates. After all he was able to come out. We called our neighbor and he came our home. The door was fixed by him.
