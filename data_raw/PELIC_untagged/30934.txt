This article states that there was a little bad boy'Jim though' this boy was sinful and curious most times. For example he took vessel of jam from a pantry by steeling and without even an entire whisper that maybe let him return the jam back. Also Jim stole apples from Farmer Acorn's tree and hit a dog by a brick when the dog came to tear him. Another example of that non maral boy is once he stole the teacher's penknife he put it in George Wilson's cap poor Widow Wilson's son the moral boy to protect his self from teacher whipping. Furthermore he stole his father gum and went hunting on the Sabbath. Finally Jam gave the elephant in the menagerie a plug of tabacco.
