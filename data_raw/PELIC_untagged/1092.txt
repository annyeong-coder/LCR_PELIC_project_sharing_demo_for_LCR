When I graduated from the university I was stuck in dilemma. I couldn't decide whether to work or to go to USA to complete my graduate studies. It was hard for me to decide which better. Actually I should've applied for a job. Another thing is that I ought to have gotten marriage before I come here. Any way I am happy now and I hope that I finish my studies and go back to my home.
