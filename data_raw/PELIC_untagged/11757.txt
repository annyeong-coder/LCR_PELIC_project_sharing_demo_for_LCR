I think the dam could be used in my country because we have 21 million people that need to use the water and electricity. Sometimes the weather rains lower and the power stations supply the powers that aren't enough witch bring us about inconvenient very much. If we build them witch would be able to provide us to raise the required amounts of water and electricity. But it's important to pay attention to build it or it might be broken. And then it will be able to make the flood and threaten our lives easily. So the dam usually be built in a large valley and it's far the city. It always need to spend many years and it's necessary to assemble many professional people like engineers architects and geographers to cooperate. Everyone need to realize every details seriously. Finally I think if we want to have a clean and healthy earth it's necessary to economize the sources of energy.
