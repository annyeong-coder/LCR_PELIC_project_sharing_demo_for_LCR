I think we should take a great deal of fresh water. It's necessary to live for human. I think we should take many matches because we need a fire to spend the night and to prevent from wild animals. I think we should take a telescope to look for other ships that can save me. I think we should take maps of the area. It's to figure out where I am. I think we should take a book that is called Tropical Plants You Can Eat because we need to know what we can eat in a deserted tropical island.
