The worst meal experience I've ever had happened when I was 9 years old. When I was 9 my family went to some place which I couldn't remember where it was for a vacation. After we went to many places you went to a hotel buffet. There were a lot of foods. We started to eat. I saw a lot of different kinds of foods like Japanese Chinese Italian and other couturies foods. I was excited about that and tried to eat all kinds of foods. My family just ate for 3 and half hours continuously. I was so full and my family were too. I think that was my worst meal experience because after I ate I got sick.
