Even if there was only one buster in the stadium this episode wouldn't be happened. Every one had a sportsmanship. Johntel Franklin loves sports as well as his mother and they have a good relationship between his team. His team including a couch knew that he wanted to play basketball that time to show his play to his mother. They accepted any charges in order to putting him on the basketball court. The referees didn't call a bias judge. The another team acknowledged his situation and his team's harts after that they showed a honor for his mother and the team's and his decision. Both teams didn't mind whatever the game's outcome. They were not commercial sport activity teams and there was no wheeling and dealing. This episode was really pure and beautiful like one scene of a movie.
