Gwang ju where I grew up is beautiful city which is located in south side of Korea. I have a lot of remembrances about my first house which I lived for 10 years in my childhood. There was a small mountain near my house. I think that the mountain was best place in my childhood. I have two different memories about this site. Almost every weekend my family went to the mountain with some food and playthings. My parent whose hobby is climbing didn't let us skip our climbing activity without special reason. But it was really nice for my health and our family's connectedness. Also I can't forget the favor of food that we ate in the mountaintop. Now whenever we meet together we talk about this memory. I have another remembrance that was made with my friends. We have a secret space near the mountain. After school we always went there for playing. We made a fence using woods and collected some stuffs. One of my friends whose father was managing a big market brought some snacks. It seemed like a hut. This is best space that we have for playing. Two years ago when I went back to my hometown my friends and I went there to find some traces for memorizing our childhood. We couldn't find anything but we could laugh due to just our memory.
