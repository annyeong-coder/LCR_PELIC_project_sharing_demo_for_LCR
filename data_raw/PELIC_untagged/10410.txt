Well my bedroom here in Pittsburgh is not the type that I would like to have so I start to think what changes I can do to cheer me up when I get into my room and I figured it out . Definitely I have to light my room up because I think the colors are too sad for me so I started to cover the wall up with white and red paint then I put some furniture away and I took down some posters that I don't like it also I took the curtains down and that helps to keep my room more illuminate then I straighten my desk up and throw away all the things that I really don't need to make it neat. Then I look over my room to see what else there was left and I saw that my sheets were too old so I just took them off and I bought a new ones. Now I'm end up with my room and I really like the result and every time that I go into my room And look around it I feel comfortable and that I really want to be in that place that just cheer me up!.
