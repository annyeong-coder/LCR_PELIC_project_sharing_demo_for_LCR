When I finished my high school I thought to come to America and get my master degree in economics. But I didn't. If I had come to do my master in America I would have lived by myself or with one of my sisters. As a consequence of that my parents would have been alone in my home town. I wish I had my parents here. If I had finished my studies here I would have gotten a good job and lived here. If I had lived here for a long I wouldn't have married with my husband. If I were not married with my husband I wouldn't have been able to come to Pittsburgh. If I hadn't had the opportunity to come to Pittsburgh I wouldn't have learned English in the ELI. If I hadn't taken classes in ELI I wouldn't get new friends such as Nathali and Reem. I wish I could stay one year more in Pittsburgh. If only my husband were completely happy here.
