Haste makes waste. I really agree with this statement. I had a lot of personal experience in this. For example I studied at a university. One day my teacher wanted to give the final exam for our class. I was surprised about that because he did not give us any lessons throughout the term. I asked him how I could take his exam if I did not learn any thing in his class. After that he appeared very nervous. I do not know why. Next I went to his office and he began to curse at me. I know his reaction was very bad but this was his mistake and I could not do any thing to pass this course. In the end I know now I was not having experience in this situation at that time.
