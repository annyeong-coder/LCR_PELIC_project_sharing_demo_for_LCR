Technology Everyone has at least one piece of technology such as phones or computers. The technology has been becoming basic part of our lives. Everyone tries to get new technology even when it is more expensive. Computer is most important technology for me because I am working on them and earn money from them. There are three effects of computers on our lives becoming isolated wasting more money misusing of technology. Most people spend a lot of time in technologies at work at home and on street. In this case everyone will be busy with these and forget social relationships like family and friend. For example when teenagers play video games they will not care about make friend or any home responsibilities. A lot of money is spent on technology without any reason just they want to have this or that of new technology. Here is the problem majority of people do not know what the benefits if they get this technology. For instance some people buy tablets small piece of computer and they do not use main features of that tablets and those people just follow other people without any planning. Sometimes Technology is used as easy tool to steal money or confidential information by hackers. So many people until now don't trust on technology especially on money transactions. Moreover if children use a technology they do not have any control. So it is difficult to control the children when they use technology. Because the technology still cannot completely identify who the user is the children can browse sexual or violence websites. To sum up be alone spend a lot of time improper use of technology are most dangerous affects . Although I cannot imagine my life without computer. I think I will be idle and I do not have anything to do beside I will lose my job. Technology will be more wonderful and fantastic if we overcome these.
