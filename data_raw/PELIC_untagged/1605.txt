In the University of Pittsburgh one of the most special features is that there are lots of different nationality rooms in the Cathedral of Learning. Each of them is very unlike. Last week we visited two of them the Syria Lebanon Room and the Early American Room. Their functions art style and decorations are quite different. First of all the functions are completely different. For the Early American Room it is like an ordinary American house. Besides the living room and the huge stove the most interesting feature is the secret room. When it is opened there is a bed room upstairs. Because Indians was thought American's enemy and they fought very often American needed a place to protect them. On the other hand the Syria Lebanon Room is more like only a living room. Since Moslem need to pray everyday the room has a prayer niche called Mihrab which was built to face to Mecca. The second difference is their art style. In the Early American Room almost no artworks are inside the room. It might because that at the era Americans were still pioneers to discover the western the artworks were not the most important consideration. The house should be built more practical instead. However the whole Syria Lebanon Room is an artwork. Arabic paintings almost cover the whole wall with some religion words and sentences. Furthermore their decorations are also quite different. In the Early American Room beside the simplest furniture such as long table or benches there are only implements on the wall. For example there are hunting guns iron cranes. Not finished
