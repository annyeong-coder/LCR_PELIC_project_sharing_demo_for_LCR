I have been to Taipei with my best friend when I was 20 years old. I stayed 4 days and 3 nights in Taipei. The trip abroad was the first trip with the friend. So I was excited. Immediately arrived to Taipei we took a bus to go to a hotel. But that was not as easy as we thought. Because there are many people in the bus and we had a lot of stuff. So we were exhausted before trip. We barely arrived at the hotel and we wanted to take a rest. However we went to out to make memory. Although start was hard we ate much delicious food and had a lot of talked with the friend.
