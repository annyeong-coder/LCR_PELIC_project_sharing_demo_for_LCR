They conduct NEO PI R survey which can measure people's personality and they produce 3 profiles. First one is the profile that reflected how volunteers rated their own personalities and the second ones is that reflected how they rated the personalities of other individuals they knew. The third one is that reflected national stereotype by descrbing a typical person from their culture. They found the two personality profiles were based on information from real people matched each other reasonably well but they were significantly different from the third one that stood for national stereotype.
