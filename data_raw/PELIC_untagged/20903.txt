There a few things I had never done before I came to Pittsburgh. First I had never successfully spoken with native English speakers in English. When I talked with them in English I was not able to speak English at all. It was so difficult for me to speak with them because I was not able to understand the English that they spoke at all. Usually they spoke English at natural speed and their pronunciation sounded like unknown words for me. I hope my speaking skill is getting better now. Second I had never experienced Halloween. I was so excited to see people who wore funny Halloween costumes. My son loves Halloween because he gets a lot of candy. He really looks forward to it every year.
