7. Physicians should be allowed to assist people who want to die. I am against the statement. Certain pain is sometimes insufferable. In fact no one can fully understand the pain except the patient himself. Moreover it is also a painful time for a family that is caring for the patient to see him suffering from an extreme pain. As a result patients usually feel sorry for their family members for being a burden to them. Because of the pain and the guiltiness for their family patients tend to feel an impulse to die. The impulse is so strong that patients easily think that death will put an end to all these things caused by them. However death is not the best nor the ultimate answer to both patients and their family. An impulse to die is often turned out to be a temporary one. It emerges and disappears continually according to the emotional condition of a patient. It is so easily changing. Thus when a patient says that he wants to die it is often an expression of his desperate feeling or guiltiness for his family. Therefore what a patient needs when he is faced with a temptation of an impulse to die is not the hasty decision but the unchanging love toward him from his family and friends.
