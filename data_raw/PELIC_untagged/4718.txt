My best friend Riva has influenced me the most. I still can remember the moment when I first met her. I was depressed about the people who I think they were my friends. The one who used to be my best friend didn't trust me with what I said and she told the others not to talk to me. I was really disappointed with her. Then Riva came to our class. She had some of the same problems that I had too. After I understood her problems we solved them together and soon became best friends. She helped me to trust poeple again. She taught me how to tell which people are good or bad. She gave me the courage to do what I wanted to do. She has always been on my side. Now I'm here in America she's in Taiwan we still keep in touch by computer. I'm glad that computer has come to the world.
