Duygu is my classmate she has some unusual experiences. First of all she's ridden a horse in Turkey. She felt excited when she was riding a horse. Then she's taken a long trip by car. She drove about six hours from her hometown to another city. Next she has never climbed a mountain because it's a dangerous activity. Moreover she's swum in a river in her country. Swimming in a river is very comfortable. Furthermore she's sailed a boat with her family. She can see spectacular views on the boat. In addition She hasn't gone camping because she likes to sleep on her bed. Finally she's driven a truck but it's very difficult to control.
