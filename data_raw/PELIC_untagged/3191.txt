Indent Women should keep on working after they marry. However many people think that women should quit their job after they get married because they need to spend a lot of time to take care of the family. Actually I think this is the wrong concept right now. First of all if the reason women need to quit their job is just because they need to take care of the family I suggest women can get a part time job instead of a full time job. A research indicates that women in developed countries still maintain a high percentage of working outside the home after they get married. Nevertheless many of them choose a part time job instead of a full time job in order to have more flexible time to take care of their family. This is a wise solution to the problem of career women who have too little time to take care of their family. Second the cost of living is higher than before and every family needs more than one income to maintain their living standard. Besides this some women's working ability may be better than some men's. Therefore it's a pity if those excellent women just stay at home and do housework. Third it's easy and convenient for women to gain the latest information while they are working. If they stay at home it might be hard for them to catch the current trend and it could cause a gap between her and her family. After analyzing there are many advantages if women keep on working after they marry. For these reasons I support women shouldn't quit their job after they get married.
