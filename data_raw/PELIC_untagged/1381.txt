2 Mounth ago I visited in Toronto in Canada with my friends. We saw nightview in Toronto. It was a beautifull. And next day we went to Niagara falls. We heard that if you see the Niagara Falls you have to go Canada side. So we went to Canada Side and We could see wonderfull falls. We took picture and drove around by a car. Last We entered the casino. I didn t have a chance to visited casino. Sometime We won but usually we lost money. It was a good experience to us. It was fun. After that We invited Buffalo by Min kyu s friend. We had a great time in Buffalo. At night we moved in Pittburgh. This trip was very tired but we looked many things and studied Canada.
