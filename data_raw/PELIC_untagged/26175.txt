Dear SAND I deeply perceive your contradictory thought. I couldn't tell you what you should do right now. Because love is the most amazing feeling in every one's heart. You might look like a moody woman when you fell in love with a guy. The first moment when you see him you feel so happy and excited. Perhaps the next moment you could feel sad or anxious. Therefore go ahead and you should tell your boy friend that you love him. You see he told you that you should visit him. It is obvious that he cares about you. In addition please don't worry about your current job . You can find a new job in Minnesota or you could take a long vocation to get along with him without quitting your job. Money is not important at present. If he never love you at one day it means nothing to you and he never know how precious you are from begining to the end .
