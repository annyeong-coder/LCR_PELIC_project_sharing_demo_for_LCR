In January this year my friend and I went to buy car. The car dealer showed us to many cars with different prices according to the make mileages and year of the car. Then he showed us what he called his special one's. My friend bought one of them. It was an American car. The car was five years old and has hundred and twenty thousand miles on it. Two week after the car started causing problems. The dealer who knows the car should have told us the car engine has problem before we buy it. In another hand I could have advised him to always buy a Japanese used car. Now the car engine is out of service and he might have returned the car earlier to the dealer. We are still worried about his money. Should we have hired a lawyer and take the case to court or what Anyway he lost his money and we shouldn't have bought that car.
