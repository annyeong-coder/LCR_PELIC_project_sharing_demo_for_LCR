My Friend ANON_NAME_0 The friendship is very important to my. I have a lot of friends but they don't have the same stature in my heart. For example I have a friend who is ANON_NAME_0. He is very close to me. However we had never seen each other since we graduated from University. One day I went conference on London. Fortunately while I was sitting in coffee shop I saw him in the same coffee. We were surprised. When we were talking about our life I asked him what were you doing in London . He said he was staying with his brother while he was receiving his medication in the hospital at London. Then I decided to stay with him for while. After that I moved to my home.
