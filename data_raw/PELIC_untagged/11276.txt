If I can become an Olympic athlete I'll select soccer. Because this event is very popular on the world. It's simple but not easy when we play. A soccer player must use the ball influence and they control that. Soccer players is required strong and heigh before they're invite to play a team. Ater that they'll be guide by a coach and they'll be improve their ability. I like that because I think it very interesting.
