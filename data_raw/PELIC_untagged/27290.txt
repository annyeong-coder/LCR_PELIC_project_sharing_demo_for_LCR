Ready children She glanced at her watch. Yes! Answered the children. At the same time William started running suddenly. Where are you going Where are you going You'll miss the precious time! Said other children. While it happened Margot was sitting in the narrow closet. There was no emotion on her face which was able to figure out what she thought but her fists were clenched as a rock and also as if they forgot how to move. Margot felt that appearance of the sun had started because she saw a slight straight bright line between an opening in the drawer. Despite the yearning moment she closed her eyes. At that time the closet hissed open and there was a boy there. Margot couldn't know who he was because of the backlight. A boy turned around toward the window which he could see the sun and also Margot's eyes faced that window. Seven more years asked William. Yes Margot. Seven more years. . . . Seven more years. . . They were enchanted by the sun and standing for a while without a word. The voices which other children were romping were heard through that window.
