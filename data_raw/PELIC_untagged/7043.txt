I absolutely agree with this statement. In any relationship I think belief is the most valuable consideration in our society. Human can't live without coordination with other people or communities. So there is no one who doesn't have any role in a community or organzation in these days. Therefore People who need to cooperate with other person have to make him or her believe themselves by telling the truth. Of course some people who have little different opinion disagree this consideration. They believe that we have to often lie to other people for maintaining their relationship. The reason is that if I have some secret I don't want to tell them not to give a disappointment. For example I have a friend who really want to know news of his husband. They really loved each other but during the war the husband died. I already know it but I can't tell her he died because if I said this true she shocked very much. However in my opinion it is not good for her. Don't tell the truth make her wait hime until she will die. Every people have a right what they know the truth.
