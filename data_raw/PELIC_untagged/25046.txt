I went to sore yesterday because I needed to bought something. When I was in store I bought a lot of food and I bought little rice for diner and I bought a few chicken. After that I walked several miles to CVS. In the CVS I took many carton of nab ken and I took a great deal of salt. I asked a cashier about beans because I needed a lot of beans but the cashier said me I did not have.
