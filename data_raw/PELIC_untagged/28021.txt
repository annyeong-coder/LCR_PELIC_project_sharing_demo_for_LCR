Real friends Everyone needs friends who can accompany them whenever they feel happy and sad I am no exception. I have many friends however few of them can be my real friends. In my view real friends are people who not only cheer up their friends but never turn their friends down while friends are in trouble. There is an old saying goes A friend in need is a friend indeed which explains what real friends are. I remember that I used to be a student who didn't pay much attention on learning. Some of my friends helped me out to overcome the difficulties. We talked homework over together and looked it up again and again until the exam came to an end. In addition real friends whose suggestions always waken their friends up even these opinions may hurt someone. If friends are real friends they will tell their friends the truth and give them advice. I think that truth is like bitter medicine which makes people hardly take it but it is useful for me to think it over and make a right decision. I was satisfied with everything and then one of my friends reminded me to study further not march on the spot. These words from her which make me unacceptable at first but I found that there are many colleagues who learn something after coming off work therefore I realized that learning is endless. I feel lucky that I have real friends who are always by my side to go through everything. Although we can't meet very often but I know they will show up when I need them. That is what we called real friends.
