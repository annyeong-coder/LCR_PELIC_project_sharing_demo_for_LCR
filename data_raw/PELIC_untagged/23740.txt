A friends in need is a friend indeed. I agree with this proverb that make me think about friends. I think this proverb means that friends whom can help me when I need them are real friends. When I was in Korea I have had a lot of friends who hang out with me. When I was in difficulty which was a personal problem some people who just know me don't care about it. However some friends who are really best friends wanted to share my feeling about problem that make me tired. Also I hope I want to be real friends whom can help anytime for them. And I thank real friends whose friendship is good.
