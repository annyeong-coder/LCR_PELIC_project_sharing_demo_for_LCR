letter to editor I was really disappointed as many of the Post Gazette's readers when we found DVD attached with the newspaper this Sunday. That DVD was talking about Islam and it was being showed as a part of Nazism or Radical Islam as mentioned . I am worried that way of ad for political issue about the relationship between all religions or even between people as human being. I hope and I am quite sure that all readers can see the truth from the real life without any unfair influences from the media.
