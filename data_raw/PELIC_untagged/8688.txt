Talking about friendship is difficult because each person has a unique personality. For example I don't think a friend has to be a person who talks to you every day. My two best friends are living in different countries than me and they understand why I can't call there frequently and my inability to stay in touch. Today the internet is a technology which helps decrease distances but living in America changes your life. I don't have time to use the internet many hours during my day so in my opinion a good friend is someone who understands me and respects my choices. Brazil is a country where friendship is important and usually when we have a friend he or she can be your friend for the rest of your life. Brazilians think a friend is someone who always tells the truth and accepts you the way you are. They expect that you have the same feelings about them. Since I moved to America I have made new friends. Having friends cheers me up when I am feeling depressed and alone. I think I am a lucky person because first of all I have my best friend with me. My husband is a friend who is supportive and cares about me. He helps me when I am having trouble like for example helping me to learn English. My parents taught me treasured things about friendship. They told me that a friend is a person who we need to keep in our heart and I agree totally. People whose friends are supportive are lucky people. When you have friends you are not alone.
