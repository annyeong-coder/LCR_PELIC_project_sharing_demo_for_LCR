Hi I'm Elian Last Name . I've been working on my website for almost one year when I started to use it was confusing but at the time that I started to use it frequently it was getting easier. The things that you can do in my website are write me messages and make comments in the pictures that I upload. Since I came to Pittsburgh I have been uploading pictures of my and my friends here in this city and all the places that we have been visiting . My best friend told me that she's been watching all the pictures and she thinks that Pittsburgh is amazing! Well I think my website is safe and is fun but only the people that I am able to add are the only ones that can see all my pictures and messages. I'm still working in my website and I check my messages all days to be in contact with my friends.
