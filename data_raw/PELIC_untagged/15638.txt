When I planned the schedule to Hawaii last December my intuition was telling me that it was better to get on an early flight when I started. As I didn't want to start so early morning I decided to get on the second flight. However my flight was suddenly canceled before just boarding because of technical problems. So I had to stay two nights in the Hotel in Pittsburgh. If I had got on the earlier flight I would have arrived to Hawaii on Christmas day. I wish I could have met President elect Obama in Hawaii on Christmas day. Also I heard my inner voice that I should bring some foods. But I avoid carrying foods because my husband had a tendency too much eating. Unfortunately the first night in the Hotel in Hawaii was power failure because of thunderbolt and all restaurants or stores were closed. If I had had some foods I would never have felt hungry. I should follow to my intuition because my schedules in Hawaii did not work as planned.
