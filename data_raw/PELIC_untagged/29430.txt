As a young student I was reluctant to learn a new language. After the firsT English class my point of view was changed. I felt learning English would be my best hobby. Upon graduating from high school I determined to major in English. I spent four years studying English at the university without practicing. One day lying on the sofa watching an American movie I decided to retain learning English but from native speakers. Coming to the USA I achieved the first goal which is studying English then teaching English as a second language.
