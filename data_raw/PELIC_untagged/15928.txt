Health care should be provided by the governments Healthcare is very important for everyone. Therefore all governments should provide healthcare because healthcare costs are very high and contribute to decreasing and controlling the spread of diseases. Healthcare costs are very high which means there are many families that cannot pay these costs. This is one of the factors that helps to spread disease. In this case governments should provide healthcare. For example there are many big families that cannot pay health cost and some families have one or more sick members therefore the cost are very high. In my country the government provide healthcare I believe that there is no body thinking about the health costs. In addition if the government provides healthcare it will make a major contribution to controlling the spreading of diseases because it will offer free medicine for every body who is sick I believe that will be help to reduce diseases. Also immunizations are a very important thing that governments should offer for free. The governments should be provide the health care to avoid many health problems and make control for many diseases. Also the governments should offer all of the hospitals equipments.
