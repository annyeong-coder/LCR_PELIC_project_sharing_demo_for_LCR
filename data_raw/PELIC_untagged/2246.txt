Paragraph1 I used to live in China for a long years. I used to study with my friends. We always used to play and watch movie together. I used to take bus in China. I often used to play computer games before. Paragraph2 Today I am living in Pittsburgh and attending the University of Pittsburgh. I am used to studying English but it is hard for me now. I want to learn more English in ELI. Maybe my English is good little by little after.
