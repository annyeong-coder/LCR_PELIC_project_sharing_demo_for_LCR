If you have a plan to visit my city I advice you to go to see the oldest castle which was built by the Sassanid 1700 years ago . You can go to see the ancient building its name ALMASMAK. Then you can go to see the most interesting island in the east province . There are alot of things to see such as a fountain where it considers the tallest fountain in the middle east. You can go to the most exciting resort and have alot of fun there. Go and have great time in the biggest amusement park in my city. The best view you can see it if you go to the paradise park. I do not forget to tell you that my city considers the cleanest city in the Gulf.
