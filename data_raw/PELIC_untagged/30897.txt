My wife and I are waiting for our first baby so we try to figure out the things that we should do before her deliver. Picking out a baby bed is the first thing in our list then we will put up some cartoon pictures on the wall. Obviously we have to paint the room but first it is better if we figure out whether the baby is male or female then we can pick out an appropriate color.
