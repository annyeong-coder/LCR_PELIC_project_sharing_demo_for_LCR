Daniel A. Going to the military service could be a good experience for many people since it can give us many values and tools that would help us in several situations in our life. Moreover if our nation needs our service just because someone or another country is invading our sovereignty it would be almost a moral obligation for us. Many times this mandatory military service is a need for the future of our country. We cannot allow that evil people such as terrorist attack and kill many innocent people. In Colombia there is a civil war that has produced many murders such as politicians priest foreigners children and soldiers. In this conflict has been involved the Colombian guerrilla paramilitaries drug dealers corrupt politicians and socialist governments from other countries as the Venezuela's administration and the Ecuador's administration. As a result Colombian's government has done this service a duty for all Colombian youth. Therefore there are two reasons that can justify this mandatory military service such as the values that we can get in this service the moral responsibility that we have to defend our country from terrorists.
