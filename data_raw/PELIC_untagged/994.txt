October 16 2006 Dear zhong I recently want to buy a new laptop. I looked over a lot of information about laptop on computer. I think there are two kinds of laptops are suitable. They are Toshiba and Dell . I want to purchase Toshiba but I really can't decide. First the display of Toshiba is 14 play screen. On the other hand the display of Dell is 17 play screen. So the Toshiba is smaller and lighter than the Dell . Second the driver of Toshiba is VCD DVD burn . In contrast the driver of Dell is DVD CD burn . I think the VCD driver is more useful to me because the movies that I brought from china were all VCDs. Last the most important reason if I purchase Toshiba I can receive a rebate about 150. It made the price of Toshiba lower than the price of Dell . I only spend 650 on it. Do you think my choice is right Can you give me some advices about this Miss you! Love
