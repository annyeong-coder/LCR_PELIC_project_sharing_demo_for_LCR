An enviromental problem that is some how related to my country is the environmental pollution. Since libya is an oil country many oil spills happen because an old oil tankers are used to ship the oil these oil spill cause the death of many marine animals and the beachs pollution. This year the goverment in my country will front 20 millon dollar to improve the oil industry. I hope this action will eliminate the enviromental problems in my country.
