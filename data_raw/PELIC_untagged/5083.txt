THINGS WE CAN LEARN FROM STUDYING THE PAST I think there are many things that we can learn from studying the past. Whit the continuo studies that the scientists are making we can know how the people lived years ago. How were they clothes. What kind of nutrition they had. Also scientists had discovered other things that never we could imagine for example The Statues of Easter Island. Archaeologists made studies of the statues in the island and the people living on Easter Island today. And discovered many things about the ancient people and the statues in this island like there are more than 800 statues but more than 300 of them are unfinished. The people in the island knew very few about their past. Other studies is about The Nazca Lines that is in southwestern Peru there are many theories about this place but the most important is the Maria Reiche she began studying the lines mathematically and now scientists have more reasonable ideas the Nazca Lines. Now we can know that human have lived in this place for more 12000 years and that the people used the lines and pictures in ceremonies or dances for to get the attention of their gods. These are only few examples the things that we can know whit investigation that Archaeologists scientists etc. Made for to know more about our past.
