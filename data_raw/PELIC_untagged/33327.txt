My friend and I created a time capsule on June 16 2012. We buried it under a very old tree in my grandfather's house. The capsule contains 10 items. These 10 items will tell the people who in the future about our life. For example some plates two forks two knives two spoons and two chopstickshow're show them how we eat. A few menus to show what we eat. Some pictures to show how we look like and what we wear for daily life. A lot of post card to show where we live and how is our house look like. A lot of letters to show what kind of language we use and what we write about. A little money to show what we use for our business. Three bottles of coffee to show what most people like to drink. When they open this capsule they will know us easily and get interesting about us.
