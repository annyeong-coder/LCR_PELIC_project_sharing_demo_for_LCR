I've already hung the balloons but I haven't wrapped the gift yet. I've already bought flowers but I haven't vacuumed the carpet yet. I've already baked the cake but I haven't bought the candles yet. I've already set the table but I haven't cut up the vegetables yet. I've already put the turkey in the oven but I haven't mopped the floor yet.
