The cause of happiness Abraham Lincoln one of the great presidents in American history said Most people are about as happy as they make up their minds to be. It is possible that people would be happy when they decide to be happy. In many cases happiness depends on one's mind except the case of those who suffer from lack of serotonin which is believed to make one feel happy and confident. Happiness is said to be an object and there is no one who doesn't want to be happy. However a human being is not a simple organism. Some people who have everything such as money job and even the loved ones sometimes kill themselves. Therefore happiness doesn't seem to come from external conditions. In contrast others commit suicide because they have nothing! No money no place to live and no family. In this society where physical things are attributed to be most important condition of happiness people try to enhance their standard of living and they will be unhappy if they can't succeed in doing it. What is the underlying cause of happiness Maybe Lincoln's words are right. Happy people say that regardless of property and having family they are happy because they decide to be happy. Moreover Beob ANON_NAME_0 one of the most famous Buddhist monks in Korea and dead a few months ago said that may every living thing be happy by doing its best in living and by feeling alive. It seems that effort to be happy is an inherent part of happiness.
