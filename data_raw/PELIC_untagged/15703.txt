There are many things in ELI make me feel good. The students in ELI come from diffierent countries we come here in order to improving our English . So I feel so good that I can make friends from diffierent culture and learn their customs. Everyone in the class are very friendly which contribute to me adjust to an alien environment so quickly. The teacher in ELI always talk something over native life which lead us to find out the diffierence between cultures and they always give our homework or paper back in time. That what makes me feel good. However there are something make me feel not comfortable. I know the teacher are foucus on building language system up so we always have many quizes and tests. When we learn something new we don't have enough time to figure it out. I hope teachers can cut quizes down and bring skills trian up. I know the ELI keep on tring to improvr I belive the teacher will touch class up and take off the disadvantages.
