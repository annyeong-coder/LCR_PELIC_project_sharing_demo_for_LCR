The view from my window The view from my window takes me to another world. When I look from my window I see many people from other countries. The Chinese people enter Best Buy and they exit from the market with two bags one on the right hand and the other on the left hand. The American people and Spanish shop in Wal Mart and always the shopping cart is full with many different things. Also I can see my farm and in the middle there are some different trees. The cow and sheep eat some grass. The cat runs around the farm and sometime I see the cat play with the sheep. When I see the red apple and strawberry on the apple trees and strawberry trees I feel in healthy position. In front of my farm the mechanic fixes and helps the people whose car is broken. In the other side of this station the cleaning man who washing cars always feels cold because his clothes are wet. In conclusion I feel very happy when I look from my window because the Americans Spanish's and Chinese's people pets and all supermarkets around my eyes are feeling me in another world.
