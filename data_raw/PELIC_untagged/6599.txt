In these days we can see people who are working anywhere. I think you are also one of them even if you don't earn any money. Have you ever think why they are working hard In fact nowadays if we don't have enough money we couldn't maintain our comfortable lives. However I think it's not all people who are working also have others reasons to work in their lives. In my opinion there are three reasons that people work to get money to realize their dream to help poor people. The first reason is to get money. Actually I feel it's the most important reasons of working. There are a lot of things that we live in a this period such as food clothes houses etc. However there are no free in this society even though those are essential in our lives. So if we want to get something that people need we should pay suitable money for getting those. Therefore people have to work to live. The second reason every people have their own dream and they want to realize their dream.
