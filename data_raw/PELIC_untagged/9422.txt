My family I am living with my husband and my son who is 21 months old years in Pittsburgh. My husband works at University of Pittsburgh as a postdoctral. He researches about the organic chemistry at Chemistry department. I also studied the chemistry when I went to the university. So we can talk about his researches and I can understand about his jobs. Before my son was born I also worked in the pharmaceutical company as a researcher. Now I have to take care my son. He is little boy. Recently he can speak some words. He speaks both languages Japanese and English. For example he calls Head however he calls MIMI that means the ear in Japanese. I think that he chooses words that he can speak easily. My husband and I are interested in this phenomenon.
