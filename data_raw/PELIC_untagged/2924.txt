What are the three most important things in life and why The most three important things of my life are family life friends' relationship and career. I grew up in a lovely family. All of the members of my family are humble and honest. My parents are conceded our family education more than school grade. Thus keeping well relationship between us is one of the most significant issues of my family even though we do not live together. As I know many siblings of a family have a big competition to each other but among our siblings we don't have any competition during our school education. In other hand each of our siblings is as a back up to each one. So if someone gets trouble others would do they best to help to him her. For example I am here U. S. A. And applying schools. When I need a lot of something I always ask my sibling to help me to look for me they always put them in the first priority. Moreover I have had a lot of friends who helped me during my life. I think without their help I could not do as much as I can and have a pleasant school life and enjoyable worked experiences. For instance when first day I came here I felt a little anxious to be here. My friend who picked me up at airport gave me a lot of suggestions how to live here. Now I can survive here. Thus the friendship is very important thing for me in my life. Furthermore a successful career is indispensable to my life. It is not only for making a lot of money but also something to contribute your family society and community. So that is why I am continuing to learn and update my knowledge of my filed. I wish one day I can be a successful person in my career. To sum up everyone has his own important thing in one's life. For me the family life friends' relationship and career are most important things in my life without of them I may feel my life is empty.
