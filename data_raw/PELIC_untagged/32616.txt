So people are concerned today about these topic which have a great impact on children. In turn we do see nowadays many of parents have various opinions regarding this issue. Even though many people think that living growing children in big cities is better I think it is much better to raise children outside big cities because it is good to keep the cultural identity for children in future plus the fact that living in countryside is healthy. Cultural identity is lost in big cities. Since big cities have usually multicultural societies they eventually follow the melting pot rules in which people lose their inherited cultures and values. So that seems that our life will be boring because we will not see cultural differences in the world in the next generations. Cultural differences are somethings nice in our lives making this world exciting by knowing new culture every day. If we want keep this thing in the next generation we have to raise kids in places located far away from big cities to be sure that they will not lose their cultural identities.
