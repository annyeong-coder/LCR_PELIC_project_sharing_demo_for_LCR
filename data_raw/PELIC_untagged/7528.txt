I have never been to abroad except the U. S. So when I came to the U. S I find a lot of difference between Japan and US. I compare these two country from the three point of view that is the size food and people. When I arrived to the airport in US I was surprised that every thing I see in America is 'Big . All of things such as bottle of milk coffie cup handle of door automobile some electronic product. They look so tough simple and reliable. Compared to the U. S. In Japan all things is small fine and reliable. The impression of U. S. Is tough big and simple. It is apparently that the food is different between Asian country and Western country. There are a lot of differences in these two countries the material the way of cooking etc. But one of the most surprising thing is that the variety of foods in US. Certainly Japanese foods have been influenced by many countries such as China India U. S. Etc. But In America which accept large number of immigrant from many countries various kinds of foods from many country get popularity and some of them have became as if they are traditional American foods. There are a lot of restaurants of each country in the U. S. It was amazing for me and I was envy this situation every day. Last issue is the people. The first impression of American people is friendly . Japanese never said Hello to strangers. I already know about this but it annoyed me at first because I don't know how I answer to this greeting. But when I used to this custom I think this is an attractive habit of American People. There are a lot of differences in these two countries. But I am going to enjoy it.
