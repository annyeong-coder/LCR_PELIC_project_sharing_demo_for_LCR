In May 2003 I volunteered to work in a local hospital for two months and part of my job was assisting is developing a database for Cardiovascular Department with a team consisted of twelve members. Patient's right and education had always been my first interest so I assigned to work on it with ANON_NAME_0 who was an IT student at that time. We were motivated to work together in such project and as I used to help him understand the medical terminology he helped me improve my IT skills. Our project was the second winner over all of the nine projects presented by the students. We had many prizes but becoming a friend with ANON_NAME_0 was the true prize in that special summer.
