I have lived in the Uzbekistan for one year. I went there for MD doctor of medicine . I came back in summer vacations and decided not to go back in Uzbekistan and got admission in Margalla Institute of Health Sciences MIHS in Pakistan. I have been playing table tennis and badminton in MIHS for 4 years. I have won 1st prize in all consecutive 4 years in both games. I have not been playing table tennis and badminton since I came in U. S. I have completed my first term in the School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences.
