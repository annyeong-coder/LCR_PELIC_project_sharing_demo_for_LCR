My name is FOUAD. I want to tell everybody about learning English in the U. S. First I've been studying English in the ELI. I finished level 3 last semesters. I've studying full time in the ELI because it is better to learn English very fast. Second in ELI I met a lot of people from different countries. It is a good way to learn English or another language. Then our teachers have taught me how can learn English very fast. For example when I came there in the U. S I couldn't speak English very good . Now I spoke English better then when I came here. So I have known ANON_NAME_0 for long time. She was good teacher in the ELI. She taught me reading class in full 2008 when I came to ELI. Also she is teaching in ELI level 3 4 and 5. After that she's taught me Grammar class. If you want to learn English you have to come to U. S. In addition I've lived in the U. S for one year. I moved to Pittsburgh last year. I met a lot of students and teachers from ELI and ELS in point Park. I've been living there since I had scholarship from my country. I've known my advisor since 2007.
