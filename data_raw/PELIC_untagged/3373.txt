According to this article the author mentions the restricting choice is one of the creativity killers. Thus the idea education should follow the students' interests. Basing on this concept there might have a test or a questionnaire to make sure every student's interests. After know their interests directors can gather the students who have the same interests in the same class and focus on teaching and creating their interests. For example they may have more classes on their interests or they can manage that class in the final class of a day. If they manage their interesting in the final class students will have more time to engage in their subject or discuss questions with their teacher without time limit. This also can respond to another author's opinion that adult shouldn't stop children's activity when they still have interested in it. Besides which mentions above in an idea education there shouldn't have too many over controls and evaluations. Not every class should be like that but some classes which with creativity should follow this rule. Take the art lesson for example. If the teacher wants students to make a lantern the teacher can introduce and teach students how to make a lantern there might have several ways to make it. The teacher shouldn't ask students use specific materials or ways to make a lantern. Instead the teacher should encourage students to think if there are other materials which can also make a lantern. After students finish their lanterns the teacher shouldn't depend on his or her personal values to give the grades. In the student's opinion his lantern is very beautiful however the teacher might think it's not beautiful at all and give him a low grade. This could block the student's enthusiasm and stop their interests in it. Thus we shouldn't over control and evaluate students' activity and performance in some classes.
