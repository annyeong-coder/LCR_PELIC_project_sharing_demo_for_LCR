There are several different frameworks between taking public transportation and driving our own cars. First of all we need to get a driving licence for driving our cars but taking public transportation doesn't need it. Unlike taking public transportation we should pay lots of fees for registration insurance or parking. Moreover we have to check our car regularly however we don't care about it if we take public transportation. On the other hand we share buses or subways with the public we can own our cars. While we are able to change the direction by ourselves with our own cars we can't choose it in public transportation.
