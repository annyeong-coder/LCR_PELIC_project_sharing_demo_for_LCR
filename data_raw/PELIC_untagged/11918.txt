In my opinion the most famous person is the great king Se Jong. In my country we had many kings but we called the great king just two person. Se Jong is one of them. The other one is Gwangkaeto the king of the Go gu ryeo. By the way Se Jong is the 4th king of the Jo Seon period. I think the most important achieve ment is Korean. We used to use Chinese befor he made Korean. Some countries have their languages so having our language is our proud. There fore the Great King Se Jong is the most important and famous person in my opinion.
