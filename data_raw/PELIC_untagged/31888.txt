Actually It would be difficult to live without technology especially we have depended on it since it was introduced. Nowadays people use technology as a part of their lives. In other words if one technological system i. E. WWW broke down life would be more stressful. Nevertheless there are still some people can do without technology maybe due to religous beliefs or asceticism For me it seems unusual when I do not carry cell phone because most of my work is done on my phone. For example checking my e mail and online banking tansactions are done via my cell phone. Technology has made our life easier in many different fields such as science medicine and education. Take education students are absorbed in their study thanks to technology. Medically doctors perform operations using virual reality so they can discover what is going on in someone's abdomen before starting the operation. Unfortunately there are some disadvatages of technology use. Some people abuse technology by hacking into other's computers or bank accounts. Those people are likely to be arrested because of their crime. Afterall we assume that we cannot do without technology despit of such drawbacks but we hope to see more reasonable use of Technology.
