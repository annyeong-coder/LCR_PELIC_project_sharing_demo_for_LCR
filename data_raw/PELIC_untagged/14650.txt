The article A chimp Off the Old Block talks about a young chimp who has proved himself to have literary skills. Researchers at the Kyoto University Primate Research Institute in Japan taught a 25 year old chimp called Ai how to read several characters of kanji a form of written Japanese. However it was Ayumu Ai's young son who surprised the researchers. Although he had never been taught how to read he showed that he could match the kanji word for brown with a brown square at the computer monitor which Ai used for learning. According to the article the researchers think that Ayumu taught himself while watching his mother learn and they will let him keep learning only by observing his mother.
