I have many happy childhood memories. I remember how my mother took care of me. She is a fantastic woman and an admirable person for her values. I remember how my mother prepared us delicious dishes. My mother who is a great cook makes me very happy with her terrific dishes. Dishes that had been prepared with love. She spent a lot of time in the kitchen trying to create new recipes that we waited for with much happiness. She is the number one mother in the world. Also I remember that we went to a beautiful park where we played games. We always have been her major happiness and she our major treasure. My mother painted our lives with happiness and love. She spent much of her life making us responsible and passionate human beings. For instance my mother went over the homework that our teacher assigned us. I have beautiful childhood memories thanks to the fact that I have the most intelligent and sweetest mother of the universe. My childhood was made a fantastic experience by my mother whom I remember with grattitude.
