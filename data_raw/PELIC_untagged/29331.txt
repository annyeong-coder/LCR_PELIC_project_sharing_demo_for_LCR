When I had to choose my major in philosophy many people told me their opinion about this crucial decision. I believe that if I had listened to the opinion of my classmates I would never have enjoyed the pleasures of thinking in a philosophical way. On the other hand if I had followed the opinion of my aunt Zoraida which was that I should study business neither would I have had the opportunity of exploring the magical world of philosophy. Also my brother Yair told me that I should become a successful businessman but again if I had taken his suggestion I wouldn't have found the happy road of philosophy. However I wish I had wanted to combine my studies about philosophy with studies about cooking. Also I wish I could have had a lot of money to organize an enormous library about cooking and philosophy. I think that when you take a crucial decision in life you should be attentive to the inner voice that tells the truth always. I listened to my daimon inner voice in Greek and I am happy with my decision. I wish to continue working very hard in my field which offers me wonderful experiences.
