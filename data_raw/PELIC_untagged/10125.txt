The most interesting experience I have ever had with money happened last year when I went to a traditional market with my mother. First we stop at a vegetable booth to buy some vegetables. When we would check out my mother found that there was just few coins in her wallet and I did not have any money with me. My mother's money was not enough to pay for the vegetables. She just told the vendor she forgot to bring money. The vendor said It is ok! You can take these vegetables home first and give me money tomorrow. Besides he also lent us NT 1 000 to buy other stuff. He was familiar to my mother because my mother almost buys vegetables at his booth everyday. I thought he believed my mother was not a dishonest person or he would not lend her any money. However I still felt so embarrassed at that time especially a lot of people were looking at us.
