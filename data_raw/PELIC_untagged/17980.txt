We can challenge the culture shock by visiting good places. First we have to visit musuams zoo and parks to refresh our activities. Also we can go shopping to see new things that help us to make some good idea. In addition we can spend every weekend to visit new cities closed to our city. Finally the culture shock is not big problem if we go outside and see good places to study the culture.
