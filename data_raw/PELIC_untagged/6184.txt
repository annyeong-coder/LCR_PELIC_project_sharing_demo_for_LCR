I respect a physicist of stephen hawking. He was born on January 8 1942 in Oxford England. When he was 20 he had a serious sickness. So he was not able to move his body without weelchair but he did not stop his study. He was able to experiment. Even if he lost the ability to speek and cound not move anything did not stop his an experiment. Finally he can accomplish through challenge.
