PERSONAL LETTER Oct. 16 2006 Dear So Young I want to buy an mp3 player. I keep in mind tow kind of mp3 players. One kind of mp3 player is bigger than another mp3 player. First Big mp3 player can play movies but small mp3 player can't play movies. I like movies so if I buy big mp3 player I'll see movies in anyplace. Second small mp3 player is lighter than big mp3 player so if I buy small mp3 player I'll get the mp3 player in anyplace. Two kind of mp3 player is different. So I worried but I chose big mp3 player because I love movies. How do you think about choose How is your mp3 player I think you must have mp3 player so I want to know about your mp3 player.
