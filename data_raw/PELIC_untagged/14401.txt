I am at Elephant Rock Beach. It is cold right now but the scene is still beautiful. The sky is not clear. There are a lot of black clouds floating. The air is humid. I think it is going to rain. The ocean is very big. You can't see the end. Because it is windy waves are very big. The waves hit the rocks once and again. When they hit a huge rock you will hear a very big noise and you also can see a lot of huge white water. I am convulsed by it. I like standing here because I can relax but too late I need go back.
