The twins Jim Springer and Jim Lewis do not only have the same name. Although they have never met each other before they have so many similarities that it seems unbelievable. The fact that the brothers look exactly the same have the same height weight voice sound and characters traits is amazing but understandable. The more interesting thing is that as children they each had a dog named Toy they had the same hobby woodworking now they use the same expressions and both have worked part time in law enforcement. However the most incredible fact is that they were married to women with the same name and named theirs sons similarly! Jim Springer was first married to a woman named Linda and then to a woman named Betty which happened to Jim Lewis as well. Jim Springer named his son James Allen Jim Lewis named his son James Alan. Being similar brothers could feel each other. Until they were reunited each had felt emptiness as though something was missing from his life. It is wonderful that the identical twins finally met each other.
