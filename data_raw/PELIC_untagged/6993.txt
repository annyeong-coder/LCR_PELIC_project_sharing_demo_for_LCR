When I finish the ELI program in America I might travel some countries in europe and may visit my cousin's house in LA. After then I'm going to go back to Korea. Next year I will be senior in Yong In university. Since I am good at Judo and very interested in presidential bodyguard I will prepare to be a presidential security agent. I might apply for that before I graduate. As soon as I get a job I will marry my girlfriend. I might try to have two children son and daughter. After retirement I may go back my hometown and take over my father's business.
