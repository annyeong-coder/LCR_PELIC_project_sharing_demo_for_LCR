Gambling is game in which a player uses money to bet their cards. It can let them have fun and win money but also it can kill them and their families. Gambling has many kinds of games and is very exciting but the point is that we have to control ourselves. We must control ourselves when we gamble. There are many kinds of gambling games. Some use cards some use dice and some just put money in the machines and play. For example big old two 13cards and poker use cards. One game named sibala uses dice. Pinball and 777 use machine. I think Las Vegas has the most gambling machines in the world. It's a good place for gambling. I play poker with my friends almost every week. One good thing is good that we all know how to control ourselves. For example we don't spend a lot of money when we play poker. Each time we play we just spend twenty to thirty dollars and we never borrow money to play. One of my friends told me We just play for fun and we are all good friends so winning a lot of money from friends makes me feel bad. Some of my friends in Taiwan don't know how to control themselves. For example they borrow a lot of money from a bank or other friends when they lose a lot but they keep playing. After that they can't give it back so they have to borrow some money from others. The situation keeps like this so when they can't give the money back they have to hide themselves because the person who borrow them money will hurt them. Now still have many people get hurt when they can't give the money back. They ended their lives and no one can take care of their families. The problem can become more and more. Gambling is very exciting but the point is that we have to control ourselves. Reference My friend Michael said. 06
