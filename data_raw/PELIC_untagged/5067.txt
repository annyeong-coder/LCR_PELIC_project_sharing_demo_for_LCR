Don't tell white lies. People usually think many things in their ways. Several years ago Internet chatting is very popular in my country and every young people like college students used it to get a chance to meet somebody. At first it was good for young people but soon they realized that every person has their own standards. In my friend's case she met someone on line and thought he was very nice guy. He told her that he was a good looking man and many things in his way. One day they met each other and my friend was shocked. He was shorter than my friend and too skinny. I don't think he really thought he is handsome. Do spend time getting to know someone on line. I really don't think it is a good idea because the more time the more expectation. People are usually imagining someone they meet on line because they can't see each other. So they have to rely on letters from their dates and expectation may be growing. One day they meet each other and were easily frustrated. And there was even a song about a man who meets a dream girl on line in my country. The man loves her so much and dream about her every day. Finally they meet each other and the man run away. He expresses his feeling in this song and sometimes it really happens in my country.
