BORING WEEKEND There are a lot of things to do this weekend but Pittsburgh is so cold at these times. First of all I will do my homework on friday night because I don't want to think them anymore. Then I will watch movie in my home. It will be Tim Burton's movie. I am going to sleep on saturday morning until 1 pm. Than I am going to go to Sauth Side to meet my friends. We are going to go to Cheescake Factory. Maybe we can go to Giant Eagle for foods shopping. Probably the weather will be so cold so I will go back to my warm house. Next I will tidy my house. After I will use my computer and I will talk with my family on msn. I don't have any plan on Sunday because the weather is so cold at these days so I am lazy. Finally I love weekends but not in winter time. .
