Graduation is next month! I need to make plans now because when exams start I won't have any free time. What I will to do when I finish school My roommate will take a vacation before she will looks for a job. I can't do that because I need to earn some money soon. I think that after I graduate I will take a word processing class. As soon as I learn word processing I will look for a job as a bilingual office assitant. It's hard to find full time jobs though. Part time jobs are easier to find. Maybe I'll take a part time job after I find a good full time one. Or maybe I'll take a workshop in making decisions before I do anything!
