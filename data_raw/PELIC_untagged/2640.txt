The winter In the winter there are a lot of things that make me feel bleak and sad because of several reasons. After the snow fall the sky looks like dark and boring and also all the road getting dirty and you can't see the road so clear. The cars look like skiing in the black ice and a lot of accidents happen especially in this time of the year and there is nobody outside it's kind of bleakness city and emptiness from the people except those who are a homeless. The noon is very short and the sunset early and the dark become soon. The degrees temperature is very low and it's keep the people inside of there houses. They live in the roads look like some annual hibernation for some of the animal in the wild. You can't do. Everybody have to wear heavy clothes and the kids too. I feel bore and sad and the life is empty from anything likes the fun the movement here and there and its hard to travel by driving too. The tree is throwing its leaves and looks like it's exchanged the leaves with snow. It's really boring and sadness dark and scared views you can see it in this special time of the year weather during the winter.
