We can see the people who don't manage their time management effectively. How can we manage our time successfully First we have to make a plan effectually. Making a plan is the most important because it is the first step. If we nake a plan well we can keep relations well with our classmates. Also we have to excute the plan that we made. When I was high school I made an appointment with my father. The promise was that I had to manage time effectively. However I didn't keep on it with my father because I was lazy. My father who was strict treated me cruely. Even though I was sad I learned that excuting a plan is as impotant as making a plan. Moreover If you fail to manage time you must examine yourself. Effetive time management will help you improve your college life much better.
