Vaiety is the Spice of Life Variety or diversity is the source of everything on earth. That makes people see how the difference between them and another creature. In other word variety can be helpful to people when they begin to create anything. The ideas will be riches. Let's take another example in my personal experience of English study When I work with a classmate he corrects my mistikes that I cannot recognize by myself. Therefore when we make a discussion in class the diversity shows much kind thinking that seem ineresting. Finally vaiety can be helpful to make riches in our lifes.
