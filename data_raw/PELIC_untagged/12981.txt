I was bron in Xiaoyi China. It is a small town. There are a lot of coal in my hometown. My father was a coal miner. My mather was a Chinese teacher. They retired. I have a elder sister. She lives in Shanghai China. They love me very much. I love them too. I miss them. I and my wife came Pittsburgh in 2005. We like here. Here weather is as same as that of my homtown. We feel comfortable. We rent an one bedroom apartment. What's more my daughter was born this year. We are very happy. We enjoy our life!
