These two articles show the two different points of view of smokers Smoking in Public Live and Let Live and anti smokers Kicking Butt . In my opinion the second article differently from the first one leaves space also to a criticism of the anti smokers crusade even though it is clear how the author is against smoking. In Live and Let Live the argumentation is free of any kind of contradictory. Comparing the two articles I have noticed also a difference in the tone that makes the argumentation of Saletan stronger than the one of the author of Live and Let Live . In fact in this article the tone is more objective than in the other on the book and the thesis is supported by data and reasonings instead of only personal feelings and thoughts. About the similarities I think that notwithstanding the opinion of Saletan in his article we can notice a defense of the rights of smokers likewise what happens in Live and Let Live . A good example could be the last line of paragraph 5 of Kicking Butt .
