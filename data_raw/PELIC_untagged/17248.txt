I want to introduce a book that is called The decisive moment . Henry Cartier Bresson who is a French photographer wrote the book and it became a famous book that is read by everyone who is interested in photography in the history of photography. The reason that photos in the book are important is that he didn't use any artificial tool. He just used natural light whereas most recent photographers use artificial light such as speed light additional light sources. In addition he used a small camera that only has a few functions and only one lens. However most photographers can use advanced cameras extra equipment such as digital camera zoom lenses that have vast ranges. But it's still extremely hard to take a photo as he took with the tiny camera even though we have a good camera that has many functions. Most of all the scenes that the photos have show us an decisive moment which can happen but very rare in our ordinary life. He caught the moments that we casually miss and ignore. He said that he had been trying to take the photos that are in decisive moment but finally he recognized that every moment was decisive and important. He taught us how photos can work as an artwork and give us lessons.
