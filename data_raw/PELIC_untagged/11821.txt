Dear Peter Hello I'm Yeonjea attending your class. I'm sending this mail to ask something to you. I missed the class on Friday last week. And I would like to follow the class. Would you mind noticing me the assignment of that day I will send you the assignment at next class after I've done. Thank you. Sincerely yours Yeonjea.
