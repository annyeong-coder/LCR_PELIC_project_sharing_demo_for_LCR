Of English proverbs there is an expression Two heads are better than one. Considering my everyday's life I absolutely agree with this proverb. In every ELI class I am taking all teachers require us to do pair work. For example I solve some questions in a textbook by myself. When I finish solving the questions I believe my answers are all correct. However when I compare my answers with my partner's answers I can find or notice there are many mistakes in my answers. Through the process we can easily find all correct answers to the questions. If we cooperate each other there is no problem that we cannot figure out.
