My important thing about relationship is to understand each other personality. When I was college student I met my best friend. In gym class we had to make a pair. My best friend talked to me first. After we finished playing golf we talked a little bit. Then I understood her hobby was same of mine. We talked a lot of things about hobbies favorite foods and music every day. By eating foods together we knew each other very well.
