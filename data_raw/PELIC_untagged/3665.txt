When I was high school student I didn't study hard. So I couldn't enter a university which I really wanted to go. I should have studied hard so that I could enter the university. Actually I could have entered the university if I prepared one more year for the university. However I didn't want to study same books so I went to another school. At that time I just wanted to rest and graduated from my high school quickly. But I feel regretful now. I might have prepared one more year.
