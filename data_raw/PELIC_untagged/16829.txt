I met my friend Noorah while I was visiting Egypt last summer. It was a rainy day and I was looking for a hotel when I first saw her she was really pretty girl. Suddenly and when I was crossing the street she asked me to help her finding a hotel also then I started talking to her and knowing about her and then she became really good friend that I ask her for advise in every important thing in my life.
