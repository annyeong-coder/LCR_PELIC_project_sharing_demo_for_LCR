My classmates and I went kayaking last Wednesday. We started at the Allegheny River in front of PNC Park. While I was paddling my kayak I saw many things such as a duck's family a jet sky and motor boats. I sometimes stopped paddling because my arms were too tired. While I was floating on the river I saw many baby ducks. The baby ducks were swimming peacefully in a row. They were very cute. Then I started paddling the kayak again and I returned to the starting point. Kayaking was a very good experience but there was one problem. While I was paddling the kayak my skin was burned by sun. Now I have a painful sunburn. I think that my painful sunburn is going to be a pleasant memory.
