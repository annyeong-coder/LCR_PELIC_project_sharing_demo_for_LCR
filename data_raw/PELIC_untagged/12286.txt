Most people today have cell phones wherever they go. They usually use to contact for saying hello to familiar friends. Though cell phone has good points it also has some weak points for our health. Scientists increasingly research on a problem of cell phone for human's body recently. They found that electromagnetic fields EMFs could affect the central nervous and immune systems in man. According to Zhejiang 2005 results confirm that amplitude modulated radiofrequency radiation can induce responses in cells of nervous tissue origin from widely different animal species including humans. Researchers have also shown that low intensity microwave exposure opens up the blood brain barrier a biological effect which can allow the release of dangerous chemicals into the brain. As such the development of telecommunication altered our lives to be comfortable and abundant. On the other hand this is like the double edged sword that it presents many issues Reference ANON URLPAGE
