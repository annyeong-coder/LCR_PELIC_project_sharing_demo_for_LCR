In general most of us have neighbors but not all of us like their neighbors. ANON_NAME_0 1120 said see your new neighbors before buy your new house . Actually I completely agree with him because one of causes of your happy life in your house is the quality of your neighbors. I think the most important qualities which should your neighbors have are quite and helpful The first quality should your neighbors have is being quite. If you would like to be get rest or feel relax after a long hard day you should choose very quit place. That place should be your house. For instance My father who works as a teacher usually comes to home tired from the school once he arrive from his job he wants to get some rest. Unfortunately One of our neighbors has a garage beside his house most of time he creates thing by wood. That mean how you can make a wooden chair without any noise! After three years my father can stand this situation so he decided to buy anther house. After one year searching he found very expensive one but it is very quit. Last year I got a job in my currently company I get back home very tired in that time I just realized why my father bought anther house.
