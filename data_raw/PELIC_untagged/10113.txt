One month ago I went to Miami and Key west with my husband. We staysd Miami 2 days. We watched NBA game the Heats against the Spurs at the American Airlines Arena. We enjoyed the game. We stayed Key west 4 days. We went to Dry Tortugas National park as well. I was impressed with beautiful scenery in there. The ocean was awesome!It had blue clear water and lots of beautiful fishes and white sands. There were several people because people had to utilize boat or cessna to come there. As for my husband he didn't enjoy there too much because he got seasick when we came there. Anyway I spent great time.
