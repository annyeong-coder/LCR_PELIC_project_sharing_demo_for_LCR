They conducted survey and averaged three kind of profiles. The first profile reflected how volunteers rated their own personalities the second profile reflected how they rated the personalties of other individuals they knew and the third profile was reflecting how volunteers described a typical person from their culture which means national stereotype. Then the researchers compared the three profiles one another and investigate if there were any agreement between the national stereo type and what actually measured.
