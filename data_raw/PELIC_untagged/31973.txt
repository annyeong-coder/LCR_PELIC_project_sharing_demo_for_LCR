Wed Attllah Grammar 3G 2 20 12 Time Capsule 2010 On Feb. 1 2010 I created a time capsule and buried it under a tree in our garden. There were four significant items in the capsule which will tell people something about my current situation. For example I placed many individual pictures inside to tell people what I look like. If someone opened it 99 years from now then they can see what I look like . The second item I placed inside it was my favorite bracelet. I wanted to give someone an advantage of some sort maybe this bracelet will assist them in pass a hard time in their life. Also I placed a few copies of my nursing certificates inside to show my work experiences and to show them that I was a good nurse and I helped a lot of patients in my life. The fourth item I put in was my lovely iPod that will show a lot of our songs now. This is my time capsule I hope u like it.
