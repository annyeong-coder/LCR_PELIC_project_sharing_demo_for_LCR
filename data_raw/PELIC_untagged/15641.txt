Toefl is the biggest problem facing foreign students. That the universities in the USA require a high score in the Toefl . However we can found a good solution. We may make the foreign students study one short academic semester. For example if the student majored in geography he should study some classes in short academic term. If he succeed he can continues his study. But if he doesn't succeed he should takes English language coerce . I think this solution could offer time and help the foreign students
