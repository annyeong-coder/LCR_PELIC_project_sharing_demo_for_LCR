When I first read the quotation I didn't work it out and make a sence. Because according to my background knowledge which is about Confucius I have suspected the transcription which has or has not exactly translated the original meanings. I looked up the original Chinese sentence on the internet and looked into its original meanings. Then I found out that the meaning should have been Have no friends not have any better quality than you. This means every friend who you make will have a merit or a experience which you maybe don't have. You should learn the good from your friend. I go along with it. When I have studied English my friends and I have changed the learning experiences each other and we all have gotten helps which have helped us get ahead in English learning.
