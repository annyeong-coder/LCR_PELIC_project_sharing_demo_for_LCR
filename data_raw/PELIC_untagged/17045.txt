How to plan a vacation People invest a lot of time and money on vacation. How you spend your vacation time is also important to doing well at work. To have a great vacation there are a couple of important steps you should take beforehand. First of all you have to book for your flight and hotel. Usually you can get a better deal if you purchase them early. However most of low fare airplane tickets are non refundable so it's important to buy them after your schedule is confirmed. There are also some websites you can place your bid on. They won't announce their rates but they will accept your bid if it is more than the minimal amount they have set inside. Secondly you should research local restaurants and markets. We usually eat 3 meals a day. If you don't have many options you might end up eating the same food everyday. Also food is an important part of a culture. You will enjoy new food as well as the atmosphere of the local restaurants. In case you are not sure about the quality of the tap water you'd better drink bottled water because once you get sick you can't enjoy the rest of your vacation. Finally make a list of things you need to bring and start packing early. When you're in a hurry you tend to forget things. If you forget something necessary for your vacation such a camera you will have to buy it even though you already have one at home. Besides prices are usually higher at tourist attractions. It's very important to take some time off and refresh yourself. Plan ahead so you can enjoy your vacation better.
