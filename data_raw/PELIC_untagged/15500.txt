Let me introduce a square where a lot of doves are living. There are many people who give food to doves in the square. Actually I don't know that square's name but it should be famous place because looks very crowdy and safety. Behind the square there is a big building which is seems like mosk. I think there is very interesting place to those peaopl who are traveling there.
