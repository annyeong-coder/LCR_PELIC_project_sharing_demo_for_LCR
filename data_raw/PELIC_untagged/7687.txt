Activity such as swimming special food nice weather Some people might like winter another person might like fall but my favorite season is summer. There are many reasons to support my opinions. First of all I can do lots of water activities in this season. For example I enjoy relaxing by water I also can play water ball in the swimming pool. If another season you can't play water game such as winter. In addition I loves summer special fruit. For example I like to eat mango I also like to eat ice cream. If you eat ice cream in winter it might be cold. Finally I want to relaxing by beach the sunshine can makes my skin looking nice. My foot also can touch the small wave. If the winter time you can't touch the water by beach it makes you sick. All in all these reasons can tell you summer is my favorite season. I hope you enjoy your summer better than me.
