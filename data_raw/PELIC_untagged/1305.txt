A time when I was stolen money When I was 13years old I got some money as an allowance from my mother every months. One day I wanted a calendar of the pop star who I liked at that time. I brought a little money to get it to school. However when I left school I realized my purse had been stolen. Most students did not bring money to school because it was not allowed. Finally I found the purse on the way home. However all money in the purse had been stolen. It was impossible to find a suspect so that there were many students in school. This is the most tragic story I've ever had with money. Email ANON EMAIL
