Some people are probably more successful in their relationship because they have the qualities essential to loving relationships. The lack of these qualities is probably the cause of many problems. We have with other people many of us would benefit from developing those qualities which we don't have. For example many people get married and divorced over and over again. However others don't get along with coworkers on the job. Perhaps their lives would be easier if they were better at communication and they were more honest about their feelings.
