An impressed movie which features my favorite actress Yim Soo ANON_NAME_0 is Lump of Sugar . The movie is set in the island of Cheju where a heroine was born and raised. She was passionate lover of horses. She and horses shared a deep relationship. In the pastures of horses she especially took linking to the horse named Thunder who likes her lost someone very dear to mother at birth. Both character the heroine and Thunder matured and relied on each other for spiritual support that one's parents would give to their child. They shared a bond that was unbreakable. One day when Thunder was sold to another farm the two were separated tearfully with painstakingly recognizable sadness. Two years later the heroine who dreamed of becoming a singer comes across her forgotten friend Thunder once again. Their reunion plays a deep and profound meaning in the film. With instruction of her Thunder enters a horse racing derby. The story of the interrelationship between all things including animals and humans are presented as an influence in this theatrical production that will surely blow away the audience. A dream a woman and her horse who will ride to the end of the earth will bring warmth to the audience. The two in front of thousands of people will ride in their final race. Finally they won everybody was crazy about their fantastic racing. After the game Thunder's health was getting worse he died of weakness. This movie which impressed my mind deserves to watch it.
