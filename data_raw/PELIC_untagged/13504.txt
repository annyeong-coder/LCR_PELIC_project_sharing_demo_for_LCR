My favorite sports is Football. Because it is very exciting and interesting. It has several aspects. First football is very masculine sports. For example they tackle hardly and hit hardly. Next football is very intellectual sports. In general the quarterback is very clever. He must study many tactics. And then he must choose best one depending on the situation. I usually watch the game on TV. But I plan to go the Heinz Field on Norvember. I'm look forward to the day.
