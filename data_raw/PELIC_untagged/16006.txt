The most important elderly people in my life are my parents. My father is seventy three years old and my mother is sixty six years old. I remember when I was teenager that I had many problems with them because I did not understand why they did not let me do many things and why they wanted to have control over me. Also I did not understand the pieces of advice that they were giving me all the time. Some of these pieces of advice I remember like it were yesterday. My parents suggested that I have to choose carefully my friends and the people around me because many of them were not real friends. Also my parents insisted that I get a man mature and with good heart for husband. It was important for me to have someone who really loves and takes care of me in good and bad moments. In that time it was difficult because I did not understand why they were taking those actions. After a couple of years I realized that they are right. Many of the friends that I had in that moment are not with me anymore. Only my real friends are with me right now. Also the boyfriend I had when I was teenager disappeared because he was not interested in having a serious relationship he was interested in having fun with me for a little while. I am really grateful with God because he gave my parents who have given me all the support love and tools to be confident and successful in my life.
