I think that tourism has been changed by world events such as terrorist attacks and economic cycles. There are predictions in this article that I believe no longer hold true. For examples many tourists of U. S. Felt uncomfortable due to intricate entry formalities but these processes seem to not change because of terrorist attacks in U. S. Also many people avoid traveling abroad when the world marketplace shrinks away. People want to save their money and they may spend money when the world market has revived. However I think that China is exceptional country. China has been developing for decade and China has become an enormous marketplace. Many people have visited to China for their own purpose such as traveling studying and working.
