Eid Alfetter Calbration clabratin is the most enjoypul and happens gathereing that every one share into it. One of a big calbration we had as muslim is EID ALFETTER that we calbratit after fasting douring noon of rammadan days as relegone practice and thinking of a poor people who don't have any things to eat or any bisice needs . So at the end of the month we calprate by a big gift to the poor people and prays to thanks god for every thing we had and ask hem to excepte our practis and prays. In prosses to calbrat we bay a new cloth and sweet give a gifts to the poor people and pray greeting and meating with our relvant friends and nighboors in the mosqe or a houses or some restrant to calibreat .
