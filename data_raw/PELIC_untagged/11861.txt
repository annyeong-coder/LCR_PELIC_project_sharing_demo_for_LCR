My favorite place to eat lunch in Oakland My favorite place to eat lunch in Oakland is my house. Since my house is very close to the school I always go to my house to eat lunch. Actually there are several reasons because eating lunch in my house is more economic authentic and healthier. First of all my house is the most economic restaurant in Oakland. Every Saturday I go to Giant eagle and Korean grocery shop name of which is Seoul mart for whole week. Even if I spend the money less than 50 dollars I can prepare wonderful lunch for whole week. I can get wonderful food for less than 5 dollars. Second I can eat more authentic food in my house than in restaurants. I usually cook Korean food which is more authentic than any other restaurants in Oakland. Also I have many chances to have many different authentic foods because I have many roommates who are from different countries. For example Abin who from Nepal puts a lot of interesting spices and favors and specially his curry is so wonderful. Also I have roommates from Ghana Japan and other many countries so I can get many chances to have different kinds of country foods. It was so much fun which I never experience in restaurants. Last I can keep my health by eating health Korean food. Korean food is more balanced than American food which is usually served in restaurants following on nutritional studies. I do not use much meat or beef and I use much vegetables. And I do not use much sugar and salt which is very bad for my health. Even if I eat in a restaurant I should eat less healthy food than in my house. Many restaurant use a lot of sugar and salt to tempt many people. I sure that my house is the best restaurant in Oakland because I can save my money enjoy authentic foods and keep my heath.
