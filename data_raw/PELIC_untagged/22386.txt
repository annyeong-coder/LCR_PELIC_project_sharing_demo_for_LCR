My Idea of the ideal parent is the parent who loves his child without conditions. In other words the ideal parents who can give without waiting something back. The ideal parent who encourages his child to become himself as he wants not as the parent wishes The ideal parent who devotes himself to provide his child good life and good education the ideal parent who is always close when his child needs him The ideal parent who is able to accept his child unconditionally. Last but not least the ideal parent who is strong enough to support his child not to control him.
