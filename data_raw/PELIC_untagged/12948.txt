This chapter is about agitating people all over to help smokers to stop smoking. The editor is offering to everyone who is against tobacco commercials and ads against tobacco being promoted among people to write a letter to the president of the US about concerns and feelings about american cigarettes. I am not sure whether president of the US will at least read our letter but it is worth trying.
