I have a good surprising story which is the US VISA. Only in my country I who got his the US VISA during two days only. Actually when I received my VISA that was the greatest news because it takes usually between three to five weeks to receive it. Rarly have the US visa taken in short time like that I had. Only after the visa issued can I have fun and relax after stress that I have before I got it. In fact what this means is I was so lucky.
