Each person has many friends. The category of friends is different. Some of them do not be late when you need his helps and other friends create weak excuse to help me. In my opinion the indeed and really friend whose you find him in hard situation. The best friend offers things which I do not have them. For example my friend lands me his car that is very expensive one week. He wants me do not need to other person who is not honest with me. In conclusion I agree with the proverb which said that a friend in need is a friend indeed.
