center My House in Thailand indent My house in Thailand is a roman museum. When you walk pass though a gilded aluminum gate which is the main entrance of the house you will be on a long and wide shiny marble pathway with a flying angle statues. There are white and red rose gardens filled with thousands of vibrant roses on both sides of the road. Refreshed with scent of oriental flowers and summer breeze you are a bee flying over the meadow of roses. When you walk pass the fountain with a statue of Roman warrior nearby the rose garden in front of you lies the gigantic Roman style mansion. As you enter the door you will stand in the splendid main hall. You will feel like you are in a gallery because of the paintings and ancient armor around the wall. On your right there is a cozy living room with 2 windows with golden edged curtains and a gothic style fireplace. In this room you can sit on a large comfortable sofa while being surrounded with Roman historical books on the shelf and savoring hot tea in a silver teacup. In front of you is an opulent dining chamber. 12 Quilted armchairs around the oak dining table make me feel like I am Julius Cesar. On your right behind the wall is my bedroom. I have a big bed which makes you feel like you are lying on a pile of cotton. Because of all of these objects and decorations my relatives and friends always visit us and take a tour in my roman museum.
