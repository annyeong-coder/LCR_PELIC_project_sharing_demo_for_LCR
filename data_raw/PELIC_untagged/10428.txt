My room is really big but it is a little bit dark and messy. I decided to empty all the trash out my room. Also I am going to buy some lights to light up my room. Then I think I also need some coat hanger to hang out all my coats. After that maybe I can put up some posters which are some of the rock bands I really like. Finally I have to keep on cleaning my room I shouldn't always give up because of lazy.
