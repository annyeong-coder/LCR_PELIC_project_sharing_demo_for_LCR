I haven't deeply thought about my personality. As far as I read the article which categorizes personalities one category seems to fit me which is an introvert that belongs to Category 1. Other personalities in Category 2 3 and 4 fit me half and half which means that they sometimes fit me but sometimes don't. When I was a child I really liked being with people who were not only friends but also adults. When I was with people I was so excited and hilarious. Therefore I was an extrovert who is activated by being with others in my childhood. However now when I am with people whom I know or not I get nervous and tense. If I spend quite a long time with someone I get tired and want to go home to be alone. I like people and I like talking with people but I think something has changed in me. I'm not as same as when I was a child. I don't know why but I think I can't change again which means that I won't be able to be an extrovert. In addition I can do things more effectively when I'm alone. I think it shows one of the features of introverts whose energies are activated by being alone. In fact maybe I say few words when I am with many people.
