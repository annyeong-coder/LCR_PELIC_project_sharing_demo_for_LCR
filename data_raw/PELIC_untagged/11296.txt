My college classmate Eric who worked in a travel agent and whose company was one of the famous companies in Taiwan asked me for help because he needed a tour guide to lead his trip with him. Before the trip travel schedual details some of which we discussed were very trivial. They include rental hotels transportation problems and restaurants where we would eat everyday and that have a contract with his travel agent. I found that he is a person who prefers a predictable environment. He likes to make decisions and have things settled. He wants things to be definite. I can think of a time when he wasn't happy if the schedual could not be settled. Compared to him I am a perceiver. Keeping options open and flexible is the thing in which I'm interested because I prefer to experience as much of the world as possible. Helped him lead a tour an experience which made an impression on me.
