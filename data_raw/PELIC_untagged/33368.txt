No I would not like to live in Leisure ville. Because of Leisure ville is style of a rich people and I do not have the ability to live that life. When I see any slogans I started to pondering about the cost of living in Leisure ville. Just when I think about the price I have stings because alot of poor people are needing money to eat or drink. That is a heavy burden on my back when I think about famine.
