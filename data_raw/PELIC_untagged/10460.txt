Although I have learned and know many grammar rules I still make some grammar mistakes in what I shouldn't. The most outrageous of them is the subject verb agreement the use of the verb tenses. Two common mistakes I also do often are the use of articles and prepositions. I am working on my every recurrent mistake to avoid it in the future.
