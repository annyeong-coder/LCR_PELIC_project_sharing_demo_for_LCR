My friend Layla came to me asking for my advice. She was having a difficulty choosing which interior design company to decorate her new apartment. Since I had experienced this problem before I told her that she should choose companies that offer a warranty in case something goes wrong. For instance my neighbor Huda did not hire a company to do her decorations but instead she was selective. She distributed the work to other decoration offices where she faced many problems. Instead she should have chosen one only so that she would have the colors compatible to the ceiling and floor. Layla took my advice and now her apartment even looks better that mine. In future I might choose the same company as Layla because their work was very clean and beautiful.
