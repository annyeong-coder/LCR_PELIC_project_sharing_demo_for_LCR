A soul mate is somebody with whom one has a feeling of deep and natural affinity. I have a lot of friends who I always hang out with but nevertheless I'm still looking for someone whose characteristic is similar to mine and can be my soul mate. That person must be an easygoing one. Also my soul mate should be a college student. My soul mate is someone that I can trust. My friend who has a soul mate told me that a soul mate is someone who can grow with you. In my opinion the only way to grow together is to face challenges. He also said that a soul mate might not looks the way what you expect so you should keep an open mind. My soul mate has to be as old as me or a year or two younger maximum than me too. I think finding the right person which is the most important thing is difficult to me. The last requirement is my soul mate should be quiet and kind one. Finally that's person that I'm looking for.
