first of all when I sighed up for rent the house and then I saw the house I really lighted up because the house was a big and beautiful. However inner structure brought me down because that was not what I expected. Secondly I picked out the biggest room because I have many stuffs and I do not like small space. Finally in last winter the boiler of house started acting up because the house is too old. So I had to pay for in monthly gas fees about 140 even if I have 3 roommates. If someone ask me what I really want to change something if I can I strongly say that I will fix the boiler. Now I am counting on my roommates because they help me to adjust to live in Pittsburgh. Also I become to like this house.
