Nowadays even some political events include tobacco industry. For example a US senator while discussing trading practices with a Japanese prime minister told him to open ways wide for american cigarettes at least dor 20 within 18 months. Of course hoping for productive future partnership with the US the Japanese prime minister agreed to that. The results were shown very quick. The number of smoker increased for 16 percent. The same thing happened in South Korea or Thaiwan.
