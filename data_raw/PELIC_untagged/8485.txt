The percent of people who read the newspaper has changed a lot in the last 14 years. The graph indicates that many people had lost their reading habits and show us many important decrease about people who read newspaper from 1990 to 2004. In may 1990 70 percent of people had a newspaper. After two years on June 1992 there was a slowly increase and the percent peaked. Then the percents are decreasing slowly again . In four years there was a steady . About 71 percent people would read. But after 1998 there was a sudden decrease. According to graph 63 percent of people would give up to read a newspaper. Near the 2004 years the percent are very low. I think people who read a newspaper their percent are chancing associated with technology. Young people just aren't interested in reading a newspaper. They see they can read a news without pay and when they connect with computer they can select from literally thousand of information sources and moreover their hands never get dirty from newsprint. However in my opinion it doesn't matter which way you read. You just should notice that what is going on around your world. If you want to be sure or see your future you must read a newspaper .
