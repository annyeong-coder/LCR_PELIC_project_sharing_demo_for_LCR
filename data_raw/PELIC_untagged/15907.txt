First of all my team and I have to be one hand together we should share all these staffs equally. We don't have to use a piece of plastic as necessary as the rest of the stuffs. We had better use a bottle of water carefully because it is just what do we have. The blankets should be distributed among two teams so they may be use it or may be not. On the other hand a book of matches must not use unless there is no need for them because we need all of them during four days in the desert. However because we just have tow hours to gather everything else so we have to work fast because after tow hours we will not be able to do anything and we couldn't gather else our needs. Therefore we had better not lose our time.
