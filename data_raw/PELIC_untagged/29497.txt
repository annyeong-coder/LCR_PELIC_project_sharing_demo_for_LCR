Since I have moved to Pittsburgh I have done a lot of things. I was looking for a place to stay when I found a nice apartment in Washington Plaza. Then I started to furnish it. When I finished furnishing I had a placement test in ELI. I took the test and joined the ELI. I have been to few places in PIttsburgh such as Pittsburgh zoo and the south side. I went to the cinema and hangout with some friends.
