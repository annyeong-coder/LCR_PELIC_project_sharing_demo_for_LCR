My group and I after long argument decide to take with us 3 boxes of pasta one gallon of fresh water one ax one compass and maps of the area. The resent is pasts is carbohydrate with little sugar so the pasts can give to the body lot energy for long time. Water is part of the body without water we can survive. The ax is for making a boat with the boat we can survive. One compass can help as to navigate and a lot of maps for the same reason.
