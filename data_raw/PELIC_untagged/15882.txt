I was sleeping when my cell phone rang. Then I woke up as soon as I picked it up to answer. It was a person who was looking up a roommate in internet. He said I got your advertise while I was looking over craiglist. Is the room available now . I replied yes to him. He said how much is the rent . I replied to him that it s 300. He said would you mind if I come to see your apartment . I said I prefer to talk your self over before you make appointment with me to see the apartment. He said I am a 32 year old single man who needs a room in Pittsburgh PA . I said please hold on one moment I wanted to write down what he said. Then I said go on he said I would like to spend up to 300. I m easy to get along with I wake up at 6 00 a. M I enjoy swimming shopping and going to the movies. Then I hung up the phone I needed to think up an excuse to see his picture. Then I sent email to him Unfortunately my phone ran out of charg. I ask him could you please call me through skype . While I was talking to him I found out he was addicted there were many signs on his face which it clearly meant he was addicted. Then told him I will sign up your name. But there are many students on the waiting list I will go over it. If they are not interested in the room then I will call you back. After that he said' However I will want you to get back to me with the details about the room the total moving in cost and all the utilities as well as' I think he felt disappointed when I didn t give him appointment to see my apartment.
