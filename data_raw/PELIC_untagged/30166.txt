Despite the fact that there are proven destructive risks of using nuclear power I believe that its advantages far outweigh its risks. Nuclear power is more efficient and reliable and it does not depend on weather like wind power also it needs only a small amount of natural resources like Uranium. Nuclear power has less amount of waste produced so it is much healthier for human more than other types of power generation methods. It does not produced harmful gases emission. Although the initial cost of building nuclear plants is high the running costs are relatively low compared to other alternative power generation plants.
