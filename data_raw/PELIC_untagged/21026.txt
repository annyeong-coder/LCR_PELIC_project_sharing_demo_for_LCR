I have lived in Egypt for four years Egypt is a beautiful. It is a country with a lot of tourist areas. I'm real and I enjoy where I live and its people are good But one of the most crowded countries . The strangest that I saw him three pyramids. I think it's also one of the most polluted regions in the world. Compare with other America more beautiful than Egypt America more expensive than Egypt Egypt more pollution than America Egypt is the saddest than America Egypt most crowded than America
