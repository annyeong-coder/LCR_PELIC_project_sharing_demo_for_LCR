I thought I ought to have taken the university entrance exams again sometimes. Then I might have entered a better university rather than a small medical university. I could have known more friends who work in different areas however most of my friends work in the hospitals. I should have chosen a university which has a wide campus and equipment sufficient for students and then I might like my campus life more. In the other hand if I took the exams again and entered to the college next year I would be older than my classmates. Women always care so much about their ages. Maybe I should have studied hard in the high school or I ought not to have thought back any more that is unhelpful.
