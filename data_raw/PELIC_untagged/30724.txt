I was born and raised in Seoul which is the capital city of South Korea. Seoul having over ten million is a metropolitan city that has many historical and cultural landmarks. It continued as the capital of Korea during the Joseon Dynasty which was the previous kingdom of Korea from 14th century to 19th. In the center of Seoul historical king's palaces huge gates and stone walls are reserved which are very beautiful in harmony of the nature. My neighborhood is located in the south of the Han river total length of which is over 300 miles and remarkably wide which is more than a kilometer. The northern part of my neighborhood is university area having several universities and colleges. Many students live in this area where there are many facilities like gyms and public libraries. The southern part of my neighborhood is the center of finance of Korea. In the streets there are so many tall modern buildings occupied with full of businesspersons. The eastern part has several parks which have small hills and rivers. Also there are several artificial ponds and walking roads which the local government made along the trees. Many neighbors go there and take a walk and jogging in the parks where Children play cheerfully.
