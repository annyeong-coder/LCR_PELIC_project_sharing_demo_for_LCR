We are going to go to the east cost of the USA with our friends in the next summer. We prepared our plan about our vocation. Firstly we are going to fly to Los Angeles and then we are going to rent a car in the Los Angeles airport. We planned that we are going to stay in the Los Angeles nearly one week and then we are going to go to the California. After that we are going to go the San Francisco. I am happy to see the Disneyland. I think that my daughter will like there. We are trying to book our hotels but we cannot achieve it. We do not know that which hotel we will stay and how much money we will spend. I hope we can find good food especially for my daughter. On the other hand I am fear to sick my daughter because we didn t get long vocation with my daughter.
