Three weeks ago I went skiing with my friends at Seven Spring. When I arrived at Seven Spring the weather was very cold. I rented skis and my friend taught me how to ski. After that my friends took me to the lift and we went to the mountain. I skied at 9. 00 In the morning to 4. 00 In the afternoon. I thought skiing was so much fun.
