My apartment room is big enough for 2 people. However my room has some problems. For one thing dining room is very small. When I wash up dishes water is scattered around sync. Also water boils out while I'm cooking because of small pot. I'm not good at cutting so I might have cut out my finger before. Another thing is heater. Our heater uses gas. After turning on the heater it gives out smoked smell. Fortunately it's not cold in these days. So I usually turn off the heater before I go to school. Furthermore trash can for our apartment is very far from my room. It's very hard to take my trash bag out to the trash can. Also the floor in living room is very weak. It can fall in if I drop something little heavy. Moreover internet often doesn't work. The company haven't cut off the service. I think the problem is on wire in the wall. Window also very thin. It doesn't keep out of noise and cold wind. Even though my room has some problems I like my room.
