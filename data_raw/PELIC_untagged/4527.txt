In fact it's more comfortable for me to live alone in the home. But if I should have a room mate I want someone who doesn't have life simiral life style. Because I don't like clean my house every day and I can't cook any food. Even thouse I like having delicious food and I want to live in the neat house. So a person who can cook and has a car and who likes cleaning the house will be good room mate. Also a person who usually get up earlier than me to help me to wake up on time and always pick up me to my school when he goes to work will be perfect room mate!!
