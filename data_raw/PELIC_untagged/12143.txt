We have to follow American manner when we are in America. It is important to learn manner of another country especially when I visit to another country. First of all when you have a meal with American you should pay attention to sound when you are chewing because making no sounds is etiquette in America. Second there is basic manner to follow in public place. When you pass between people you should say 'excuse me' and as an answer people should say 'sorry' although they don't feel really sorry to me. Third you try to speak in English among friends. If you speak in your own language American friends will be uncomfortable. It is important to follow the American manner to keep good relationship with others people when you have a dinner you are in public place and you talk with your friends.
