My name is Candas but my classmates call me John . I like play soccer and I was proffessional soccer player in Turkey. Now I am taking English classes at the ELI in University Of Pittsburgh. After English classes I'm planing to go to the University in the U. S . Also I am thinking about my major . It could be Physical Education because I like sports and I believe that first of all we should know how to educate our bodies . Thats why I want to take Physical Education classes.
