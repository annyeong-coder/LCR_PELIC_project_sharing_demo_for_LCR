If I were the student of a technical high school instead of an academic high school I would have some great skills in technology filed. If I decided to go company after high school I would make much money for 12 years. If I did not enlist in Army for two years I would study more hard. If I studied more hard I would enter graduate school more easily. If I entered graduate school instead of compay I would have enough knowledge to research my interesting field. If I studied hard since fresh man I would get more excellent grade. If I were a woman I would get merried with someone when I was 20. If I continued working in last company I would be promoted to manager in R D center. If I was promoted to manager I would work harder than before. If I worked harder than before I would get a raise approximately double.
