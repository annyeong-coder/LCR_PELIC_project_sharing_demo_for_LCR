I recommend you five important things. Never do what Cathy did. She traveled alone without telling anyone. So the first thing you should do is to tell anyone about your plans. Because that person will be worry about you and if something happens he can help you. The second one is that you have to believe in yourself always think that impossible is nothing and that you have the strenght to overcome any obstacle. And remember Sir Ernest a man who was reliable a man who always believe in in himself and with that he achieved to keep his men alive. Also I recommend you to carry on some emergency number like the north shore rescue. Also carry on some provisions and a good equipment that supplies your needs. And finally never forget that you are not alone in this world and that someone needs you. Just remember Aron who thinks in his vision where he saw his son an that gave him the strenght to cut his arm below the elbow.
