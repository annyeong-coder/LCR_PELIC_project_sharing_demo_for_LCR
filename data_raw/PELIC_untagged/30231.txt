I think dark tourism is the most strangest because dark tourism travel to the scene of both natural and man made disasters. When some places had disasters that means many people could die. For expamle the place was destroyed by flooding during Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. The catastrophe happened and we should feel sadness. However the tourism pay money to be engulfed in scenes of death. It makes me feel so strange.
