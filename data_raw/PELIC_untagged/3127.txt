It is very difficult find a woman that does not like jewelries. I am a woman and I love jewelries because jewelry is forever. If I received a gift of money and I can chose how spend it I will buy a piece of jewelry for myself. It has an economic and emotional valor. I particularly like diamond the good ones because is so sparkle and clear. If is possible buy something special for myself I will buy a jewelry. Jewelry is something special and will be with me forever. A ticket for a event is also something good but is just it. May be after I see it will be just in mine memory least what I remember of it.
