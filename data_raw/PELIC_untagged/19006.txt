If money were no object I want to o to tibet . I think it is a really ood place for people who love adventures. First tibet is a place with many beautiful places and these places are not polluted and explored. So I think these places must be very different from others in china. It is different fellin to see these places. Second reliion is deep rooted in tibet. Everyone in tibte is et involved in reliion and insist on their faiths. This is also interestin me very much. Third there are many special food and drink in tibet. I like to try every different food from different places. I think food and drink can reflect cultures. So it is easy to know culture by eatin their traditional food. I also want to see peoples real life in tibet because it is very different from other provinces in china. So it must be a amazin trip to tibet. So tibet attracts me so much.
