Weekends are the time that most of the people can take a small rest from their work or study. Friday and Sunday are taking place on the weekends and there are some similarities and differences between them I will illustrate them in this essay. I will focus on some aspects which are related to the communication activities food sleep time feelings and religious. For communications among others both day people are meeting their friends and family. For me I spent most of the time with my friends on Fridays and on Sunday I usually gathered with my family and relatives at home. There are many activities I always do on Friday but not on Sunday. On Friday I have the opportunity to go shopping and watch a movie while on Sunday I do some chores do the homework and study for Monday. Other area of difference between Friday and Sunday is sleeping time. On Fridays I cannot stay wake at night because I had school in that day morning. On the other hand I usually go to bed very late on Sundays because I woke up late and take enough sleep. Feelings are totally different in these two days. I feel happy and excited on Fridays because I know that I did not have something to worry about it and I will sleep as much as I need however I feel miserable and so lazy because the heavy Monday that will come. In the religious aspect Friday in Islam corresponds to the Sunday in Christianity as a holy day which make these days have such a similar thing. I really have some fun and exciting on weekends. But for my perspective I see that Fridays and Sundays are totally difference. I think it depend on what should I need to do and what could I can get through.
