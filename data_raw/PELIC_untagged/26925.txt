I saw the movie which is based on the book which named Up In The Air directed by Jason Reitman starring George Clooney. George Clooney who won a Best Actor Oscar featuring a leading role in this movie named Ryan. Ryan whose job as a career transition counselor that means he fires people. Ryan is flying around the US over 320 days of the year which he feels is the best part of his job. Ryan's frequent flyer miles all of which is close to his ultimate goal One million frequent flyer miles but he suddenly find out that he want to accept a relationship starting think about a home.
