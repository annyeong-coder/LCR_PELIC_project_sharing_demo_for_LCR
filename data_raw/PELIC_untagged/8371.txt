Pressure in being a high school student in Korea is inevitable problem. According to the research of the ministry of education more than 200 high school students died of suicide by pressure in 2006. Pressure causes a suicide. There are several reasons of pressure such as tuition grade friend study girl friend and so on. However among them on account of friend grade and making a decision many students get a pressures in be a high school student. First making a friend is one of the pressures during their school life. Some passive students do not make a friend and cannot get along with friend either. So they are usually keeping to themselves. Even they are insulted by their friends. Second reason grade is very important for student. Parents want their child to get a good grade. Since they have a lot of tests and a lot of quizzes they don't have enough time to enjoy their free time. As usual ordinary people regard good grade to good student regardless of personality special ability and attitude. It will become a stress for student. Last it is too young to make a decision for their future. Before graduate from high school they have to decide what they are going to do. But when they decide they are just 18years old. Actually they don't know what is cut out for them which choice is better and what they are talent for. They cannot make a decision on logic. Therefore they must worry too much about their choice In conclusion being a high school student in Korea suffer from pressure such as grade friend making a decision. Who is responsible for and who can help them It is not only students own problems but also education system problems. In my opinion the way to reduce a stress from three reasons needs some rigid politics such consultant system also students have to endeavor to their aptitude for making a decision for their future.
