Last month at weekend I had trying to do meal for my family. It was funny night that was a beautiful meal. I did the kabsa by my self. At first I putted a cup of water with onions tomatous and a piece of meat. After half hour I put rice and salt to them with one piece of magi. Finally kabsa was ready after an hour and me with my family was interesting together.
