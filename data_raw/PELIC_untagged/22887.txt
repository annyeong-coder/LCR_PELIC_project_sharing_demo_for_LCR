The movie which a saw recently is called up in the air. I saw the movie at Manor Theater which is located in Squirrel hill. It's a comedy drama which portrays the impact of financial crisis on the employees. The film was directed by Jason Reitman who is a Canadian director producer screen writer and actor. He directed many movies all of which I like. Also he nominated for Academy Award two of which are for the best director. The idea of the move was taken from up in the air novel which was written by Walter Kim. The main character in the movie is George Clooney who is in charge of leading the restructuring process. Clooney's sister whose husband is not able to afford their wedding cost asked him to take her picture with her husband at every place Clooney goes. Clooney's main assistant was Anna Kendrick who was in charge of announcing fairing decisions to the employees.
