There are many things that I spend my free time doing them. First I like to play soccer. I have been playing it since I was in grade 7. I have been playing soccer with my Thai friends for once a week when I am here Pittsburgh . Second I like to surf internet. I have surfed internet for 8 years. I like to read news or check email or chat with my friends on internet. I spend over 3 hours to surf internet everyday. I think I should decrease that time because I need more time for studying English. The last I also like to go outside with my friends. We usually go to have dinner or walking around at mall but I have never gone with my friends since I am here. Because my friends are very busy.
