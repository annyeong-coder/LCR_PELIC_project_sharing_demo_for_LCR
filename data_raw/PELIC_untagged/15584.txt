I think that the greatest act of sportsmanship came from the Milwaukee Madison when they didn't want to take the technical foul and ending up missing it on purpose. Johntel who came to join his team even though his mother died earlier showed a great honor by butting his grief a side and helping his team and finally the team and the school of DeKalb where there for Johntel and his mother at the hospital and at the funeral.
