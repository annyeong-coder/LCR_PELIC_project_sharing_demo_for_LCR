Class 3F Date Jan 29 07 My Writing Habits How I study is very important to how I learn English. I've never studied in my bedroom because I learned that the place where I study influences my concentration. I prefer a quiet place. A quiet environment influences my concentration too. I like to sleep in late so I prefer to study in the evening. Sometimes if I can't think about what to write I take time to rest until I am ready to write again. For example I smoke and watch TV. When I finish my homework I want to drink a beer. When I do all of these things I believe my studying is more effective.
