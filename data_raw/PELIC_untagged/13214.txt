In my opinion English seen as Co Star among Global Language is more persuasive than Can English be dethroned . First of all second article show me a bar graph which explains percent of total population speaking native language. It gave me specific information so I can understand easily. Besides the organization of second article is clearer than. The first article's organization is very complex so I could not understand accurately. I think when writers want to persuade to some people they should write easily for audiences. Finally second article attached a quotation of a professional so I think it is authentic. For these reason I think second article can persuade to people.
