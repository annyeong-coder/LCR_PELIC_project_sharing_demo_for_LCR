By the time I came here I had been in charge of a delegate for advertising festival. As a chief I had to prepare regarding all factors of festival. I had been meeting clients who wanted to execute advertising campaign or public relation campaign because we had been able to maintain the festival by obtaining money from clients. It was evidently hard time for me that I had to manage for the advertising festival. I had been considering giving up the festival while I prepared it. By the way I was able to ahieve my goal that held the festival very well owing to my friends who had been follwing to help me.
