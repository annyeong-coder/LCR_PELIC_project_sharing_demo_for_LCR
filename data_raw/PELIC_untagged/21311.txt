I think a group like PETA should exist for animals and keep watching researchers. Unfortunately many animals die for researches even though some of them do not need animal testing. If there is no group like PETA the animal testing will be indiscriminate. Therefore groups like PETA should make the criteria of the animal testing keep watching researchers and represent animals. I strongly believe there is a need for group like PETA.
