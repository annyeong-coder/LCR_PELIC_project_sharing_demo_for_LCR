Today is Sunday. I'm going to cook pancakes for breakfast. Ingredients are eggs flour milk sugar salt and butter. First crack the eggs into a bowl and beat them well. Second add the flour into the bowl. Next add the milk little by little and mix them carefully. Don't over mix. Then add the sugar and the salt. After that heat a frying pan in moderate fire and put the butter in the pan. When the butter melts put the dough in it. Then griddle both sides till being golden brown. Finally remove it to dish and enjoy it with maple syrup. It will be delicious. I promise. How about you too
