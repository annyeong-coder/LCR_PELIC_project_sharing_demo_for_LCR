A good man finds all the world friendly. Hindustan proverb If you know my best friend in Brazil whom I miss very much you will have that proverb proved. She is the friendliest person who I have ever met. I have never seen her making bad judgments about someone else. First I met her because I was looking for an English teacher who could give me tutoring classes. I used to go to her house which was very cozy where we used to study English for one single hour and we used to talk about several subjects for many hours. By that time she had become my family in Sao Paulo. The best time that I had spent through my life was with her company. Her positivism also helped me to win a personal battle against depression disease from which I had suffered for many years. She is very communicative and talkative. She helped me to improve my English and that is very useful for my career. She has one dog that is the same breed than mine. We used to walk for several hours with the dogs which also became good friends. We used to cook together some Brazilian recipes which were very delicious. I am looking forward to meeting her when I will get back to Brazil.
