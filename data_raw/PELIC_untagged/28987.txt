If I would be in a desert island I definitely may need a knife because I might cut tree leaves and wood to cover the place I would sleep and also because I should fish to eat and it will be useful. Other thing I ought to bring could be matches to make fire and maybe to frighten away the bugs and cooking too A flash lighter as well to see at night. Someone could feel scared who knows what may happen in middle of the sea at midnight. My extra object might be fresh water. In the island we should drink it because the salty water might us thirstier. I would never bring chocolate because it melts so fast instead of that I will bring a tooth brush.
