In my case it would be easy to have this condition. Even though the dog has emotion the human is kind of animal. By sense to tell we mind which our feeling is. If we could without emotion then we would be similar to robot. As long as you have life you will exactly have emotion. And our emotion curve is going down and up. When we are sad normal people have the stop of the point. On the other side is the same. So we can learn to control our emotion and let us feel balance. Emotional intelligence is kind of part important manage in my life.
