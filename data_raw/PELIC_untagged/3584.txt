People have a lot of opinions about rain. I don't like rain because my clothes get wet. One of my classmates I Ling also doesn't like rain for same reason. However Hussein who is my classmate says The rain makes the sky so beautiful. I was surprised at his opinion because most people usually have a bad feeling about rain. I found other student who has a good feeling about rain. It's a really good time when I'm sitting in a chair and watching the people outside or hearing the sound of rain said Eui Hyun. When it is raining I always have a bad feeling and never have a good feeling. Maybe the reason why I don't like rain is that I cannot enjoy going outside. I need rain however I don't like rain for personal reason. So I want to be optimistic person who can change bad things to good things.
