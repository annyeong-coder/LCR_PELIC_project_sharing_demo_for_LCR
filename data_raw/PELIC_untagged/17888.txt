Dear Confused I've got a suggestion for you. Importantly think over it if your boyfriend is a man who is appropriate for the rest of your life and you really love him. If you think so convince your family to accept how much you love him and how proper he is as a spouse. If I were one of you parents I wouldn't mind. Just make sure to give them rational explanation. Hopefully you have a right choice in the future.
