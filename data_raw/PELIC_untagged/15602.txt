DeKalb Although it is not a very strong team it has kind friendly and understanding players. Because it has developed a friendly rivalry with Milwaukee Madison. Espacially the coach Dave Rohlman and the captain Darius McNeal. They intencially missed the two free throws because they thought Johntel Franklin should be in the team if his mother did not die. Milwaukee Madison It is a united team. When the mother of Franklin died some of the teammates were at the hospital too. The coach Aaron Womack once wanted to cancle the game considering the sad feeling of the players. He cares his players. At end Franklin helped the team win the game. Referees I think they did the right thing to give DeKalb two free throws. It is the role in this kind of sport. And the reason why sports can be called sports not just playing is that it has roles.
