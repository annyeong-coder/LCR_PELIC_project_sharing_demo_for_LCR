I think it is strange to throw away something still in usable condition. For there are many people who need it. Especially in Pittsburgh we can not easily predict when it rains so it something you throw away could be wet and become really not useful thing anymore. Therefore I think if you don't want something anymore you'd rather give someone need it or charities.
