Building prisons inside a city is a big issue. Especially if it's in my neighborhood. People always argue whether prisons should be built in or out the city. I believe that prisons should be built outside the cities far away from neighborhoods for many reasons. If there is a prison in my neighborhood it would affect my daily life in different aspects. It would increase the traffic problem because there will be a lot of people working there people who come to visit. Therefore my neighborhood won't be as calm and peaceful as it used to be. Some people might say that they would prefer to prisons to be built inside neighborhoods because it would be easier for the employees to work in the city close to their families . I understand there point but I also have the wright to live In a peace quiet neighborhood. Finally governments spouse to conduct studies about this issue whether to build the prisons inside the cities within the neighborhoods or outside. I believe that if they do so they will find a lot of good reasons to not build prisons in neighborhoods.
