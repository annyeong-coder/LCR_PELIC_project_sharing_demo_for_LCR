As a writer having background knowledge is very important. In fact many of people write before understand the topic. But for the successful writing the writer must know about the topic. So whenever I got the assignment for write something I collect information about the topic. If I don't have much time for that I read the journal or report that write with same topic. In the writhing I 'm good at explain something easy. Again I can use the word that easy to understand to the readers. But these skills are possible based on understanding of topic. In addition I can write a sentence that has clear meaning. On the other hand I am very terrible at organizing. I can write each sentence well but whenever I trying to connect them It's all messed up. Also I always concerned about my grammar. It's very difficult to find the right position of the word.
