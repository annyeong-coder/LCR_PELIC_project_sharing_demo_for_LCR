There are two important points which are contained in a good paragraph. One point is that the main idea should be clarified in the paragraph. The main idea is what the writer wants to say so it's important to judge how the writing is and what its about. If it's ambiguous it will be confusing for readers to understand what each paragraph wants to talk about. The other point is that it should be well organized. An organized paragraph is that a topic sentence and supporting sentences are in a right position to make readers read easily and understand well. Even if it's a good topic and has good contents in the paragraph it's hard to say that the paragraph is a good one if the flow of writing is messy as the very last sentence mentioned. If those two points the clear main idea and good organization are sufficient in the paragraph it can be said that it's a good paragraph.
