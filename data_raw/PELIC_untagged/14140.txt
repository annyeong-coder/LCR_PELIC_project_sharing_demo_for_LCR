The funniest truth is that nothing is funny in my life. I was overwhelmed by the fact that school works are filled with boring homework assignments and uninspiring reading articles. What makes me feel so bored is that my life is so boring and meaningless. Living cost in US is so high that I cannot buy things I like. Why I do not feel like going out is the weather is so cold. I am sure that my apartment is a dump I feel filthy staying home. Besides I feel sad tat have no close friends here to talk with. I think that My English is so bad that prevents me from making new friends. I am afraid that I cannot write a funny thing today. What I hope is to wit a really funny thing during my stay in the United State. I want to learn more about whatever is interesting and funny. However the above sentences presented here are just nonsense uttering that I made for this homework. Please don't take them seriously.
