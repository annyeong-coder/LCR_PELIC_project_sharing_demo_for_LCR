I choose the topic of English Is Not An Instrument of Cultural Imperialism . Though there is much resistance to study English more and more people in the world are studying English now. Some people maybe think studying English is an instrument of cultural imperialism but in my opinion English only a language. It is an instrument for many things such as communication learning and business but not for cultural imperialism. We need a method to communicate with nonnative speakers. In other words there must be a kind of language be used in the worldwide communication. If it is not English it must be another language. Obviously cultural imperialism is a big problem all over the world. However we should not attribute this phenomenon to the English studying. I am wondering that why some people think studying English will kill their culture customs. Studying English just like learning how to control one tool. This does not change your thought. On the contrary it is a good way to help you understand how the English Speakers think. All in all do not be controlled by your tool. Just let the tool makes some benefits for you!
