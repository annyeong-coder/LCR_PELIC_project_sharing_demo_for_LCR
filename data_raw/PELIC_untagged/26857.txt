One of the most fascinating movies I have seen is Inception starring Leonardo DiCaprio. The movie's trailer doing a good job by not giving out too much information did not appeal to my taste at first. The movie and the way it was presented made it seem like another Hollywood movie that was more about the cast and budget rather than the quality of the movie. Yet I was pleasantly surprised by the film. The film is about people with the ability to retrieve information from one's dream or plant an idea in the subconscious. In the movie the main character Leonardo DiCaprio tries to overcome his grief from losing his wife while attempting a dangerous task of planting an idea in a person's subconscious. The film also explores the idea of dream versus reality and how people can lose track of dream or reality. The reason I like this film was the engaging debate with friends after watching the film. The film was filmed in a way where possibilities existed not limited only to the ending of the film itself but the audience's imagination.
