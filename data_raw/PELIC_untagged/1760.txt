I think ANON_NAME_0's is a great fast food restaurant because it has some characteristics such as cheap cost cleanliness and good service. Actually these criteria are the reasons why I like ANON_NAME_0's. Regarding the cost for ANON_NAME_0's meals it is cheaper than some fast food restaurants. For example combo spicy chicken meal is between 6 7. Also sometimes they have special offers for their meals which can lower the cost. One day I was surprised when I saw one of special offers in ANON_NAME_0's one sandwich for 1 only. Perhaps ANON_NAME_0's is the cleanest fast food in the U. S.

You can get your order from inside the restaurant or outside in your car. Also you don't need a long time to obtain your order they are very quick to serve their meals. Next they are opened even late at night. If you feel hungry at night you should think of ANON_NAME_0's. However sometimes I meet workers that serve your order but they look forced. Sometimes you don't see any smiles from them. I like it because has a cheap price clean good service. Because of these things I feel comfortable when I eat at ANON_NAME_0's.
