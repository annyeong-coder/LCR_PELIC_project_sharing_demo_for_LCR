An important environmental issue is to save endangered animals. Endangered animals are those species that are in danger of going extinct. The reasons are varied but the most common reason is because of people's decision to live or build industries in their habitats. It's important to protect those animals because are species that could be lost forever. Some animals that are in danger of extinction are tortoises African elephants gorillas koalas pelicans gooses and some whales. We should protect them and avoid living or building industries in their habitats. We can replace the place of our houses or industries but they can't replace their natural habitats.
