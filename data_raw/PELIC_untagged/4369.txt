Last year I had an acident. I was not who caused the accident. The other person who was driving the other car had turned without paying attintion. I told the officer that he caused the accident I said he souldn't have turned without paying attiontin to other drivers. The officer didn't believe me and he blamed me. He was able to see the accident location but he didn't. After that I paid for that person's car. I think I must have gome to the presidnt of the police department to tell him about the story. However It is to late I sould have thought about this at that time.
