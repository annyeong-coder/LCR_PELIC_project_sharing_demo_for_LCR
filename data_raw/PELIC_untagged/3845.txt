The ELI programs are very intensive course. If you want to improve your English skills you should take full time course. Also they offer many opportunities to students. If you want to have more time to speak with native speakers you can join talking time class. In addition whenever you want to go somewhere near Pittsburgh you could ask to activity advisor ANON_NAME_0. However the ELI has strong rule about attendance. If you absent more than 15 times you can't get the certification from the ELI. But if you have reasonable excuse they would not count that as an absent.
