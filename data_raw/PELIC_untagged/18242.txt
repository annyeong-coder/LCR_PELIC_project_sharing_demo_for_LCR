Hello my name is Yi chun Last Name . I applied and sent all of the requested application form to the music department of graduate school one month ago. I applied for major piano performance in the music school. But till now I didn't receive any information from the office of admissions. I'm worry about that if you didn't get all of my requested materials or any requested information that I lost. Can you please resend me email if I lost something important or should I be more patient to waiting the result. Thank you for helping me. Sincerely Joy
