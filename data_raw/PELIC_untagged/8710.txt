I had a very important meeting to plan my Ph. D. Thesis and I was running late. My inner voice was telling me to drive across my neighborhood which had very narrow streets and lots of stop signs. I decided that to play it safe I would take my usual route using the nearby highway. Unfortunately there was a major accident and I did not see the traffic jam until I was through the entry ramp. There was no way back and no turn around for a few miles. If I had listened to my inner voice I would have entered the highway beyond the accident. If I had paid more attention to the time I would have gone through the highway before the accident. I wished to be earlier and I wished I would have taken another route but to no avail I arrived late very late for my meeting.
