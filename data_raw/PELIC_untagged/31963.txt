They had many activities to do there were some playing volleyball others had some activities with their children most of them tried to make a tan. We walked among these people and participated them by talking and laughing. We chose our place and got out our stuff chairs table food drinks umbrella and swimming suit. I brought sun block cream and hat. ANON_NAME_0 liked to discover sea secrets. He picked up several shells to listen to them it looked like music. Also he wore swimming glasses to discover our area.
