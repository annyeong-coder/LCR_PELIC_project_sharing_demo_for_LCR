It is crucial that creativity be encouraged and enforced in schools. Creativity requires practice. Just like any other academic subject creativity needs to be practiced. School programs and teachers must encourage students and push students to be more creative. It is not possible for children to be creative outside of school alone. Children spend most of their time in school therefore school is the most logical and effective place for children to be creative.
