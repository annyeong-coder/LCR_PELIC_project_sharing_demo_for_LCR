An airplane and a train have several things in common. First of all an airplane is transportation and a train is too. Both an airplane and a train can carry lots of passengers and freights. Both of them are operated by timetable. Operation of both is dependent upon the weather. For example when it is heavy snow an airplane doesn't fly because the wings of it have lots of snow. A train also doesn't run because the train roads are covered by avalanches. I like traveling both of them. Both an airplane and a train are useful transportation. An airplane and a train have many differences. First of all an airplane is sky Transportation but a train is ground transportation. Although an airplane usually flies Overseas a train runs on the ground. In addition the cost of airplane is more expensive than the cost of train. Unlike a train we can have a meal with free of charge on the airplane and definitely divide into sections of class. During the vacation seasons an airplane is more popular than a train when people want to travel overseas. Unlike a train an airplane can fly from Pittsburgh to Seoul in 18 hours.
