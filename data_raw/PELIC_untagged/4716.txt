I met my friend Sangyoung who traveled in Europe with me when I was a freshman at university. While we were traveling we could share exciting experiances. The first time we met was not special. My university was a women's university. Therefore there were no men. So we had to make opportunities to meet men. Sometimes we had a blind date with groups. We called such a date Meeting . While my frieds and I were sitting at the bar Sangyoung came in. After she came in the bar some guys arrived. We had a great time playing board games. After meeting girls sometimes got more familiar with each other Sangyoung and I bacame a good friends.
