At first a good paragraph should be easy to read. If someone who doesn't know about the subject writes a paragraph it becomes difficult to understand because he she writes with difficult words and expressions. If writer knows about the subject well he she can explain easily. Writer should study and think deliberately about the subject. Secondly a good paragraph is simple. If a writer has strong will to persuade all readers he she could add unnecessary parts that are not needed for the paragraph. A writer should make a paragraph concisely. Thirdly a good paragraph should be well founded. In order to persuade readers the writer should show appropriate basis and examples. Good basis and examples make a paragraph more reliable.
