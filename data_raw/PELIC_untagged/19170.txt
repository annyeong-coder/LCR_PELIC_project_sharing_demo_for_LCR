I remember one of my friends was driving at speed. One day while traveling to his family was driving too fast can not controlled in the car making the car hitting the strong but his injuries did not happen. After this incident. I was in my work when I heard the news from a friend and I went to him and advised him to learn from what happened to him is that he sweared will not lead so quickly again but after a while returned to the speed and the result. He was injured in accident making it into a broken back and is now could not walk I wish him to recover.
