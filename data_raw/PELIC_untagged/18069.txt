I think that students should wear the cloths which is compatibale with all the situation. For example and in case of Begum she could have wearn a modest cloths like long non reaveling skirt and at that time nobody will have any peoblem. In isalam as I know and as I beleive the cloths should be non reaveling cloths. Some people might say that the jilbab is the most modest clothing for a muslm women but in the same time the wide skirt will do the same in my opinion. The question here that you might ask is can a non muslim student wear what ever he or she wants in a muslim school . Of course not. So why are we asking other people to do things to us while in the same time we can not do the same thing for the others. I am not saying here that Begum does not have the right to wear what she want to wear of course she does has the right to do that but if that issue is so important for Begum and here family why did not they go back and live in islamic country which is the right ground for any muslim to be on. On one hand the banning of the headscarf for musilm women in france is extrem violation to the human rights becasue the head cover is not in any way a sign for extermity. Further more alot of non muslim women wear the headscarf as a part of their outfite. On the other hand I am realy confused about the banning of the borqa. France is a secular counrty with a christian values and when france discussign banning the porqa all the people start to say the is a war aginst islam while tunisa is also a secular country but with islamic values or background and the porqa is already banned over their NOBODY is saying anything about that. Bottom line people need to know what they exactly want and do it in the right way not just circuling a round the truth.
