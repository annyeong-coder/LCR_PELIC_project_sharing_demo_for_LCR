Before I came here I had never eaten pizza that often. In my hometown we uauslly eat pizza on special days like big holidays freinds' birthday or special events. But after I came here everyone seems to eat pizza almost every week or month! Sometime when you go out you might order pizza for lunch or dinner when you go to a mall to buy food you might buy pizza if you don't want to cook when you have friends or party at home you probably will prepare pizza. There's so many chances to eat pizza here than in my homeown. Now I'm scared of eating pizza. Once or twice a month I can haddle it. But once a week I can't.
