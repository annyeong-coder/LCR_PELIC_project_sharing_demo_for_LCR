I believe that wearing religious clothing is one of the fundamental human rights. The constitutions of many countries guarantee religious freedom and freedom of expression. This means that majority of contemporary humankind share these kinds of rights as the fundamental human rights. Not a single person allow to violate fundamental human rights of the other. Based on the fundamental human rights I would suggest the French government allow freedom of expressions as long as she wears for her free will. Wearing religious clothing should be allowed anywhere anytime and for anyone
