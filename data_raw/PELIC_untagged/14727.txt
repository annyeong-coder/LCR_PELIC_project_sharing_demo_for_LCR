When I went to dance school several years ago teacher of that dance school helped me improve my dancing skill. At first she got me to move as widely as possible because I moved to dance too small. Also she said to me that being afraid of making mistakes never made me progress. Finally her teaching had me feel good and got me to improve my dancing.
