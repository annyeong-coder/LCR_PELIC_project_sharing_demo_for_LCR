There are many ties between things that mentioned in the question. First the ties between individual freedom and political power very strong because if the government for example commands its people to do something on English language the freedom is destroyed here that must people use English language. Second when the people want to communicate together by non native language some of them will face some problems with dealing with people because they don't familiar on the other language. That's my notice regarding ties between linguistic and economic and social. Third when the people use second or other language usually that make theme forget some tradition habits or something relates with their culture. For example I am as a Muslim and my country is Muslim we are doing a lot of worshiping for Allah that must perform in Arabic language. So if anyone doesn't know this language how will perform it According to the author English language make other language destroyed.
