There are four windows in my apartment. Although I had to pick up four blind curtains because of these it can let the sunlight in. So I don't have to turn the light on in the morning and the afternoon. At the first few days when I moved here I spent all day putting away my stuffs and moving around some furniture. And I hung up some pictures of my family on the wall. It cheers me up when I miss my family. When I come back from the school it is a wonderful place that I can relax. I'd like to fix the kitchen up because it will bring some change to my apartment. However since my kitchen is so small I have to satisfy with just cleaning up.
