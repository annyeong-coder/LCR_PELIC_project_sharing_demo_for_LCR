Center Eid Alfater holiday indent Eid Alfater is a special holiday to camp which is a part of its activities. Many people in my country go to the desert to have fun there. After belaying the baggage with equipment of the camps behind the car you're being ready to go because starting in the morning give you a scene of activity. After arriving in an area that you want to camp and pulling up the first part to start with is making the tent. However men usually help each other to arrange everything and putting them in the order specially the heavy equipment such as the water tang. In the other hand women help in making dishes and sometimes go hiking for children they play in the sands just like angels that plays with clouds. Going out to the deserts in these days has a deep feelings of recovery that make you act like there is no one is surrounding you only the sands and the wind. After one week of being there people takes there stuff out and come back again to their houses with a tired faces. Getting inside your house after the desert gives you an exciting feeling that make you wish to go back again.
