Dear Mr. ANON_NAME_0 I am a student at the EFL Computer Training Institute. My classes are very good but the classroom is very missy and it doesn't have enough computers so my classmates and I use one computer. First maybe you should come and see my class. Second I think you ought to buy new and enough computers because they are bad. Third I believe you'd better need some people clean classroom for example. We need to change color class because it is very old and bad. Also I think you should tell the students don't eat and drink in class. I think you'd better need to change window because it is breakable. Maybe you should need custodian because class is very missy. I think you should buy some lamps because some lamps don't work.
