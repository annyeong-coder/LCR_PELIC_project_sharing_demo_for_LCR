I learned how to ride a bicycle when I was 7 years old. I had ridden a tricycle bike with three wheels before but I had never ridden bicycle. My father taught me every weekend. He told me Don't be scared and face front. Before I tried to ride I'd been scaring of falling down. When I fell down several times he cheered me up. I'd been making lots of mistakes before I could ride a bicycle well.
