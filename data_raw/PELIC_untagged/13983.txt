I sometimes have flow when I'm reading a very interesting book. When I'm reading the book I forget about myself such as where I am now and what I'm doing now because I'm deeply involved in reading it. Every time I'm in the state of flow I'm away from reality and feel as if I were living in the world of the book. I don't know if my sense of flow has ever contributed to a feeling of creativity. However in flow I read the book at astonishing speed. Also when I'm reading the book that makes me in flow I'm not conscious of time because I can't think anything but the book. In fact I have missed a train or getting off at a bus stop several times. From those experiences I came to think that the total absorption in the state of flow prevents me from keeping to my schedule so recently I have tried not to be absorbed in doing one thing for a long time but to distribute the time to several things.
