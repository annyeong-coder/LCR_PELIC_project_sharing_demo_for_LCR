EVALUATE OF ALANYA ESSAY Even if my essay was short I think it s organization was well but grammar was not well. I should accept that latter is worst than former. My essay was about Alanya that is the best holiday place in my country. In my essay I gave diverse information in which anyone needs to them when he go to Alanya for holiday. These information were generally climate transportation cloth finance and something that anyone care to. I started my essay with general climate information. If anyone thinks to go to the holiday before everything he should care that how is the weather there. I think it is most important part of the holiday decision. After the decision that where he will go the second point is how can he go to there by cheaper and comfortable. He need to information about transportation possibilities. He should compare the different options. Many of people choose the plane but this person who will go to the holiday maybe like to traveling by car. Therefore I gave some information about highways and environments. I pointed out advantages and disadvantages different traveling options. I allow the decide him. The other thing in which the people consider very deeply is accommodation options. I wrote some recommendation and advice about accommodation options. The time wasnt enough. I am sorry.
