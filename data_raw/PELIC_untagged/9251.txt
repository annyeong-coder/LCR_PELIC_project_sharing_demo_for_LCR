My father looks smart. First he wears glasses. Second he is medium height and weight. Also he has a short black hair just like me. Next he always wears polo shirts. Then he looks very warm. In addition he has few white hair. Finally he is always smiling. Everybody say that my father looks match his job of professor. My father not only looks smart he is also very kind. First he always volunteers to help high school students to choose their major because it always confuses us in Taiwan. Second he also volunteers to help others who need help for example someone who is very old and lives without a family. Then he helps me to study math everyday. Next he is really nice to everyone. Finally he always helps my mother to do housework. My father is a good person I really like him.
