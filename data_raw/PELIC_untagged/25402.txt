ANON_NAME_0 Last Name 5s 6 4 10. In my perspective being an only child in your family or the last child will affect your personality and you maybe become the spoiled child in the family. Many families are treating their children especially when the baby is the only child in the family or the last one. For example my family members are ten people. The first person carries the heavy load and he responsible for everything after the father. However the last child in my family is spoiled and my father tries to provide anything he wants. I think this thing is inherent in every parents.
