I got know my Egyptian friend Huda in pyramids while I was making tourism in Egypt. In the pyramids while we were discovering the place with my family I went to a small mosque there. She was praying beside me when I met her. When we finished we started with short conversation about where I'm from and so in. We exchanged phone numbers when we split out. After a few days Huda called me and invited me to have a dinner at home with her family. We were talking about two hours and enjoying our new fellowship. Actually we spent a fun time when we got together. One of things I always remember making Bird's Tab soup. I liked her soup whish she served on the dinner. She gave me the receipt when I exhibited my willing to that.
