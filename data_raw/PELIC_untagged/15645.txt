I went to skateboarding often and practiced to acquire new skills with friends. My mother wanted me to avoid doing reckless practice. I wish I had realized she was right. The other day I thought of rolling down a hill with a skateboard because downing the hill seemed to be easy. If I hadn't underrated difficulty of doing it this accident wouldn't have been happened. The skateboard slid much faster than I expected then I slipped off furthermore I was tossed out and impacted my face on the road because the thrust of the accident was large. If only I kept balance I didn't get a fracture on my nose. In addition I bled much more I thought and friends took me to the hospital. However the treatment of the broken nose was much painful than when I injured. I wish a doctor had given me a sedation shot when he replaced the broken bone. One thing that I liked was the face mask that put on after surgery. It was uncomfortable but seemed like the bat man's mask.
