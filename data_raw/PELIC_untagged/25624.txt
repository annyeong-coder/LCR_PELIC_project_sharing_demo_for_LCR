I think. Air pollution is a big problem because people can stop eating or stop drinking but the people cannot stop breathing. The air pollution is being created by industries cars and farms. The industries are a big group of air pollution because the industries make the dangerous gas. For example SOx NOx CFCs NH3 all of which can destroy people's health and the natural world. The cars and farms create a lot of CO2 that affect to decrease the world's temperature and destroy people's health. However Sciences try to create the industry's machine that don't create the dangerous gas or create a little of dangerous gas and the sciences try to create the new car that use the electric power and we should be use the products recycled.
