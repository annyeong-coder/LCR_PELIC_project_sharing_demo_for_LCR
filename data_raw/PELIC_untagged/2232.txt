I think good luck has meaning to do with success because if I don't have good luck I cannot get a chance to do successful thing. For example I could play the Arpa in my high school festival with good luck. First time teacher told me that students should play the instruments in the class but for the good luck students allowed to use a music hall I could play it in the music hall. For success we need hard working and it is really important. However with the hard working we need a good luck to do successful things. So I agree with this sentence.
