The worst meal I have ever had is the meal on the plane which was from Beijing to NewYork It was made up by beef and vegetables. I don't think they added any seasoning to the vegetables because all of them were tasteless. Vegetables contained potato pod and one kind of dishcloth gourd. They looked colorful however if you put them into mouth you would be disappointed. Beef was fine little salty. And it was hard for a beginner in the using of folks and knives to cut especially when the beef was one inch thick. Juice was excellent. Fruit on cakes was fresh but some of the cakes were too sweet. Ice cream looked tasty whereas I haven't chosen them. I think my home sicking took negative influence on my sense of taste but no matter how in my mind it was still a amazing trip.
