I agree with this statement that parents are the best teachers. There are two reasons in my mind that they provide you with an education in reference to speaking and writing and your parents teach you what can you do or can't do. The main reason is that parents provide you with an education in reference to speaking and writing. When you was a kid you never used to write any words or talk with anybody. Your parents are responsible for simply writing and speaking basics such as how are you or write your name and so on. They teach you simple basics before you go to school. The next reason is what can you do or can't do during in your life. They educate you to be behavior well. You should be obedient your parents and your elders. You must take care of your sibling. When they get a sick you need to take care each other. On the other hand you can't do illegal things such as do a burglar or criminal. Those things don't help you.
