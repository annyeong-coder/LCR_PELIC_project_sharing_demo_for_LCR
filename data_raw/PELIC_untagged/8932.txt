My friend Sachiyo whose husband is my husband's colleague lived in Pittsburgh ten years ago. She studied Art in the Pittsburgh University while she was staying in Pittsburgh. So she knew the Pittsburgh University very well where there is the Hillman library. She introduced me the library which has a lot of Japanese books. I love to spend my free time when I went to Oakland in the library and I can get Japanese current news through Japanese magazines. She also introduced me IWAP which means International Women's Association of Pittsburgh. Since last September I used to commute to the IWAP meeting which is held every Thursday morning but now I can't attend it because I have been studying English at ELI. I could meet a lot of friends and communicate with them who came from many other countries at IWAP. I appreciate her for introducing me many other information about Pittsburgh. She has been helping people who visit Japan from every country still now.
