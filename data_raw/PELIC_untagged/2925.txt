There are a lot of things which are important in our lives. It could be different from each person because we have our own thoughts and ideas. These threes could be in among the top 10. The first one is 'Positive Mind'. Whenever we do something for example doing important homework or doing a project the way of thinking is one of things which make our work success. Although it seems to be fail or wrong sometimes it turns into the success only have the positive mind. Of curse you have to do your best doing your job. The second one is 'Relationship with People'. We have relationships with family friends colleagues and even the members of some small social club. As you see we can't live without contacting people and it can't be ignored to think about relationships even if we don't want it. The last one is 'Money'. If we don't have the money we can survive now. We can buy some food clothes and stuffs we need in our lives by money. It's hard to measure the value of all the important things in our lives. It's too subjective for each person but it would be helpful for us to know these three things for our lives.
