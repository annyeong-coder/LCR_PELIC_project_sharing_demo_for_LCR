Names are words that identify every human being. A lot of people share common names others have their own and unique one which is also strange when you hear it for the first time. For instance some parents like to name their children with fun and unusual names. Case in point Apple Pilot Inspektor or even Zuma. Having a strange name can hurt the kid and makes his life miserable especially in social life and among people within his age at school. Kids with unusual names suffer a lot in their life. They are trying to find a way to avoid getting involved with the social life. For example they prefer staying at their rooms isolated from others rather than enjoying the beauty of life. That is because they don't want anyone to tease them or laugh at them thinking that they are just a bunch of losers with strange names. Children can be cruel sometimes and kids with strange names may face some obstacles when they go to school and practice their daily routine. Therefore the most difficult thing that a kid can face during school is to be treated badly and not having friends. Thus parents need to put themselves in their kid's shoes before giving them odd names that might get them on troubles they don't want to be involved in.
