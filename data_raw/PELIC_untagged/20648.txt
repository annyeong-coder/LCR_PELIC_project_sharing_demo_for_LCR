Everytime I get in my bedroom especially at night I feel some scary atmosphere as if ghost is going to show up soon. Because my home is separated into two floors partially and my bedroom is in the upstairs so I can see the dark side of downstairs making up strange energy. I start to walk around to get away the energy that brings me down but as I walk the floor keeps on making a loud sound like KKKiiick. However it's the only onething that I don't like in my room. I can tear down the darkness by just turning the light on. From that the structure of my home begins showing a wonderful view to me that I can experience two floors at once.
