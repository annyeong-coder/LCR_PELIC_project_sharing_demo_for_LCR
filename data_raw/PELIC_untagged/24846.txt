In addition for this movie he did curls to wear sleeveless vest since the character he played was an action guy. In another comic movie Zoolander 2001 he played as a top model. However the movie came out in 2001 just a few days after 9 11. They had discussed about whether or not to release it but Ben Stiller thought the fact that not making much money was the wrong reason and he thought everybody should have option of going to see a comedy. Also he played with his father Jerry Stiller in this movie and he said it was fun because his father's character in that movie was totally different with his actual character.
