Yesterday I went to supermarket I bought some food. I want buy a little fresh fruit. I bought many apples and bananas. I really want eat rice. So I bought a grant deal of rice. I bouygt several beans and carrots to go with my rice. And I want buy milk. I went to refrigerator. But there are a lot of brands. It's hard to decide. I asked my friend. She gave me a lot of advice. Than I chose one. Last I bought a few boxes of tissue. I bought a lot of things. I were so happy because I bought everything I wanted.
