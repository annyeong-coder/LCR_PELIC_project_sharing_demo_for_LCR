In my opinion I think the three most important things in life are my relagion family and my education. The first impotant thing is my relagion because we believe as a muslem that the people created to woreship the god. So I have to woreship the god. In addition after the someone day he she will go to a havean or hall it independs in your woreship. So it's my real goal. Then my family especially my parent because they are a reason for me to alife. And I have to thank them and return some of thier good they have done it for me. Then my education which is my future and my live without the education I might be nothing. So I have to take care of it. Finally I hope I'll successful im my three goals and reach them as well.
