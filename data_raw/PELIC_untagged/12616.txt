I'd like to live in the Manhattan. The city is very interesting to me because there are many kinds of food and fascinating restaurants and I can see a fabulous night view of Manhattan. I hope my apartment is located in center of the Manhattan and it is on top floor of a building because of a splendid night view of Manhattan during taking a rest. And I wish friendly my neighborhood who is woman similar age with me and who rides a Holly Davidson. If we have enough time the bright sunshine and a cool breeze we will often ride Holly Davidson to enjoy the weather out of Manhattan. If I live like that I will get terribly happy
