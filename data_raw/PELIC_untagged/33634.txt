When I studied in the high school my math is so bad that I got the low grades all the time. I was so worried about that and I prepared much homework and practice about mathematical every day to finish it. Day by day there was a little bit improvement in my math's grade. However with this kind of tiny improvement I was ill. The reason why I got sick is that I was too hard working and I cannot get enough time to do something to take rest such as doing exercise listening to music and sleeping. My parents found this problem and they talked to me about it. My parents said that I cannot do it in a such rushed condition and I should take it easy instead. After that I followed my parents' advice and I schedule my time suitable for my self so that I can leave time on amusement and studying. Finally I got the nice result both in my math's grade and my own lifestyle. So slow and steady wins the race. It's a truth.
