Smells Sell!!! In my personal experience I think that smell can change our mood and to entice you to do something for example when I go to the supermarke I perceive a smell some especific aroma inside of the store especially in the food seccion. The smell sometimes is like bread or cinnamon but normally is fake odor because when I go to the seccion food there isn't nothing whit this smell but once being there I can avoid to buy something like bread. For these reason I think that smell led by the nose and you walk into a odor trap.
