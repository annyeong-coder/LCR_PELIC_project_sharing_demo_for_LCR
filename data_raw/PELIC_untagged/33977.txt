When I was with Melissa in the middle of fourth avenue she was walking slowly. I was walking faster when I saw her. I told her if you fell down you should laugh instead of cried. She said okay I will. After that I and she arrived to the sidewalk and she said if you fell down you should ask me to help you instead of cry.
