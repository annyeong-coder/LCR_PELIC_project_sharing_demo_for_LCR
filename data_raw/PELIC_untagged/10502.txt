According to my writing error log I find that my weaknesses in writing are using wrong tense use wrong articles and making preposition errors. First I should pay more attention to the agreement with subject and verb. I also should review the tense section of the grammar. Second I should use articles carefully. In a week I just learned article part in my grammar class. It is a good chance to study this part again. Last sometimes I am confused with the prepositions. I think I should figure out how to use the words if I am not sure which prepositions should follow these words. I know proofreading is very important for writing a good essay. We can find mistakes such as verb tense punctuations and even typo through proofreading carefully. Also teachers' feedbacks can help me to know where mistakes are in my essays so I can correct those mistakes. I hope I can reduce mistakes in writing though keeping practicing and making corrections.
