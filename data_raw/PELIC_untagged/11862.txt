MUMU Writing 4 5 23 2008 Today I am going to talk about my favorite place to eat lunch in Pittsburgh. I usually eat lunch near the campus because during the week I do not have enough time to go far at lunchtime although I would love to go far. My favorite place is the cafeteria in Student Union WPU. First I like to have lunch there because you can find different kind of food and every day they change the menu. Second the prices there are cheep and affordable. Third you can find American students and you can stay with them. For me it is the best way to make friends and improve your English.
