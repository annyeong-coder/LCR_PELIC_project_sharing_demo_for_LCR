Last weekend I checked my kitchen. I found I had a little rice a few eggs and some honey. After that I decided to go to the supermarket. I got a lot of bread a great deal of rice and a lot of eggs. Next I went to the book section and I got several books. Finally I went to the cashier. There were many people in the line.
