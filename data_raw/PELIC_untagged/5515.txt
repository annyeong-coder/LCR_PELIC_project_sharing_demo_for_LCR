A time when I ran out of money I ever had an interesting experience with money was the first summer holiday when I went home from the university which I had been studying in. When I arrived a bus station it was half an hour before the bus schedule I wanted. I saw there were several book stores near the bus station. After I walked in one of the book stores I found three books I really wanted to buy. I bought the books without any hesitance. When I went back to the bus station I found the money I had was less than the price of ticket. However I could not return the books back to the book store. At last I had to walk home and it spent me three hours.
