If I were born in the United States I could speak English as a native speaker I would study medicine and work as a physician. If my parents had been born and raised in the United States I would have my family with me now. If I had grown up in the United States I would have created friendships since my childhood. If I had born in the United States I could have become an architect I like the buildings that this country has. I wish I were born in the United States because I could understand its culture better.
