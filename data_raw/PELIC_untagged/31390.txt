Pittsburgh is the city that surprised me when I came to. In fact What surprised me about Pittsburgh is its weather. In the other hand I read about Pittsburgh city before I came and I was willing about the fact that Pittsburgh has a lot of bridges. What is good about Pittsburgh is its people who are kind. That Pittsburgh has the ELI gives it a lot of beauty. If I am able to choose my graduate school I will choose Pittsburgh university. That Pittsburgh has high buildings amazed my wife.
