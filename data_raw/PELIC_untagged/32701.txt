I like my new place's design I'm living with an american family in a two floor house which consisted of 3 bed rooms one living room 3 bathrooms and a kitchen However I do not like how the living room appears. Something that I would like to make some changes to it is the arrangement of the living room I would prefer to throw some pillows away fix the big couch up then I want to turn it around Moreover I'm going to put the coffe table back bring the sound system back clean the carpet up Furthermore we could have a larger space in the living room if we move the PLAZMA T. V around. My roommate juana has the same impression Therefor it might be good idea to ask her to help me out when our landlord give us the greenlight to do so. I think I will team up with her to make some changes on the home.
