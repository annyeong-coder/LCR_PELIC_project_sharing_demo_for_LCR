After last ELI trip to the Heinz History Center I visited South Side with my Korean friends to go to a Cheese Cake Factory. It was my first visit but since then I started to like that place. First of all the steak that Cheese Cake Factory served was so soft and delicious and salad and soup had good taste. In addition bread that the restaurant served at first was complimentary and so sweet. Especially brown bread was so good. Although I couldn't try all the foods on the menu the foods other people were eating seemed to have good taste. Staffs in the restaurant were also kind and smiley. Finally the interior of the restaurant was cozy so I think that the restaurant would be appropriate to date with someone or to have lunch or dinner with family. This is why I like that restaurant and I'd like to recommend your visiting.
