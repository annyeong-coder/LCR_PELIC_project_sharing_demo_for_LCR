A Hurry hurry!! We don't have enough time to prepare. B First of all we have to find a place to sleep before the sun falls down. A Right. In desert the sun falls down early. If we don't find a place we might be frozen dead. A So what should we do next B It's hard one We have only a book of matches. Furthermore it's very hard to find firewood in desert. We'd better collect firewood as many as we can find. A Ok!! Let's do it!! We have only 2 hours to gather all things. We ought to hurry!! Before we'd got to take a bottle of water. If not I might be dead because of thirst.
