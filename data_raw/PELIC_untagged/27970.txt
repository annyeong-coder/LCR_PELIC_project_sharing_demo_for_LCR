the fact that suejoo wants to run a marathon was very surprising to me it took me a while to process that information. Whether she'll do it or not still shocking to me why she even thinks about it. The question is if Suejoo gets the opportunity to run it will she finished it. The fact that I have never hear or see a marathon from the country she is from is what made it difficult to understand. I wonder how Suejoo will prepare for this type of event but if she'll ever do it I will be her 1 fan. The fact that we don t receive enough information of athletic events from that part of the world is what made this unique specially coming from a woman. When she told me this I paused for a few seconds and than I reply what that really cough me of balance.
