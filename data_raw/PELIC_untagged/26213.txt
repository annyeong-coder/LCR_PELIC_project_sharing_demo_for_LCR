Yes. I would travel a long distance to see an event like Sapporo Ice Festival because this festival is truly amazing. Its richness variety and splendor. Copies of famous attractions from around the world such as Deo Castle in Japan Angkor Wat in Cambodia the Parthenon in Greece and the Britith Museum in England. They are impressively detailed.
