I've already invited people but I haven't borrowed some chairs yet. I've already cleaned the house but I haven't washed the dishes yet. I've already shopped for food but I haven't decided on a menu yet. I've already baked the cake but I haven't gotten the cookie yet. I've already bought the beer but I haven't bought the soda yet. I've already wrapped the gift but I haven't hung the balloons yet. I've already bought the flowers but I haven't picked out music yet.
