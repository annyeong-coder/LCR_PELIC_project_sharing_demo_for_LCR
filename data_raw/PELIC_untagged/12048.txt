Since I came to Pittsburgh I could compare Seoul which is biggest city in Korea with Pittsburgh which is one of famous cities in America. There are many similarities that are river weather and traffic jam. But there are also differences that are transportation and downtown. Many of people say that Seoul and Pittsburgh have several things in common. First of all the weather is one. Seoul has four seasons and Pittsburgh does too. In winter I saw big snow in Pittsburgh. I used to see heavy snow in Korea. When Pittsburgh was covered with snow it looks like my home city. Next Seoul has a river that runs though center of Seoul. Likewise Pittsburgh has a river that runs though itself. People of Seoul walk around the river with family and pet and people of Pittsburgh do too. Third traffic jam is the same problem in both cities. Seoul's roads and Pittsburgh's roads are similar to very busy because of many cars. Although both Seoul and Pittsburgh have similarities they also have differences between Seoul and Pittsburgh in many ways. First transportation is one of them.
