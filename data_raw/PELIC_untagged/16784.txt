The first met my best friend at Pittsburgh. Accounting to my friend and I were Testing pretest at the ELI I saw him because he sat in front of me. After that I was said Thai word. Than he was returning back and asking me did you Thai people And I said yes. After test we were walking to apartment together and were know edging each anther. I thought It was not until he was study in University that we were keeping this relationship forever.
