It seems that you have a complex problem. I think you have to consider some factors when you make a decision. First you should think which person is more important than other person. It doesn't mean you have to evaluate someone's characteristic. Generally parents are more important than boy friend. You can make boy friend whenever you want and don't have to disobey your parents. Another factor is the depth of love with your boy friend. If your couple confirmed love each other you had better say to your parents that you can't live without him. It is essential for you to persuade your parents by presenting the right reasons. Sometimes defining your position directly is the most effective way to solve problem. I'm not sure if you would conform to my suggestion because the final decision is your share. In my opinion however parents are always principal people and fiance is the second. I'm looking forward to hearing a optimistic news.
