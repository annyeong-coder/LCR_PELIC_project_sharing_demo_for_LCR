I used to go fishing when I was in university. It let me have break time without some anxiety. Sometimes I got big fishes. Since I have been here I haven't gone fishing because I don't have any fishing tackle. Even though I can buy it here I don't have time. However I have been playing judo since I was 20 years old. Nowadays I have been going Trees Hall every Tuesday where there is a gym to play judo. Actually when I go there there is class which is one credit for undergraduate students. Nevertheless I can practice judo because I also have been teaching judo with the professor and teaching assistants since this semester.
