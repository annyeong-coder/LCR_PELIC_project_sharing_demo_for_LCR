Trip with Athletics Handicaps Some people don't know about handicaps and how they live. Some of them think they can't do exercise or any type of sports and they live depressed live . Maybe a few of them. The accurate thing is a lot of them live normal live. They can get married they can drive cars they can create happy live and they can play some sports. They are similar normal peaple but they lost something . They can do several things. I am lucky because the Saudi athletics handicaps union chose me to be a physiotherapist with Saudi team for athletic handicaps. I lived with them month and a half . I ate with them I set with them I talked to them and I watched them when they were training . I lived with them twenty four hours for month and a half . We stayed in Saudi Arabia for month in the hotel and they were training. They trained because they had a compotation in India. Next We went to India before compotation started around two days. I surprised when saw the athletics handicaps from different countries men and women . I saw different deaf. It was amazing. There is something beautiful almost of them know each other and they have strong relationship. They communicate by internet. Next the compotation started. It was very strong . And every country wants to get gold medal. At the end of day the organizing was giving the medal to the winner. The compotation was ten days. Our team got seventeen medals in that compotation. After that we come back to our country with seventeen medals. Then I knew how they strong and can do something normal people can't do it. I enjoyed with them. Finally it was great experience to me.
