Internet provides us a wide variety of opportunity but when we use internet we must be carefully. In the reading passage Dr. Schwartz gives us very important advices about online dating. These advices are very clear. All advises are very important and necessary for me but the most important advice is that don't tell little white lies. Being honest is the most important rules when we connect some people over the internet because lies will appear at last. For this reason when we use internet especially online dating we should be honest. At least important advice is that don't do all the talking. People can enjoy expressing yourself. In my opinion some people enjoy learning background of partner.
