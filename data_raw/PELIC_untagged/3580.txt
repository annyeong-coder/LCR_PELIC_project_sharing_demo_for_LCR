I don't like rain. It makes me feel gloomy and feel more down than usual. I don't konw when I feel likt his but I remember I definately have hated rain since I wans really young. Maybe there are no good memories whenever it rains. I always wet my clohtes and my shoes are dirty. I totally agree with I ling. She said that she doesn't like rain too because of those reasons I mentioned before ahead. Personally I don't like humidity and sweat. Most rainy days make me have this kind of feeling and it's a bit hard to tolerate from time to time. When Ling who is my classmate wrote about the same topic Rain she said My friends told me they like to sleep on rain days. . I will never feel like what Ling's friends feel. In conclusion rain doesn't give me good emotions.
