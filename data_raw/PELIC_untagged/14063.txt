When I was studied in college. I was spent too much time study my major. My major need to study about the science of divitation. It was really hard for me and my class mates. Everyday I was studied in library after class and I tired to find a solution my self. However when I didn't understnad about a solution I spent lots of time for that question. I thought that how can I find a good solution about this question sometimes I passed by night without sleep for find a good solution. After this process I got a good guess when I recieve a strange question in my major test. And then I had a good creativity because test in the science of divination want to good creativity and good guess. So I think it is a good experience to me.
