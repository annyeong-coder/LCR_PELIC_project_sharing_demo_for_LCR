Types of Friends There are many different kinds of friends. Having them is a blessing from God because no one can live alone. Nevertheless not every one can be considered as real friend. We can categorize them in how much clause they are from us. In general the most three types of friends are clause friends normal friends and the colleagues or co workers. The first important type is the clause friends. This type is the friend who never leaves you alone and always with you. He or she is your best friend who knows everything about you even the smallest thing that no one would notice it. Either if you have one or more they enjoy what you enjoy and be there for you when you need them. Though there must be fights sometimes that may affect the relationship. But strong friendship will last forever despite any misunderstanding. Second most important type is normal friends. These are good friends but they are not clause as much as the first type and you may live without them. They can give you some help if you need and you have to call them. Also when you are bored you can talk to them and have fun sometimes with them. Moreover you can benefit from their experience if you need it. Of course in contrast with the first one this type of friends is busy sometimes and not all the time you can find them. The third and least important type is co workers or the colleagues. These are friends from work or from school they are not really friends but the place where you work or study makes you have them. They can help you in something related to work and figure out a problem you have. They can cover for you if you miss work and can have fun sometimes with them at work when you are bored. But sometimes they may make obstacles in your career. As a result we can say that friendship is a long trip that someone must distinguish the good from the bad ones and give more thinking about it.
