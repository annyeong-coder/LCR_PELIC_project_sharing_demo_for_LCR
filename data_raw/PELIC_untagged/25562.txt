Happiness What is happiness Why does everyone look for happiness Happiness is a strong feeling of personal satisfaction that makes life more wonderful. Even though everyone looks for happiness I already have it. In my opinion happiness is having good relationships with other people and feeling peaceful when you are alone. When I spend time with my family and friends we all are very happy. When I am alone I also feel happy and full of enjoyment. There are three things make me happy spending time with my family shopping with my sister and reading books. The first thing makes me happy is spending time with my family. No matter if we travel play at park or just have simple homemade dinner when we live together there is a lot of happiness. I enjoy spending time with my family doing some housework cleaning house and having BBQ parties because these activities make good memories for us. The second thing that makes me happy is shopping with my sister the whole day. Shopping with my sister can be really fun because my sister has very good tastes when picking clothes and good patience to shop the whole day with me. Even though people always say money does not always bring happiness every time I go to shopping with my sister we are really happy the entire time. The third thing that makes me happy is reading books in a bookstore. Reading books in the bookstore with romantic music is a very happy experience for me because it makes me feel very peaceful and full of enjoyment. I really enjoy the delights of reading book in the bookstore and listening to classical music. When I read in the bookstore I am really relaxed. I am delighted to read in a nice environment. In conclusion there are three things that make me happy spending time with my family shopping with my sister and reading books in the bookstore. I am very appreciative to have happy times with my family as they make me happy every day.
