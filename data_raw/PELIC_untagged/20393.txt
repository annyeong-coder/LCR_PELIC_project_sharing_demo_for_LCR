If this happened to me. I think I will take some fresh water to I can stay alive. Also I will take the fireworks to use it if someone looking about me. Also I will take with me an ax to use for cut some of the trees for cooking and others. Also I will take the matches to make a fire. Finally I think I will take a book navigating by stars to know where I. I hope that not happened to me.
