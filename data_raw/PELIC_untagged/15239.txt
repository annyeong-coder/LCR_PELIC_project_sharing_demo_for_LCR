I like to live in Pittsburgh because Pittsburgh has a different feature but also it has same aspect to my hometown. My hometown is Nagoya city middle of Japan. Nagoya city is people friendly and comfortable to live in. I would like to show you some of the things that make my hometown. I compare Nagoya to Pittsburgh in terms of entertainment climate and location. The first things Pittsburgh and Nagoya are great places to have fun. Pittsburgh and Nagoya have amusements of high quality such as a zoo museum and park. Also both of cities have a pro baseball team. In addition I think that people of Pittsburgh is as friendly as Nagoya's. Encourage by all of these factors I can enjoy leisure time. Next Pittsburgh's weather is distinct from Nagoya's. Pittsburgh is very cold in winter but Nagoya is pretty moderate. Pittsburgh has a heavy fall of snow. On the other hand Nagoya does not have snow compared with Pittsburgh. Instead Nagoya has rainy season and usually lasts for about one month from early June. Nagoya has a lot of moisture but Pittsburgh has dry weather. Another thing is their location. Nagoya besides the sea Pacific Ocean but Pittsburgh is located nest to the mountains. In summer I can play several marine sports in Nagoya. In contrast I can ski during winter in Pittsburgh. In addition both cities have several rivers and nature. I can live in good harmony with nature. In conclusion Pittsburgh and Nagoya have both good and bad points. I know the best of both cities.
