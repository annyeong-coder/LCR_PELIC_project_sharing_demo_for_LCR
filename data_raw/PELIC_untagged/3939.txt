A long time ago the wedding ceremony was very complicated in Taiwan. Nowadays even though the wedding customs have changed a lot people also keep some meaningful procedures because the marriage is the most important in a couple's life. If something does not be done well people believe that will influence their whole life. First of all the groom goes to the bride's home at an auspicious time and day with groomsmen. Then he tells the bride's parents today he will bring their daughter home and marry her. After the groom and the bride bow to the bride's parents they go back the groom's home with one or two bridesmaids. The bride's parents can not go with their daughter to the groom's home. If they change their mind and do not allow their daughter to marry him they can prohibit the groom from entering their house. When the couple arrive the groom's home the groom's relatives welcome them and tell them a lot good words which mean they will have a wonderful future. Subsequently the couple meets the male's parents and bows to them. After that the groom's parents will bring them to worship their ancestors. The action is meant to notify their ancestors about their son marrying with a girl. After worshipping they will have a ceremony party in a restaurant with their good friends and relatives. Usually the party takes place for lunch or dinner.
