Both Bach and Beethoven are the most famous musicians in the world. Bach was a German composer and organist. He was older than Beethoven. He's compositions are more classic than Beethoven. Beethoven who also was a German composer but he is between Classical and Romantic. He plays more aggressively than Bach due to his miserable childhood. Bach has more talent than Beethoven. In my opinion Beethoven's music are more inspiringly and excitedly than Bach's but Bach's music are more classically and marvellously than Beethoven's. I would like learn Bach's first for basis.
