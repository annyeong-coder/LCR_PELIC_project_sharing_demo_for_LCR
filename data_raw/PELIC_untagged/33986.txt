The Cathedral of Learning is a landmark of University of Pittsburgh. And it is the second tallest educational building in the world. It is also the geographic and traditional heart of the campus. If you have a plan to study English at the ELI you will study here. Furthermore you can use many facilities in it. On the other hand there are many problems because of old building. For example elevators often stop for some reasons and we must wait for a long time until restarting. In addition the elevators move very slowly. If we make an appointment to teacher we must go to elevators at least ten minutes before.
