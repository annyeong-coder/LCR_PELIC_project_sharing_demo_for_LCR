Despite the fact that working is very important to earn money and getting good salary I believe we should work less and have more leisure time. Some people argue that there is no time to go for vacation every year I think to produce more we need to get more rest and relax. In addition there is no benefits if we working hard without getting vacation with our families. I know my uncle he is very rich but he was living as a poor people. He didn't travel abroad or enjoy with his family. In contrast my brother he have normal job and he is always travel with his family and have more leisure time. Moreover if we work without getting more leisure time we will lose concentration in the work. This will affect badly at the end of the year if your boss will assess your performance to get bounce or promotion.
