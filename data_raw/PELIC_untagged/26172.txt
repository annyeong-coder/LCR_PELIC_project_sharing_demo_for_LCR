As a young student I was reluctant in learning new language. After the first English class my point of view was changed. I felt learning English would be my best hobby. Upon graduating from high school I determined to major in English . I spent four years studying English in the university without practicing. One day laying on sofa watching American movie I decided to retain learning English but from native speakers. Coming to USA I achieved the first goal which is studying English then teaching English as a second language.
