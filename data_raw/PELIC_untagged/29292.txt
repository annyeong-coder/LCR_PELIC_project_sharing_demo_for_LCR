If I had been a girl I would have played with dolls instead of cars. If I had been the opposite gender I would have worn earings. If I had been a girl I would have grown my hair long. If I were a girl I would dance a lot more. If I were the opposite gender I might go to beauty saloon every week. If I were a girl I would have a boy friend. If I were a girl I would wear a dress or a skirt.
