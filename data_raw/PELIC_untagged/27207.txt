Tomorrow I will go to a far island. I schould bring much food because I will stay there two weeks. I must have many battaries. I think I do not need any ax but I need to bring several maps of the area in order not to lose the way. I think I do not bring any compass. I have to bring much fresh water because the weather will be hot.
