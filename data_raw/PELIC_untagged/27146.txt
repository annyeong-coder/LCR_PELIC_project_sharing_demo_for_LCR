Two years ago I went to Germany about ten days by myself. My friend lived in Regensburg. She assisted me by bus and train. I visited Munich Nuernberg Bamberg Fuessen Heidelberg and Wurzburg. It was expensive to go to the restroom. I like ice cream and brezel and I think Taiwan beer is better than Germany beer. I love to travel but I always get lose. I usually ask where is train station .
