I wish I could insist to choose English as my major when I was a freshman. If only I majored in English I could have spoken English very fluency. I have had a dream which is speak English as a nactive speaker since I was high school. I wish I had a talent in speaking English that I can convey my idea without difficuties. Anyway I wish I were a American that I might have had a better pronounciation. If I had stuided hard I could have been accepted by some schools in the U. S. . And if I had choosen English as my major I wouldnt have been frustrated about my English. If I hadn't picked Business Administration as my major I would have a different life from now. I wish I could stop complain my poor English abilities and started to study now. If only I were a teacher that I won't need to do this assinment. Actually I am not really sad about learning English I like English very much. And I am trying to learn everyting as much as I can. I wish you would not misunderstand my really feeling.
