Long time ago after entering a middle school I had an experience that taught me intuition is sometimes important for my life. Looking back on the situation now I wish I had followed my sense. Choosing a middle school is really significant for pupils' future in Japan. If the middle school is eager in studies students are forced to study so they may enter a good high school and enter a good university. This process is kind of our purpose. In my case I was good at studying when I was a pupil. However I ignored my inner voice that I try to take an entrance examination for a smart middle school. That is why I couldn't be satisfied with my classes after entering the middle school. I wish I were brave and I had tried to take the entrance examination. If I had entered a more smart middle school I would have been more satisfied with studying.
