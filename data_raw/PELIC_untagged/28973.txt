My piece of advice you should have called him more often in the past couple of weeks. You ought to call him a few times in the next week and sense how he feels about you. You could visit him first and make sure he feels strongly about you. If both of you have same feelings then you should move in with him. You had better discussed your plans with your boyfriend before he moved to Minnesota.
