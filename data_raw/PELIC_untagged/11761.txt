Hillary and Bill have married since 1975. In addition their daughter Chelsea was born in 1980. Hillary served as Arkansas's First Lady for 12 years. She has been the United States Senator from New York since 2000. It means that she has been a senator for eight years. Also she wrote a book. This book It Takes a Village and Other Lessons Children Teach Us has been a best seller for many years. Some of her personal accomplishments are that she did many important jobs when she chaired the Arkansas Educational Standards Committee co founded the Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families and served on the boards of the Arkansas Children's Hospital Legal Services and the Children's Defense Fund. One of her accomplishments as a US Senator was that Clinton has served on five Senate committees Committee on Budget 2001 2002 Committee on Armed Services since 2003 Committee on Environment and Public Works since 2001 Committee on Health Education Labor and Pensions since 2001 and Special Committee on Aging.
