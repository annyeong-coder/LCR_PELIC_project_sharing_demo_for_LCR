When I was in high scool I used to be thin. I didn't use to care about my appearance so much. I was deligint student I wanted to study in medicine college. I used to work hard to be the first in my classes. I studied in differnt city. I didn't use to see my family every day. I used to be neat. I didn't use to watch Tv often. But after school me and my friends used to go play tennis I didn't use to win but I was intersted in this sport.
