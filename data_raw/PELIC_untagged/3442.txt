Mar 20 2007 Dear mother I 've received your letter for three days. I'm missing you. In this letter you said you want a pair of shoes for walking rest. I got a Ads paper about shoes yesterday. I'm planing to buy this kind of shoes for you. Generally I think the comfortable sandals or athletics is good for you. You will decide to choose which one you like. Well I have some comparsions for the two kinds of shoes. First of all the women's sandals are Route 66 but the women's athletics are all the Body Co secondly the sandals usually costs 12. 99 And the athletics costs 9. 99. Last sandlases' color include blue white and pink white. The athletics' color just include black white. However they are not include in the buy one and get one offer. Then mom. You can choose now. Tell me by call. I'll buy it for you soon. Love Your dauther fang
