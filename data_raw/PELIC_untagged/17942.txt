I'm glad you contacted me about Fred. The only think you can do is to try to talk to him again and write down some rules that is obvious for you and that he have to follow if you are going to live together. And I will talk to him his parents teacher and trainer that hopefully will change his behavior. And don't worry I'm not going to tell him that you told me. Take care And thank you I appreciate your honesty. Best regards Advisor
