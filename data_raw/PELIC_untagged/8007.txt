In Mexico we have a lot of different holidays and each one has a special food. Each state has a characteristic meal. My favorite holiday meal is tamales. You can prepare it in a very different ways and sizes and buy it in a restaurant or prepare at home. I prefer home made tamales with vegetables and chicken. To do tamales you need 'Masa' Cornhusks Fillings Steamer The first thing to do is get the 'Masa. ' You can buy it in a special place called 'tortilleria' or you can buy Tamales mix already prepared. Put the 'Masa' in a bowl and add shortening can be vegetable or pork salt to taste and mix until the dough is smooth. When the 'Masa' is ready put it into the cornhusks and spread it. Next add the filling. The filling are the most important ingredient because it give flavor to the tamales. You can prepare meat chicken vegetables beans or something sweet like raisins or strawberries. For the feeling I usually prepare chicken with vegetables. In a pot put chicken potatoes squashes and carrots and cook it until the chicken is well done. Add salt to taste and fill the 'masa. ' Now are ready to cook. Use a steamer and cook it for one hour or two. The time depends of the quantity and the size of the tamal so you can check after an hour and see if are done. Finally you can add beans side to the tamales and salsa and sour cream on the top.
