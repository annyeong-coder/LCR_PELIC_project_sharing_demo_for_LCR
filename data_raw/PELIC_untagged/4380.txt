My job skills I was working as a cashier in Saudi Diesel Company when I was in Saudi Arabia for three years and four months. I was working in that job in the part department which was very important department in that company. I had learned several skills during the three year and diverse things which I hadn't ever learned before I got that job. I had learned how to deal with the consumer from many different countries and economic status which was a little bit difficult because you are meeting with many people some of them are easy to deal with and some others were very difficult to deal with. Moreover I had learned some computer skills such as data entering and make a daily report for my boss. Furthermore I had learned how to do the banking jobs for my company and some time for my boss. The most important skills that I had learned is how to deal with diverse people because I feel that I can deal with anyone in this world from any different class and countries which is very important for me.
