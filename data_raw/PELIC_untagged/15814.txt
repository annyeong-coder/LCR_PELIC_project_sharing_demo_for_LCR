My room is so comfortable that I usually take off my cloth and sit down my favorite sofa when I go back into my room. Recently I found out spider's web on the wall. The spider's web let me down. I looked over all in my room. I go on keeping out bugs in my room. I don't give up until I leave bags out of my room.
