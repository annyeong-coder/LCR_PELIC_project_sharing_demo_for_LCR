Watching movies helps me relieve stress. When I am really stressed out at work I love to relax at home by watching 'the Schrek. ' I have watched the Schrek many times every time I feel more relaxed and at ease. Various characters of Schrek are really funny and silly. I love them. I can chuckle at watching 'the Schrek. '
