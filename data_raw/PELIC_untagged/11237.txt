My parents are different types of people. My mother is an extrovert and my father is an introvert. They often talk about the time when they just knew each other. At that time they were both teachers of a small elementary school where they have had a lot of romantic memories. My mother was very dynamic and attended a lot of activities in the school which made my father have a good impression to her. Though my father preferred to stay alone and did not talking a lot my mother still felt that he was cool and reliable. Then they fell in love and got married. Because of their different personalities they play different roles in our family. My mother is always the person who does most conversation works such as talking with my teachers communicating with neighbors etc. On the other hand my father always makes some decisions which are more significant to our family such as buying a new house going out for a trip etc. Although sometimes they have different opinions they deeply love each other and love me. My friends always say I am the lucky girl whom they envy very much. Actually I think the couples like my parents whose personalities are very different are more likely to keep the balance of their families.
