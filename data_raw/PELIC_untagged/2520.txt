Intendation My apartment is a cold hunted house. I live in a first floor of a somewhat rundown house. A quiet Chinese family live above me they are so calm but they make a scary sudden noise sometimes that sounds like rocks falling from the sky on the roof. My bedroom window faces the north makes the room an icy igloo. Therefore I spend most of my time in my living room. At the middle of the night the heater turns on making an earthquake every night. It makes a frightening loud sound vibrates the floor and wakens me. However the kitchen is the coldest place in my apartment. When I wake up in morning I blanket my self as if I am going outside to go to the icy kitchen. At 8 20 a folk of elephants cross by as I am ready to leave home. The train is not really close to my apartment but it feels like it crosses just by. Overall the place where I live is bitter and nerve racking apartment.
