On February 21 2012 my roommate and I decided to establish a time capsule and buried it under our home back yard in 219 halket street. The capsule consists of 6 items. We choose these items to explained who we are living these days. We put three tickets for soccer match to compare it with tickets price after 50 years. Also we put pictures of famous players such as Messi and Zidan to see if they were still remembering them as famous players same as now. We include also one I phone so they will recognize the difference between technology of cell phones. Furthermore we put Longman English dictionary book to show what types of books that we used to translate in 2012. In addition we put one dollar to show currency that we use it. Moreover we put one Rolex watch to compare it with watches after 50 years if there is any improvement in designing watch. All in all I think there are many differences between what we usually use these days and what we will use after 50 years.
