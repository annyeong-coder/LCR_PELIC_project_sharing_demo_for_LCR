If there is a time capsule I will put some video tapes and discs of movies and cartoons. Because I want the people who will open the time capsule to see how was the entertainment in our generation. Also I will put little samples of money. I want them to see our currency in that time. I will put a few candies. I want them to see how our candies look like. I will put a lot of toys. I want them to see how our toys look like. I will put a great deal of coke cans and water bottles. Because I saw people still keeping old cans and they sell it with a good prices. I recommend the people who will open the time capsule to wait at least 50 years to feel difference between their time and our time.
