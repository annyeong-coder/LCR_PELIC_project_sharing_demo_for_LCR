Living in illusion study hard to get what you want that's what I used to believe when I was 16 I finished my high school and I decided to go abroad to complete my education . I've got all the advantages to study supporting father who were willing to cover all the expenses a huge demand for the major and a close country to study. As soon as I finished high school I went to jordan to get the avionics engineering diploma then back to my country to get the perfect job in the perfect place . But what I was expectation wasn't true. The advantage some time turn to be disadvantage my English wasn't good to start a heavy major like the aviation and on the other hand my friend were all from my country so that I didn't get any benefit from being abroad one of the funny things that I did I remembered that after two months I came back to my country for only a weekend. When I started to improve my language there and read as much as I can When you had known your mistakes you wouldn't wait any body to correct it for you and that what I did. I started to red a lot speak in English as much as I can. When I did that every body recognized the improvement on me. Putting a plane is not the all matter what matters is accomplish it. I learned that if you wanted to do something work hard to get it right.
