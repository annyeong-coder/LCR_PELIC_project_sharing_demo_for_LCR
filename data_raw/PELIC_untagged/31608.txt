Peter Jennings who is a reporter in ABC News is trying to start an investigation about UFO phenomenon with many people in US which is called Seeing is believing . He started his report with a logic question which is related to the way that aliens used to transfer to the earth or other planet while the distance between planets is so vast. Because of the Einstein law that says nothing can travel faster than the speed light scientists say that aliens can't reach the Earth. Scientists start to explained an easier way to transfer by using the Wormhole idea. By using this idea and expoiling the power of stars aliens can make a shortcut to eas thier transfering way. But the scientists realize that if the aliens are million of years more advanced than human thay can use the wormhole as a shortcut.
