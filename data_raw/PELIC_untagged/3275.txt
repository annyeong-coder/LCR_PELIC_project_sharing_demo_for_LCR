ABHA Abha the capital of southern province is a very beautiful city in the Kingdom . It is the area where I used to take my vacation in . The area where green trees and cloudy weather are present in Saudi Arabia. I like Abha because my parents father and mother were born their. And my wife who is the center of my life still living in it. I think I don't like Abha because it's weather nor because of its nature but because the relationship between Abha's sand and trees and my ancestor's bones. One day I may form part of that sand which is virgin and muddy or I may form part of the grass who people like to see in Abha. Whenever I remember this I give my full respect to my ancestor the sand!! Whom I will be one day.
