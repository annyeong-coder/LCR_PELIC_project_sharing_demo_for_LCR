Octorber 27. I've been on the Canary Islands for three days now. I'll start home when the weather is better. I was so surprised when I pick up my mail today. My family sent some present to me. My birthday is the 31st. Octorber 29. I think the weather is getting worse. I heard thunder today but there wasn't much rain. Tylands and stayed in bed. I started reading Brave New World. October 30. I left the Canary Islands today justlike Columbus. There's a strong wind and plenty of sunshine now. I went 250 miles. October 31. I'm 21 today. To celebrate I drank little coffee for breafast and I opened my presents. I got some perfume and some pretty silver jewelry. November 1. The electricity are low. I'd better save them until I get near land. I'll need the radio then. It rained today so I collected a little water for cooking.
