I will write a bout my home especially the livivg room because there are many things to do with it. First I would like to take away some pieces of furnituer in my living room because they are old. Second I will go to a store to pick out some new pieces. Then I will add some lights to light up the room. Also I have a big sofa and I will move it around to give more space. After that I will straighten it up to end up feeling happier in my home.
