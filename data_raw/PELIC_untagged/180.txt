How I feel im my home In my home me feeling is so wendorfull. When I get on to my home I forget any bad things I have. Me home always clean up because my family live with me. So I don't have to clean up me clothes or room because they will do it. Also they take care about me food I don't have to find out about the food how to make it. Also I can come up with me friends any time. In addition if I need any things from a resterant or a markt I can call them up and they will deliver it. Also I can go back any time even it's too late. So these things make my feeling great. I hope I will go bake home as soon as I can.
