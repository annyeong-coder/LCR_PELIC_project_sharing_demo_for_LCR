I think there are some of the disadvantages of teaching young children business skills and strategies. First some children will not want to be a businessman in the future. Second children learn about how to be a good person is more important than how to be a good businessman. Third business skills is too difficult to children they should spend their time playing. Therefore I disagree to teach young children business skills and strategies because of some disadvantages.
