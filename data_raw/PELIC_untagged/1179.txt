The best meal I have ever experienced in Pittsburgh had happened at an American restaurant on Mt. Washington. One of my father's friends has lived in Pittsburgh. His family invited my family to the restaurant. My family felt a little lonely at that time because there were few acquaintances in Pittsburgh. I also didn't know well how attractive Pittsburgh was. When my family met his family at the restaurant for the first time we were warmly received. When we started the meal I had steak and a glass of wine. My steak was quite good. In addition I could enjoy a great night view of Pittsburgh. I realized new attraction of Pittsburgh there. After then I have often invited my friends to the restaurant on Mt. Washington. It is the best place to celebrate a special day and to make a pleasant memory. Until now I like the place and the meal the most in Pittsburgh.
