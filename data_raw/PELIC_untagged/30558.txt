Cell Phone Cell phone has changed our life. It has many effects. Some of them beneficial and some are harmful. I believe that cell phone is not like a face to face meeting. Making a call by a cell phone does not have the benefits that a face to face meeting has. Cell phone makes our holidays sad. Usually people in a holiday meet and have fun together but now they call each other or text each other instead of meeting. That is a really bad effect. The communication in our life has been decreasing. One the other hand cell phone has some useful functions. It makes our life easier. You can call whoever you want and wherever they live. Also by using the internet in a cell phone you can access to whatever you want as long as there is network. In addition a cell phone is a good thing for parents.
