ANON_NAME_0 is 55 years old and he is blind . His blindness doesn't stop him to do what the normal people can do . He is able to walk alone wherever he wants by using his stick . He can wash his car. He can fix some electronic devices . Once a day I visited him at his home and I saw him fixing the remote control . I was surprising and I couldn't believe that he can fix it but he could .
