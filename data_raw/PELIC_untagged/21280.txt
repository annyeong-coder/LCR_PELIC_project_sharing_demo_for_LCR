As being a non native speaker sure that I have my own English pronunciation that is Thai. I think I am a little bit lucky that my pronunciation is not too bad to make a conversation with the native speakers. Also I can understand the broken English that some of the non native speakers said especially with the Thai people. Now I'm living in the U. S. Live my life among the native speakers. I tried to brush up my English speaking especially the pronunciation and learn some idioms that most people use. Eventhough I never had a bad experience with my English but sometimes I do feel a bit nervous when I was surrounded by Americans. Once that I've been to a party with my friend. All of them are native speakers I was pretty nervous at that time because I was afraid that I woouldn't be able to say what I really want to say. I was afraid that they wouldn't understand what I mean because I know that my English is somehow be limited in some way vocabulary and tense etc. Also worried that they would look down on me that I have poor speaking skill. I know that at this time I couldn't speak a perfect English like native speakers. However my goal is to speak English as clear as I could and also be able to use English properly and fluently either when I speaking to the native speakers or when I speak to the non native speakers.
