How were the great pyramids built in Egypt I have heard from my father about that question. I think the pharaohs have built the pyramids within very long time because they were working with their hand. They might have used special tools to help them arrange the stones. The stones that they used to build the pyramids might have been carried by five persons of the pharaohs because of the size of the stone. They must have been a strong people. In these days scientists should debate each other about many things related to the pyramids. Pyramids may be significantly more controversial subject in the future.
