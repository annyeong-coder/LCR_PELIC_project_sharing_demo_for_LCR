Stadying English with naitve people effect on your skills. First of all you will use your own vocbulary when you don't know the spicific vocbulary. In addition you can't learn the correct pronunciation because your native doesn't have that. Also you will be shy when you make any mistake in your speech. For all that reasons stadying English in group contacts of same nationality is bad way to learn English.
