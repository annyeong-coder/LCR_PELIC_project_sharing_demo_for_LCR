Two heads are better than one Working as a group is always better than an individual. Last week my friends and I went to a soup kitchen to serve food to people who can't get food easily. First we prepared the place for them. Next we ushered them to their tables. Then we served them the food. Finally we cleaned the place. So we didn't feel tired because we worked as a group.
