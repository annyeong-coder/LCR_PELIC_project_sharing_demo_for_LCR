In the past few years there were no much changes in my family. One of the changes is that we became a smaller family than before. What I mean that we usually live in the same house together but now my brothers and I we've gotten out from the house because we got married. I've been in that house for all my life. Now I'm here in Pittsburgh and I've been here for 2 months. I haven't been away from the house before. So I missed it a lot.
