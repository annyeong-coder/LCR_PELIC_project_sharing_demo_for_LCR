Hi Carol I will tell you how I met my boyfriend. It was at Bogota Colombia in December of 2008. I was in a party with my classmates and Leonel was in there. I realized that he was seeing me. I felt me nervous but I was decided to talk whit him. While I decided it my friends were dancing and they were entertaining. I was walking toward him when my friend told me Think about it better but I thought. It's now or never. I started introducing myself and I realized he was really shy. But then we were knowing about each other and he was more comfortable with me. He had some dates as cinema dinners and finally we decided to start a relationship together. I met his family and he met mine. My parents loved him specially my mom who said Leonel looks good guy mature and responsible. After 4 years we are still together and I think he is very special for me because he is lovely friendly confident and funny . He lives in Pittsburgh too studying a masters degree at Duquesne University in music performance. He is a musician as me and I think the music is our big common thing. We have planned to get marriage later because now we want to improve our language and to get our degrees in music.
