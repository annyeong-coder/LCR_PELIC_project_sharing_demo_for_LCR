Being study in Harverd I got an excellent job. Having pass the IELTS exam I start studying I Pitt university. Having been graduated from high school I enter the university. Living in the USA I had different lifestyle. After studying for a longtime I went to shopping mall. Having a good score on my tests I had a celebration. While being in USA my family moved into a new house. Before leaving my home I promise my family to study hard.
