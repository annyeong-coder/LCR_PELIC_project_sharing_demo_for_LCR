There are many studies assume that it may be scientists discover another habitable planets beside the Earth in our own solar system. One of these scientists is Stephen Dole who published a document that study nature of worlds and how to find places around other stars which is appropriate for humans life. Another scientist ANON_NAME_0 Laughlin discussed the size of other planets and how the size is a relevant factor. The result of this discussion was the numerous increasing of the habitable planets. However the distance from our planet to these planets is more 500 light years. Then the author mentioned some factors that the Earth have and should be in other planets in order to obtain habitability. These factors are atmospheric content orbital shape and tidal energy input. Finally these days some scientists go back to Dole's analysis that said 5 of our solar system might be habitable planets.
