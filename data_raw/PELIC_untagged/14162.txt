Two weeks ago I went to Pittsburgh zoo with my family by taxi. The taxi driver told us that the traffic might be very bad on the way to the zoo. However we have been there early. The zoo was too crowded because entrance was free. We saw monkeys lions tigers snakes fish and many kinds of animals. My kids enjoyed the zoo and had a lot of fun. On the other hand. The weather was very nice there was some clouds but the sun appeared for a long time. We had our lunch in a resturant. My kids ordered burger and popcorn. My wife and I ordered chicken and rice. After that we came back home early because my kids had some homework to do.
