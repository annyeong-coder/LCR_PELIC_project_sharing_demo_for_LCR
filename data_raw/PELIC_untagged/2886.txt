Donald and his family were traveling last weekend. His house was broken into late Saturday by two people. The house was being watched by them for one month. Last Friday they saw Donald arrange bags in the car. So they noticed that he'll travel and they waited until Donald was gone. The thieves went back home and got ready for Saturday night. After the sunset on Saturday they drove to D. House and it was being watched by them until 10 pm. Then the guys broke the back door and got inside the house. The lights was turned off and nobody inside except the thieves. They started searching for Valuables and after few minutes Donald's safety box was seen by them. The safety box was opened by using some tools. The men saw jewels inside the box. After just one and half hours all the valuables were taken and the two men were left the house. On Sunday late afternoon Donald and his family came back to their home and directly went to bed. They didn't notice that their house was broken into last night. Monday morning D. Wanted to take some papers from the safety box. When he went to the box he saw that it was broken. Then he realized that his house was entered by someone. He directly called 911 and told them about the robbery. After few days the thieves went to jewelry store to sell a watch that was stolen from D. House. Donald was already mentioned that watch to the investigators. So the sells man told the store guards to catch the thieves. They were taken to the court and were questioned by the judge about the robbery. Finally they told the truth and they were taken to jail.
