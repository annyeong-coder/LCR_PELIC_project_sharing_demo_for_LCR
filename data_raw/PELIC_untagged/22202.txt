I am from South Korea. Most people of the world probably know Seoul capital of South Korea. In Seoul there are many interesting facts. First of all I recommend that you should go to the Namsan Tower where you can see most beautiful scenes of the city specially at night. Insadong small area in Seoul has Korean culture facts. There are many arts playings and so on.
