I met my friend Ki hoon while I was working out at gym. He asked me about clubs at university where I attended. I was a member of martial arts club. So I explained the club that I belonged. My friend who is also a member of the club while ki hoon and I were talking with. My friend helped me explain. After that ki hoon came to my club to join while I was exercising. He became a member like me and we learned KENDO togther.
