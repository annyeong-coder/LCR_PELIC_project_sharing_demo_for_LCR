I have read news about my countries that it's interesting to know. According to Sabq website there was an accident in the Almadinah airport while airplane was lending it moved out of landing path. After airplane stopped all passengers were safe. Another report someone worked as taxi driver found money for rider in his car after he arrived him to his destination. Finding money he went back to rider's destination but he didn't find him. Not finding him he went to police office. After a police officer took money he called the rider. Coming to the police officer the rider gave the taxi driver one thousand and five hundreds dollars as reward for his loyalty. As the rider gave the taxi reward he didn't take this reward. Another sadly reports is that a child whose age is 3 years took his father's gun to play. Playing by the gun she shot herself. After she shot herself his father took her to a hospital but she died.
