Before I got the position as marketing executive or planning I had approximately sent 20 companies my resume to apply for it. However my education background is no connection with business management and I have no career experience with marketing and advertising so it was really hard to find my ideal job at the time. But I had never thought to give up my dream before I succeeded. I had been trying to revise my resume over and over again to show my strength and enthusiasm about marketing field and highlight my experience about girl scouting in each interview. Because I had successfully planned and held scouting activities several times I thought that it could prove my ability to be a good marketing executive. Finally in 2005 my dream came true! I got my first job as a marketing executive in a Linux system company.
