I had an interesting experience playing violin. I'd never even been to classical musical concert before. It was 2010 when I Listened to my frinds When they were playing violin and they cheerd me up to play violin. Afterwards I started practicing on violin. As soon as I started practicing on violin I felt violin does not apply to me. By the time it ended I had been frustrating for 4 years. I changed my opinion because I was not good at violin. I had always listined abut violin and how much it is easy to play violin but when I played it I started to appreciate how much it is difficult.
