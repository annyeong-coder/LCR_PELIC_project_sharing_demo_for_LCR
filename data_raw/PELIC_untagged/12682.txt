Dear F. U. W. P. Thank you for your letter. I think it's really a serous matter. If I were you I would say plainly that I don't like her dog poop in my garden. But Iunderstand you. You don't want to break your friendship. I think it's a good idea you should suggest that she carry baggies with her. But you should be very careful. Otherwise you may lose your friendship. I suggest that you tell her you dont like dogs. You ask her not to bring her dog when she comes to you and tell her if so you would be very happy. Or with the help of another friend you can do it easily. Tell her to say that without mentioning your name. If she is intelligent she will understand and stop it. If not you challenge yourself and clean it up next time infront of her. Eventhen she continues make me know I will try to talk with her. Hopefully
