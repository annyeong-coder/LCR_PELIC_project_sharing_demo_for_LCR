ANON_NAME_0 is my friend that lives in England now. She is a person who has good personality. She is also enthusiastic to assistant people who need to help. She studies graduate school and her major which is related with international business. She told me London was a big city which has lots of people. Also there were some famous places that were worth looking. She invented me to visit whose home is in London when I had free time. In addition I could stay where she live and she would show me to taste the England culture. I probably fly to see her after the ELI class.
