Remembering Veterans on Memorial Day Memorial Day should be remembered by entire world citizens. This enormous loss of people in the several wars is the responsibility for all of us. Even thought those wars had happened inevitably due to the death of precious life and the loss of social resource we need to remember and try to alleviate possible disaster. I went to cemetery with my friends yesterday. I saw many people who were planting flowers and who were fixing flags in front of the veterans' graves. The people in the cemetery might have been suffered from death of their family. Although I am not related with any person in the cemetery I tried to remember as a world citizen.
