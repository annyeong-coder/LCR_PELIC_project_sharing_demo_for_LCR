I never imagine similar him I think men and women must live in same societies because if man and women live sparate societies in the world decrease population. They must learn about together. Such as when I was high school we were separate school but after school we were playing together in the neighborhood. So I think man and women are which is couple. If in the world didn't have the man women would work similar man. But If the world didn't have women man wouldn't work same women. For example man couldn't takecare children. Some family parents were divorce women can takecare children but if women die man couldn't takecare children because the man weren't women he wouldn't know how to takecare children.
