I think that maybe I will start my business as Roddick started her business because first I think that her thoughts and goals were different and not the same as a typical entrepreneur. Second she did not worry or disadvantages to start her company with almost money. However she was intelligent to use recycle things for bottled her cosmetics. Third the best thing that she is doing it is to help poor people do campaigns to protect animals and rain forests. In my case I would not modify anything because I will continue the same Anita's purpose that it is not just making money but also I will contribute to help and find solutions of the problems are facing the world today.
