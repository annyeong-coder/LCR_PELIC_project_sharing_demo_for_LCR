It is exactly 7 months after I paused my job as a head of a bank to join my husband to come with him to the US. Las week Mr. Braun the substitute of mine asked me for help to make a decision. As our receptionist for our commerce clients quit her job he wants to give this job to one of our employees Lisa or Petra. As he isn't sure who is the more qualified one he asked me for my opinion. Although I had worked with both of them many years I couldn't make up my mind who of them is the more qualified one. It was only after I analyzed the similarities and the differences between the two employees. I finally came to the decision that Lisa is the more qualified one. At first it seems that they have a lot in common. Both Lisa and Petra are 30 years old and have been working at the bank since 10 years. They are also similar in their appearance which means that both know how to dress for business. Most importantly both know how to dress for success. When I looked at the differences between both ladies that I made my final decision. In terms of punctuality there is a big difference. Lisa was always on time and more reliable but Petra was sometimes late with feeble excuses. While Lisa has been attending every meeting to gather new information Petra rarely had have time to attend these meetings. Although our bank is known for being friendly and kind I remember differences too. Lisa was always friendly to our customers and obligingly. On the other hand Petra was sometimes unfriendly and I had to listen to customer complains. The most important factor in making my decision was the difference of the know how between both employees. Lisa is more well rounded. In conclusion after taking everything into consideration I think I made the right decision to suggest Lisa as the appropriate successor. As it is the key in our business to combine know how with sense of smart appearance.
