Dear Mr. ANON_NAME_0 I don't know if you notice the situation at the EFL Computer Training Institute or not. It's a terrible mess! Would you mind if I offer some advices to you I hope you wouldn't because you will lose all your students if you still don't do anything to raise the Institute's quality. First of all you should empty the trash and clean the space. You'd better NOT admit students eating or drinking anything in the Institute because the food and drinks are the basic problems to mess up the Institute. Second you should repair the Institute. You should fix the broken window ceiling and walls. Also you should fix the photocopier. Third you ought to buy enough desks chairs and computers. You shouldn't have ONLY one computer in the Institute. Nobody likes to wait when they have to do a lot of homework online. Last I think you'd better appoint a manager to manage the Institute. I hope these advices could help the Institute get better and keep the students. Sincerely ANON_NAME_1 ANON_NAME_2
