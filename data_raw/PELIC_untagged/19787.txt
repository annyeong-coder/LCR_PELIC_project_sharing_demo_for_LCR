On the economy we've made little A LITTLE progress but we still have a great many DEAL OF work to do so there are several measures I'm proposing. First I want to rise taxes on the very wealthy because a few FEW of them are really paying their share. Second many of THE members of the middle class are carrying an unfair tax burden so I'm asking for a tax cut for the middle class. If I'm successful most of you in the middle class will be paying 10 percent less in taxes next ear though A few of you in the higher income group may see your taxes rise A little. How do I intend to make up the lost revenue The problem with the national income tax is that there are much MANY loopholes in the current law which allow any SOME people to avoid paying any taxes at all I want to close these loopholes. My additional plan is to replace the lost revenue with a national sales tax which is fairer because it applies to every ALL people equally. Third we have no money to finance health care reform and we've made a little LITTLE progress in reducing pollution and meeting clean air standards. Therefore I am asking for a 50 cent a gallon tax on gasoline which will result in many more people using public transportation and will create additional revenue. Thus we will have enough of money to finance our new health care program and will help the environment at the same time.
