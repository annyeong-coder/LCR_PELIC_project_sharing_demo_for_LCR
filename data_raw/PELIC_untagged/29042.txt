Since I needed to reach 100 points at the Toefl to be accepted in the master's degree I wanted to do in Switzerland I decided to go to the USA to improve my English. Some people asked me why I hadn't chosen to go to England. I answered that I didn't want to stay in Europe because I would have too many contacts with French speaking people. I added that I wanted to discover the USA and the life in an American University. Then some people also wanted to know why I had chosen Pittsburgh and where I would live there. I answered that my parents had friends in Pittsburgh and that I could stay at their home. Finally a friend asked me if I could bring him back some clothes from American brands since they were much cheaper in the States than in Switzerland. I told him that I agreed and he wished me a good journey.
