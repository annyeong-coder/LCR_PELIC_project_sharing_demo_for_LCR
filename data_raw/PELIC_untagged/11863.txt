My favorite place to eat lunch in Pittsburgh is Mama Lucia's. It is an small comfortable and casual Italian restaurant. First of all the dishes are all delicious. Specially saltinbocca Italian hot sandwitch is my favorite. My daughter likes to eat meatball spaghetti one of my friends recommands ordering wedding soup. They also serve original Sicilian izza since 1974. Moreover the price of dishes is not expensive. For example it costs 1. 90 For a piece of plain pizza 2. 95 For a bowl of soup and 6. 95 For a plate of spaghetti. In addition we don't need to pay for tax because of self system. We can save the tax money. It is located in the Northway Mall Which has Border's book store Marshall Dicks and severial small shops. It's convient to shop after or before having lunch at Mama Lucia's. My apartment is close to the restaurant so I often have lunch with my daughter. Especially I have a reason that I like it for My daughter'name is Lucia. I like to eating fot lunch with my daughter in Mama ucia's.
