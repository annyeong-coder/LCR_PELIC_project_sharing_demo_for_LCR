It is undoubtedly true that the automobile is the greatest invention that has even been made. Owning a car provides many benefits in the life of people. There are many reasons to agree with this statement there of which I will explain in the following paragraphs. In the firs place advent of automobile definitely made the life easier and faster. Imagine your child is suffering from a fever bout in the middle of the night. Would you call a friend in the dead of the night or would you try to find a taxi What if you were living in a place where no taxies were available In this case rushing your sick child to the nearest hospital in your car would provide the quickest solution. Also having a car would provide finishing all tasks at excess hour. If you want to finish a lot of tasks and want to go different places in the daytime you should take a car. Another reason is that being able to travel long distances by car is a real convenience because having car means you are not confined to a particular timetable as seen in the case of public transport such as buses trains etc. If you travel by private car you can decide to set off time freely and you can arrive early. Besides the comfort you enjoy in the car cannot be compared with any other means of transport. Who would like to travel in stuffed stinky and noisy buses Last but not least having a car surely cuts the extra expenses that a family spends on transport. What I would like to emphasize here is that travelling the some distances by car many cost much lower than travelling bus or train. For example if you travel by caravan you don't have to pay hotel price. Generally the price of roadside hotel most of them built on the tourist road is very expensive and the poor quality hotels are not suitable for family. As a result all the reasons I have mentioned above clearly supports the idea that owning a car facilitates the life of people and provides many benefits none of which is indisputable.
