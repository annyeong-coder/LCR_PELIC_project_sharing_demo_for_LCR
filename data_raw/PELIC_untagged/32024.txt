sometimes a little friend is a great friend. Such as my cousin . He is my friend . He has been in the U. S. For 4 years and he has experience in the U. S. . His name is Hosam he is 12 years old . He is a smart boy . When I got to the U. S. He assited me with alot of things for examble one time in a restuarant I did not know anything about the American Food he explained for me some kind of food and he choosed for me a delecios meal . He assisted me with my english befor I began in the ELI . He tought me alot of vocabolury . He tought me how to make friends in the U. S. . He gave much advice . I relly like him . But he does not speake arabic through he is saudi but along time since he left his hometown that's why he forgot his neative languege but he will go back to his hometown wich is K. S. A but when my uncle finish his PHD degree . Sometimes he joke with me he is really funny . The good thing about little friend that you can do something wrong such as smoking going to a bar and do other bad things . I just can play with him soccer or the game he is like wich is basketball.
