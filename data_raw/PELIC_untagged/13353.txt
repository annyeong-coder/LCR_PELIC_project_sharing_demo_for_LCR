Student's First Name is my first name and ANON_NAME_0 is my family name but every one in America calls me Mumu. I'm from Tunisia North Africa. I came to the United States to study. I live with my cousin and we go to school together every day. I'm studing English right now and after two month I will study international business. I go to the gym three days a week but this periode I'm playing tennis with my friend. I go out every weekend with some friends but this weekend I stayed at home because I felt bad but now I'm feeling bettre.
