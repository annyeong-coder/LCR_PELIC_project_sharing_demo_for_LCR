I have read the quote the Diane Arbus. I think it means a name and like a last name. I have felt the same way go where I have never been . I have been a different countries like Guinea Mali Mauritanie Bissau but only one time for each country . I have never been in Autralia and I hope to go there my next trip. I would like to visit Sedney because I have seen in the television and I have felt exciting.
