At this weekend First I will clean my room and go laundry. Then I will do my homework and have lunch. In the evening I will go to the Thai restaurant with my cousin and meet my cousin's friend there. I like eat Thai food especially tomyum because It is spicy. After that I will go to shopping at Store. And then I will back home and watch television together. Finally I will read story book before I go to bed.
