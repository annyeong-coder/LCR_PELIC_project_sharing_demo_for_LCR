I think getting of nuclear weapons is an important issue because it is dangerous for human beings. We know how is the impact of nuclear weapons. For example the nuclear bomb at Hiroshima. This bomb was the first and we hope it would be the last. This bomb destroyed the city in a short time. So I think it shoud be a law that prevent all countries from having nuclear weapons to live in a secure world.
