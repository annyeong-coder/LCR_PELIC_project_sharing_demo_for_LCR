I worked a bakery and a private school when I was university student. The bakery and the private school had several things in common. First of all both my place of work gived one's service. Next the bakery was the same work time as the private school. Both I worked from 2 p. M to 8 p. M on weekday. Finally both place of work worked at a salary of one thousand a month. In addition both had several things in common the bakery and the private school differ in several ways. First the bakery was more distance than the private school by bus. I spent one hour from my home to the bakery but I spent 10 minutes from my home to the private school. Second I made many colleagues at the bakery. On the other hand I didn't make a colleague at the private school because there was nobody to except a rector the same time. I enjoyed both I always reminisce both.
