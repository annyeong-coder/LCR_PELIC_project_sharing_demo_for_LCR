British merchants established a trading post in Singapore in the early nineteenth century. The good international communications and new institutional structures were needed to facilitate develop and control foreign investment. An economic committee was established which concluded that Singapore should focus on developing as a service centre. Although it is already a major city the current development plan seeks to ensure Singapore's continued economic growth through restructuring to ensure that the facilities needed by future business are planned now. One of the new features of the current plan is the lower housing densities will put considerable pressure on the very limited land available for development and this creates problems for another of the plan's aims which is to stress environmental quality. Environmental policy is therefore very much concerned with making the built environment greener by introducing more plants. Much of the environmental provision for example golf courses recreation areas and beaches is linked to the prime objective of attracting business. In conclusion the economic development of Singapore has been very consciously centrally planned and the latest strategy is very clearly oriented to establishing Singapore as a leading 'world city'.
