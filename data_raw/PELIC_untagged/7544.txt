Three years ago I requested for registration in biggest oil company in my country. In fact when I met a director he asked me about general information I was really upset and surprised upset because I didn't answer all questions which he asked me and I was surprising because he should have asked me about oil information or he might have asked me about my major is computer programs. In fact these questions were difficult. In fact I couldn't have said him must ask me about oil information because he'll answer me at that time not your business.
