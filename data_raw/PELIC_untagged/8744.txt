I want to talk about my best friend who lives in Korea now. We met 10 years ago with an introduction from another friend who was studying with me in the same university. At the first time my best friend who was wearing somewhat ridiculous deep green overcoat just like a soldier seemed an odd person. At that time she didn't care about other people who gazed into her abnormal appearance and acted as her pleases. She liked only the people who can understand her thought and personality. Actually she is a really smart and interesting person even though she looks somewhat odd. I've never met a person who is enthusiastic about his or her life like her. Now she is a promising youth in her company which is one of the best companies in Korea. We have shared a lot of good memories since we met each other. I really like her whose smile is really warm.
