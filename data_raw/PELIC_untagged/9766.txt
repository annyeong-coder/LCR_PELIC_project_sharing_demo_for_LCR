Hi I'm Elian Last Name . I've been working in my website for almost one year and I really like it because I can show pictures to my friends about the experiences that I am actually living. Also they have been writing in my pictures questions or comments about what they think that im doing in the picture. My website has a lot of stuff that you can deal with my friends have been sending me 2 kind of messages one kind of them are in my wall and all the people can see them and I have an inbox and those are just for me anybody can read them. They also can send me gifts or sticky notes and and they draw some things for me. About the information that I have in my profile is not a big deal I just can write in wich city I am living now my birthday what kind of relationship I'm looking for and if I am single so I think is a save website because I don't have like really important information but a have enough information to start a conversation or receive some messages.
