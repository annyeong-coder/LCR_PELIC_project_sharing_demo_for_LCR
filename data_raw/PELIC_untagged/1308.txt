If you want an ambitious president you should vote for me. If I win these elections I will be the one who fights to obtain all our rights. If I win I will ask for more days off. If I succeed in this election I will support allowing beverage in class. If you vote for me I will be your sound for the teacher. I'll assume if you choose me a lot of things are going to change. If you are satisfied with my plan you will be happy with the result. Please don't forget to support me
