Four months ago I went to Los Angeles with my family. It was a short trip for only four days. We arrived to this city on Friday night. On Saturday we went to a church. After dinner we rode to the Pacific Ocean. Next day was very interesting we visited the Disneyland. We saw many attractions and a lot of shops. Our last day we went to see Hollywood. We saw several beautiful buildings. Most of people were wearing nice clothes. A few of this people was looked like models. We saw one street with specials stars. I took enough pictures with these stars. We bought a few souvenirs. It was the nice trip with good weather.
