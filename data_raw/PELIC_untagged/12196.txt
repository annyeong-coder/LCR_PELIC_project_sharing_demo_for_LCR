Things often don't turn out the way you planned. Last winter I was supposed to be on a plane to my first trip by myself. I had been planning for 2 month. But unfortunately my plane was cancelled around the time that was scheduled to depart because of heavy snow. I could not help going back home. Worst of all when I arrived home my house had been robbed. Robbers took my new TV valuable jewelry money etc. All after I didn't start trip and spent the rest time trying to call the insurance company and go to the bank. Therefore I found that the situation I didn't plan I didn't expect I didn't prepare for always occur.
