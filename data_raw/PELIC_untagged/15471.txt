The house where I grew up is a small city in Taiwan. My family moved there I was ten. This house where my family does not live there anymore but I still remember every detail about it which was full of good memory to me. On the first floor the living room was in the front room where my family spent a lot of time together and chatted with during the evening. In the back were our kitchen and luxury dining room with its white marble floor and antique cupboard. The kitchen where was usually full of fragrance of foods was my mom's territory. Our bedrooms were upstairs. I had two sisters and we all had our own bedroom. However I like slept with my sisters who I got along well with. On the third floor was an entertain area. On the right hand side was a piano which belong to my order sister. Why I said that I don't like piano although I took piano lessons from a woman whose husband taught in our elementary school. Moreover in the middle of the area was a table tennis table which I often played with my neighbor. In short this house full of my childhood memory which I'll never forget.
