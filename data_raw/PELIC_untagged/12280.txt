Flow is the state of optimal experiences in which one devotes himself in activities simply for the sake of the activity itself. People whose activities are in a state of flow are using high levels of skill and challenge together to create an experience that is rich and personally beneficial. They can enjoy huge pleasure and creative feeling from this status as well. Naturally children can enter this sort of situation easier than adults. 'Flow' is loosely related to time in other words if a kid is in 'flow' status of a creative activity he forgets time which is passing by.
