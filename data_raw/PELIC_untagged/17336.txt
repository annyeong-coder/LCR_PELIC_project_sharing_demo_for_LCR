My apartment is bright and sunny. This cheers me up. And the living room is large I place in two big green plants it chills me down in the hot summer. I picked out a big couch to match with this big space. I hang up several pictures on the wall they decorate my apartment they also cover up some small spots. And I set up an aquarium in the corner I raise up some tropical fishes we leave the light on all the day for the fishes. We have a big audio system most time when we are at home my little son always turn it on then he dances he enjoys that but sometimes I feel it noisy. Meanwhile I feel lucky to have such big apartment so I could have a place to move around.
