The parent who try to become thoughtful is ideal for children. When the children tell their thoughts the ideal parent readily wants to listen to the thoughts even if the thoughts are very umimportant. In addition the ideal parent is someone who sometimes give children freedom and sometimes prohibit children from doing some bad behavior. What I want to say is that the ideal parent has to have the ability to decide which behavior is good or not. I want to become the father whom my children want to take after. When my children are dangerous I give them a hand and when they are happy I enjoy that happiness together.
