I was born in a small city in which the famous Chime were found. It was a very quiet and nice place that I wanted to live for ever. People living around the neighborhood were very friendly. In their leisure time they always went to the square which was near the neighborhood to learn dancing or singing. Life is beautiful for everyone who are trying to chase!
