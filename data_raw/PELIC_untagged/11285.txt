I'm going to talking about the man who my best friend. I have a lot of friends that studies at University of Pittsburgh. Especially one man who lives in Pittsburgh came to Pittsburgh for 8 months ago. His name is Min. I saw a man whose read a book in a class. I didn't know our relationship how it goes on. Anyway that was our first meeting. The friend who helps me. When I was mentally and physically exhausted with my hard homework he always gave some tips which he felt needed helping to me. And his help wich supports me
