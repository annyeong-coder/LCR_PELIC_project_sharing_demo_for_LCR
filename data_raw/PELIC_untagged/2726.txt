My room is cozy and comfortable. But somehow I don't feel good in my room recently. So I decided to move my stuff around. My host family wanted to help me out but I wanted to fix my room up myself. First of all I turned my CD player on. Because the music is help me up when I'm cleaning the room. And I checked my change list out. I cleaned up my ashtray and trash can straightened up my picture frames. My room is not small but the stuff makes my room smaller that I'm not using anymore. So I put that stuff back so that make up more spaces. After that I turned my desk around toward window. Because in spring I want to get more sunshine as much as I can. Changing my room is got through with hanging up my favorite movie poster. It cheers me up every time.
