Oct 7th 2011 Technology I couldn't live without There is a lot of technology in our life these days. New technology is making our life easier and some technology we couldn't live without because it's become very important in our day life also if we couldn't use technology like Computers cell phones iPods and a lot of technology it will affect our life and make it harder. Without this technology people will have a hard time doing works connecting with each other and studying. People have a different perspective about using technology some people rely on technology and count it as something initial and they cannot live without it. Other people have a different opinion they think technology is only a tool to get an easier life and they can live without it. In my opinion if I choose one technology I couldn't live without I will choose computer because I use computer every day and it is one of the most important in my life. I use computer for almost everything and doing a lot of work on my computer such as doing my homework talking with my family and chatting with friends reading newspapers and studying. Where the technology plays a key role in my life I spend approximately 5 hours every day on my computer so I can't imagine my life without computer it will be harder more complicated and keep me away from my friends and family.
