When I was high school student one time I had been an accident with my motorcycle. My motorcycle was crached. The good thing is that I didn't get any hurts but my wallet was gone. I kept check that area but I can't found it. Suddentlly a girl talked to me and gave me my wallet. My wallet was found by her. I check inside my wallet and nothing was being stolen. Finally I called my friend to pick me up so I got to my home by my friend's car.
