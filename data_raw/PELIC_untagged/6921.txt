When I came to U. S. I signed up in Pitt. In fact I took a test after that I ended up with myself in level 3. Then I held on to buy the books. After that I called my mother back to told her about my school. Then I picked up a new apartment. In fact I thought over before I picked it up because I finded it out far from my school. In addition I talk my friend into live with me in the apartment. Now I go with my friend on my apartment and I often wake up at 7 AM
