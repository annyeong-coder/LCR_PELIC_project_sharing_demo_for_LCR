Uzbek joke Uzbek people have series of jokes where usually Afandi an ordinary wise man and a rich man participate. These jokes not only make people laugh but also teach the reader or hearer to do goodness to all people. One day Afandi went to his neighbor who was a rich and greedy man to ask if he could borrow his big cauldron as he had invited some guests to his house. While giving Afandi his big cauldron the wealthy man asked him to take a good care of it. After couple days Afandi brought back the rich man's big cauldron along with a small little cauldron. When the rich man being surprised seeing two cauldrons asked Afandi where the second small one came from Afandi told him that his big cauldron gave a birth to a small one and so he brought them both to the owner. The rich man was happy and thanked Afandi for good care. Some days later Afandi came to the rich man and asked to borrow his big cauldron again. Obviously the rich man didn't say anything and let him borrow his big cauldron. Days passed but Afandi had not returned the cauldron so the rich man decided to visit Afandi and ask his cauldron back. When Adandi came out of his house the rich man ask whether everything was OK with his cauldron. Afandi with a terribly sad expression on his face told the rich man that his big cauldron had died. The rich man laughed and asked Afandi not to joke and bring out his cauldron he asked Afandi not to fool him and told him that it was impossible for a cauldron to die. The answer that Afandi gave to the rich man was that the cauldron which gives birth can certainly die too.
