Recently there has been a lot of news about committing suicide in Korea. Especially for last six months we could hear every month on the news that an actress committed suicide. This increase of suicide is not the problem only in Korea. According to the World Health Organization website in the last 45 years suicide rates have increased by 60 worldwide and suicide is now among the three leading causes of death among those aged 15 44 years. Why do people choose suicide Although there are many opinions about why people commit suicide there is no single comprehensive theory that explains all suicide. The major reasons of suicide can be categorized into sociological psychological and biological. First sociological reason is based on the idea that suicide results from extreme social changes around people. During the Great Depression the stock market crash took away people's future and caused dramatic suicides. According to Mishara Balan 2002 Suicide rates in the USA had been increasing each year steadily since 1925 and only a slightly greater increase in 1930 and 1931 may be attributed to the effects of the Great Depression. The erosion of traditional values is also one type of social changes. After the Industrial Revolution the sanctity and dignity of man has been fading away and people are often estimated by a workforce compared to a machine. A current economic structure makes not only some success stories but also many social failures and the failures sometimes make the extreme choice.
