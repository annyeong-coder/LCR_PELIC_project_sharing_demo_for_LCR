I met Dr. Jay who works at the Missouri University while I was studying in a graduate school. Last year my graduate institute held a international conference and invited Dr. Jay to speech about higher education at the conference. I was being a tourist guide when he was coming to Taiwan. I took him to visit several tourist attractions in Taipei city. One day while we were passing the Cram school St he was surprised and laughed because there was a cram school called Harvard ! Then I found that we had two things in common when he introduced his family and backgrounds . One is my boyfriend studied in CMU and his wife worked at CMU the other is I wanted to study English in University of Pittsburgh and he had graduated from PITT! I was glad to meet him and treasure our friendship.
