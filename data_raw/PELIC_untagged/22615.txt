I who am naturally optimistic have an easy going personality. I have a good temper which my co workers didn't think so . I like to help others who need to help for example old people or poor men. I am not a person who is always on time. I like chocolate which let me feel happy. Especially Godiva's chocolate popcorn which is my favorite is really delicious. I like travelling that I had a great day when I travelled in Europe for one month. Salzburg where The Song of Music which is my favorite movie took place is the best city. I want to be there again. I have many things that I want to do and have. Some people say that I am a sheltered person and too childish. I don't think so.
