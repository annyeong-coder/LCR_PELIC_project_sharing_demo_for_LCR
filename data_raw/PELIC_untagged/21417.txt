If I am going to be on a desert island for five weeks and can take three items with me I think I should take a knife lots of matches and a flashlight. First I don't know what kind of animals will I meet in this island so I can use a knife to protect my life from animals' attack. Besides I am able to use knife to help me cut something down such as woods or fruits so I can collect them easily. Second I can use matches to make fires and cook foods. Besides the temperature must be very cold in night and fire can make me feel warmer. The latest item that I ought to bring is flashlight because I can use it in night and light up the place that I pass by and it might keep me from falling on the way.
