When I go to Egypt I will visit the pyramids. If I study hard I will get the TOFEL score. Unless I buy a new toy my daughter will still crying. In case of having a new baby I need to buy a baby car seat. Because I like tourism I dream to travel around the word. After I finished my study at the ELI I will start my master degree. As soon as I made my master degree I will back to my country. Once I got million I will buy a new house. Before I return to my country I will visit Las Vegas. Although I hate the cold weather I will go to a trip with my friend next week to Alaska.
