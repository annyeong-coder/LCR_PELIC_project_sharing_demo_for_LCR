When I was child I used to visit my grandfather and grandmother everyday. My grandfather whose age was 80 years old lived in a small house which was made of mud. On the other hand my grandmother was 65 years old and she lived in a big house which was alittle bit far from our house and it took half an hour to get there. I was eager to visit my grandmother because I had many friends and most of whom lived close to my grandmother's house. When my mother died her house was sold and then I never went there and since ever then I did not see my friends.
