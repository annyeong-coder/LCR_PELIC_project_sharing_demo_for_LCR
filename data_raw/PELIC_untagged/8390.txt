There is an old maxim that don't count your chickens before they hatch but I disagree. When I was a child I always was told that don't bother other people and you should act with prudence by my father so I tried to be discreet in my behavior. However an act in prudence wasn't always a good thing for me despite a lot of merit. First of all sometimes I was so prudent that I speculate only negative results I used to miss opportunities. 10 Yeas ago when I was working part time job for interludes for getting back to my university after being released from the army. At that time online clubs prevailed among university undergraduates in Korea. I joined a club is named Myodong which means association of people who birth in 1975 as Year Of The Rabbit the rabbit is one of the 12 oriental zodiac animals and I used to read funny or serious own stories that members write. Then I presented a regular meetings in a pub and there I met a woman that fell in love at first sight. She was looking very dashing in a white two piece and she looked strikingly gorgeous. Later I found that the woman who I have talked with before at online and we continued to have a online chatting. However I wasn't supposed to be with her despite her words that I was similar with her first love. I thought that she had to meet someone better than me because she was too perfect in every way and I tried not to see her. Then I didn't go to the club anymore and I have to let her go but I regret to have done such a thing then. To summarize it is dangerous to do nothing but what is more dangerous is to dream nothing. Nothing happens unless first a dream.
