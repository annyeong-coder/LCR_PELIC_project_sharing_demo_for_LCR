My Apartment When I first came to Pittsburgh I was looking for a good apartment that is located in a safe and quite neighborhood. I found a nice and furnished apartment but I couldn't move in to it immediately. I was told that it needs to be cleaned and fixed and that will take about two weeks. That was a big problem because I didn't have a place to stay in. I was staying at an expensive hotel. I had already spent a lot of money and I didn't want to spend more. To work out this problem I searched the internet for cheap hotels. I found out that there are websites that help to get great deals with hotels. I found a cheap hotel and stayed into it. After two weeks I was finally able to move in to my new apartment. I like my apartment. It is very bright and spacious. It has also a view on the garden and the swimming pool. What I don't like about my apartment is the furniture. I found out that it is used and old. I didn't know what to do so I called in a friend of mine. She came to see my apartment and she talk in to me to buy furniture from IKEA. She told me that the furniture in IKEA has caught on because of its design and color. Tomorrow I'm going to IKEA with her and if I liked the furniture I will come back again with my brother to pick it up. I really like my apartment and I don't think that it needs any further changes. The most important thing to me that it is clean and located in a very safe and quite place.
