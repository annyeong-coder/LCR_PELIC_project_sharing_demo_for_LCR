One of the things that I have been successful at is trimming my dog's fur perfectly. I used to bring my dog to a pet salon to take a bath and trim her fur. One day I felt that maybe I could do it by myself and I thought it was good for improving the relationship of my dog and I and also good for saving money. The problem was that I never did it before so it was a difficult task to start it. I remembered that the first time I finished trimming my dog and my mother said What did you do for the dog She looked terrible when she saw it. Then she asked me to bring my dog to a pet salon and cut her all fur. I didn't give up and tried to do something to improve my skill. One of the things that contributed to my success was that I read a lot of books and magazines that introduce how to trim your pets' fur by yourself. For example you should buy a suitable scissors and comb that is you have to prepare correct tools. The second thing that contributed to my success was I went to a pet salon and observed how the pets stylists did. There I saw them how to use the tools and imitate their skills. The final thing that contributed to my success was I practiced many times. In order to get more chance to practice I went to a stray dog center and volunteered to help washing and trimming dogs. I've done this job for several months. Now I can trim my dog's fur beautifully.
