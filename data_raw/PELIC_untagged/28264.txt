I was born and grew up in Taipei where is the capital city of Taiwan. In my hometown where attracts many tourists to visit every year there are a lot of department stores in where you can go shopping and the convenient transportation system which can take you to anywhere that you want to go. There are also many night markets where I have gone with my friends with whom I'm familiar to eat food that is Taiwanese traditional diet and shop many times. I have been missing my family who are living in Taiwan and my friends whom I met while we were studying in college since I came to Pittsburgh.
