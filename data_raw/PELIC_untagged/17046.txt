Welcome to my page! I have been living in Pittsburgh for two years since 2007. I like travelling various places by driving a car in the US. I have visited many places already. I have been building this site to introduce my travel journal. I've finished my travel journal of ten days in Florida in this site. I haven't included the pictures yet but I will do. I wish many people enjoy my site. First five days of my trip in Florida I went to Disney World which has four big theme parks. I visited all of them and I stayed at one of Disney World Resort Hotel. As a benefit of staying there I could enjoy the theme parks until late night. It was Christmas season when I travelled in Florida so decorations in the parks were brilliant. I really experienced a plenty of spectacles and attractions. My best favorites were Safari in Animal Kingdom and Fantasmic! In Hollywood Studios. Above all the special fireworks for Christmas celebration sympathized with Christmas music has been staying in my heart as a precious memory. Anyway I really enjoyed all of them as if I came back to childhood. Actually I have visited there twice so far but I still want to come back again. I haven't captured the world yet. The rest days I visited Everglades National park Bahia Honda State parks and Key West. In Everglades National Park I found many crocodiles on hiking trail road. They are so big but very lazy. Since I heard that they had never attacked people I could walk just by crocodiles and my husband took my picture with them. In Bahia Honda State park I found an iguana walking in the parking lots. I enjoyed observing a lot of wild plants and animals in both parks. That was very interesting experience I've ever had. In the middle of long travel I got tired of walking around. I needed more strength that's why I have been excising for a while. When I came back Pittsburgh I caught a terrible cold. Except that part it was great trip for me.
