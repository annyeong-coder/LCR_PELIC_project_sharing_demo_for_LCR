The auther said that because there are some teachers at schools do not let the childrens creat something from their mind such as in the paint class they give them a guidelines they have to stick with it even if they do not like it. Based on my educational experiences I had alot of problems such as I mention before at the paint class I try to drow somthing I like and when I hand it in to the teacher he mark it with a zero !! And the reason why I did not do what I have told from the initial of the class I tried to drow something like a beach with the ocean and he want me to dorw a yellow and red flowers !! That is why most of the people did not became creativ.
