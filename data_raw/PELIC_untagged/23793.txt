My food experiences in America have been quite . I like the variety of food and the fact that it is always available. I especially like Mexican food. I although like American junk food but I do not eat it a lot because it is unhealthy. I think it is true that Americans cannot cook because many adults in the United States today simply do not know cooking basics that is what Chef ANON_NAME_0 Zifchak who is a teacher of cooking at the Culinary Institute of America said and his students follow his directions with uneven results. They make a lot of mistakes and often ask questions that even beginning cooks know the answers. I think although Americans have a busy lifestyle so they don't have much time to cook and as families began eating together less often many people grew up never learning the basics in the kitchen. I do not know any Americans who can cook.
