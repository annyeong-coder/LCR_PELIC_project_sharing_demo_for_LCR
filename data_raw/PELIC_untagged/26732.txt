My first experience of foreign country I used to live in Japan. I attended Rikkyo University in Tokyo as exchange student. I used to study Japanese and Japanese literature. It was difficult for me to understand their literature exactly because I did not have much background knowledge about Japanese Culture. However I got use to understanding their culture. It was really good experience for me. Now I am living in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh life is more difficult than Tokyo life because Western Culture is totally different from Eastern Culture. I feel Cultural Shock everyday. However I am really satisfied with Pittsburgh life. I think Pittsburgh life is never forgettable experience for me.
