First I have to make a definition of the traditional lifestyle . It means that people are always the group and need to communicate or cooperate with others. According to this definition the nontraditional lifestyle means that someone is ISOLATED from others. I can't live in this condition! I am a person who needs to PARTICIPATE in some groups and connect with others in my LEISURE time. I will feel UNEASY if I SET myself APART FROM the society. Therefore I will always REJECT the nontraditional lifestyle until I die.
