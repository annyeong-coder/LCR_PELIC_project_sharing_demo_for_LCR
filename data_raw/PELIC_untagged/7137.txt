A fad that interests me The most interesting fad for me was the scooter . When I was a little boy I were love skating . When the first time I heard about the scooter was by word of mowth . And my friends told me that you have to buy one . At that time it became very populer and it catches on . It was sold like hotcake and it made a mint for there owners . Also in my opinion its very practical fad its very useful it can takes you from place to another faster by walking . When you buy the scooter it will come with it a peice of paper with some tips on it to explaine how you can use the scooter or to help you how to use it .
