The differences between rural and urban life. When I think about the differences between rural and urban life I go back to my life's experiences. I was born in a rural Brazilian town and later lived in the biggest city of South America Sao Paulo for ten years. One of the most striking differences is the pace of life. When I was living with my parents in a neighboring rural town I could wake up about thirty minutes before school started I could have a tasty breakfast cooked by my mom and then I could walk to school and arrive on time with a big smile on my face. On the contrary the start of my morning in Sao Paulo was a nightmare just the opposite of my childhood experience mostly due to the time that I had to spend in traffic. Sao Paulo's traffic jams last twenty four hours a day and seven days a week. I had to wake up two hours in advance eat a horrible breakfast while driving the car and spend more than one hour in traffic. I confess that my mood was not the best when I arrived at work.
