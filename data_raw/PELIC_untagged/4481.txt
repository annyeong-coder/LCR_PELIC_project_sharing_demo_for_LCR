First of all I used to not clean my room for a long time. For example my mother is so neat person so my house's kitchen living room and bathroom are so clean. But whenever I went to my bedroom looks garbage. At that time it didn't matter to me. I thought that it is natural. Recently I'm changing. I'm living with my American person. He is very clean person such as my mother. First his house is all white color. When I opened door I can see living room. Because of white carpet I have to clean my shoes. And then to the left I can see kitchen. Ah the center of kitchen doesn't put anything. Just I can see a fresh flowers. Ans a little further I can see bathroom it's also clean such as hotel bathroom. And go to upstairs I can see my bedroom. When I came first time the bedroom was messy and dirty which my bedroom in Korea. But whenever I came back home my roommate cleaned my bedroom. Sine then I had to clean my bedroom. Because I didn't want him to excuse my fault. Because of my bedrooms environment. Now I can think more constructive and arrangement thinking. When I was living in Korea I couldn't. I'm appreciate to my environment. I didn't know how clearly thinking could help to myself if I clean my house.
