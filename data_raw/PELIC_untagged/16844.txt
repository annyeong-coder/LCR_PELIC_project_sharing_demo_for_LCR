I met my friend ANON_NAME_0 while we were at high school. The first time I met him he was waiting for his father at the end of school day. His father gave me a ride home and I asked him to let ANON_NAME_0 stay with me that evening. Since that we have become close friends then we entered college together. We were working a part time in the evening at small company while we were at college. When were students we went to many trips together and we always had enjoyable time.
