Also if the students don't get a good grade in the class that will make stress on them because they can't be able to obtain a good grade. The second of the pressure is the money the financial issue is the one of the problems that makes presser on the being student the student spend most of time on the class or on the homework so they can't be able to find a time to work and they must to pay a tuition and books furthermore they need to eat and wear that makes them borrow the money from their friends or their parents. The third problem is finding a place to live the students want to live near from the college but they sometimes can't get dormitory or apartment or the rent of apartment is very expensive that makes them to live in places farther from the college and they will make them looking for transportation that means other issue . For all those reasones being a student has its negative sides too. It is difficult to get a high degree in the education system.
