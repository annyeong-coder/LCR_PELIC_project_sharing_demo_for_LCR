My boss is Takeo Kanade. He has been a professor of Carnegie Mellon University since 1980 where he has been the director of the Robotics Institute for 10 years. He has worked in multiple areas such as robotics computer vision artificial intelligence and so on. The most famous product is a virtualized reality application CBS's Eye Vision. This system was demonstrated during SuperBowl 2001. In this system he used more than 30 cameras. However he has planned to develop more than 100 cameras for the application since then. He was already more than 60 years old but the researchers who are belonged to his lab. Still have worked with him for almost 30 years because the technology and his motivation has not turned off yet. Moreover he is one of the world's foremost researchers in computer vision.
