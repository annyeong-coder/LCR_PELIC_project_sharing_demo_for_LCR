What was surprised me is that my college decided to send me overseas to study. When I was studying at my college in Saudi Arabia I have received a message from my college that they told me you were chosen to study overseas. I decided to go to the United States and I started applied for a visa. Weather the United States embassy will approve my visa or not was nervous me. Then the question was if the embassy rejected my request. I told myself that if they rejected my request I will go to Canada. After all they accepted my request. I started packing to be ready for the trip. That I was happy is obvious. The fact that I was shocked when I came to the United States was the weather. The weather is totally different from Saudi Arabia.
