I met my best friend ANON_NAME_0 while I was living in Peru. I met her the first day of classes we were doing our practice of Chemistry on the same lab. She didn't have all her instruments so she asked me if I had all my instruments and if I can shared with her. At that moment we started being friends and we started having classes together we graduated together and we are the best friends ever even when we are away of each other.
