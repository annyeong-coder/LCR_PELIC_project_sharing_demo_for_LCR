Dear future students I am happy to write this letter to you. I strongly believe the writing 4 class will help you to increase your writing skill. Let me explain about the writing 4 class to you. You will have a lot of opportunities to write a paragraph which means part of a piece of writing which starts on a new line and contains at least one. Also you will study about topic sentence and thesis sentence. Then you will learn about how to write an essay. There are several kinds of essays which you will learn such as 'cause and effect' 'problem and solution' and 'compare and contraction'. In writing an essay I think making organization is the most important thing. Finally the teacher's feedback will help you a lot. If you write an essay you will get a teacher's feedback which indicates your strength and weakness and mistakes. I hope you will get a great improvement in writing. Regards ANON_NAME_0.
