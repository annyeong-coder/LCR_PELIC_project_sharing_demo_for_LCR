I agree that every one likes traveling and discovers new country or city. But the importing thing is how to get your airplane ticket with cheaper price. First try to decide your trip before one or two months and choose the exact day and how long you are going to spend. Second go to the internet look forward and have idea about price in different web cite and some times you can find offers but they choose the date of the depart and return. Third contact some airlines company and see if they have good deal with interesting price and may be you can negotiate. Finally after having all there ideas from different places you can buy your ticket. In conclusion I hope that my method is interesting and good trip for every one.
