Dear Mr. ANON_NAME_0 I am a student in your school. I am writing to tell something about the computer training institute. First of all it should have more employees. It had better have anew computers printers and system. Furthermore you ought to change the carpet and get anew and bigger baskets. In addition the windows are broken you should not leave them like that. As well as the employee drinks coffee next to the computer you should not accept that. Moreover he comes too late and I think you had better to give him warning. The time is very important and it does not have clocks you should put some clocks in the lap. Instead I want to ask can you see with out lights in the dark You had better fix them that we can see. For the student who has appointment with the technical he is waiting for long time standing you should have chairs there. Finally there is no protection for the lap the door is always open. Mr. ANON_NAME_0 I am sorry for no convenience but I wrote this letter because I care about the school. Your son ANON_NAME_1
