Yolanda's mother has acknowledged Yolanda's inherent ability since she saw Yolanda who was being surrounded by crowd and reading poetry. The mother showed up every Yolanda's recital sitting front row center to encourage her. Unfortunately Yolanda had an uneasiness feeling and then her creativity was decline. At first when Yolanda graduated her university she wanted to be poet but she amended her question form writer teacher. She knows she hasn't written poetry in years and she can't come up with ideas. Her mother is pure person she can't believe that Yolanda doesn't have ability any more. From my opinion Yolanda still gives recite but this is for her mother. If she succeeds as a writer she wouldn't be a collage instructor. There are 2 incidents to hide Yolanda's ability of poet. I ascribe hiding Yolanda's ability to her mother's surveillance. Yolanda's divorce affects her imagination.
