No I would not. I prefer to live a traditional lifestyle. Even living a traditional lifestyle ISOLATES people away from PARTICIPATING in community activities but I think they able to live a CAREFREE and a quiet life nothing can DISTURB them. Because every thing there is normal and natural. For example some people in my country live far away from cities so they do not have a problem with traffic as people who live in the big cities. I know that most people REJECT to live a traditional lifestyle and some like to do that. However every one has to choose the appropriate lifestyle for him and his family.
