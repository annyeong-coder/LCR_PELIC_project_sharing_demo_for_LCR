I have one experience that one woman liked me. I remember that her face was not good so I rejected her propose that she wanted to become couple with me. After 6 years I became a university student. My school is located in Seoul so I lived by myself. One day I went to father's house which is located in Iksan that is small city. While I was living his house I saw my ideal type that she was so beautiful so I wanted eye connect with her. When she saw me she has already known me. At that time I was surprised that she was an ugly woman that she liked me 6years ago. I wondered why she became a beautiful woman so I asked her why you are beautiful. She said that she underwent a plastic operation. After that happen I realized that I should know to distinguish that woman's face is real or fake so I could not believe woman's face until now.
