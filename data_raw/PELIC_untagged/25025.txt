In my opinion the ideal parents should respect their children's desires. Conversation is one of good way to be good parents. Especially children who are at puberty tend to be reluctant to talk with their parents. In this case parents should be careful to treat them who may be sensitive or acute. After trying to do small talk with children every day sharing deeper feeling of them would be easier. Also showing affection to their children is one of the most important things which good parents should do. Interest to trivial things which is easily to be ignored and encouragement will be helpful. It makes children to feel a sense of stability that they are under the care of their parents.
