In my opinion I think that online dating is not a good way to meet someone. First there are some people who write wrong information in there profiles gust to impress. Also dating someone for the first time without seeing her it's embarrassing because if you didn't like her it well be hard to tell her. The most important thing it is dangerous to date a stranger. Because of the incredibility the embarrasses and the dangerousness. I think online dating is not a good idea.
