My Future plans. I want to do a lot of things. First I am going to finish my ELI class. After that I will back to Mexico. In Mexico I might look for a god job. Also I may put my own business. I don't know exactly what kind of business but I have some ideas. After that I might to be able to learn Portuguese. Another thing is I could go to Ecuador and Colombia for visit my friends. I have many plants and I hope that I could do everything. Finally I will be with my family. These are some of thing that I could do.
