Unemployment effects of Mongolia after the Soviet Era Mongolia is a country those five times as small as USA with population 2. 5 Million. Before 1990 in the Soviet Era 1921 1990 people didn't have right to own livestock immovable and industrial property and they were herding state livestock and working in a state industry. In 1990 Mongolia transformed toward to political pluralism and to a market economy system. Many state industries and organizations were closed down by economical and political reasons so people were lay off directly from their job. This unemployment has had three main effects poverty a high crime rate and street children. First effect was poverty. During communism people didn't have any property so they became a poor after lost their job. Also they didn't know about a market economy system didn't have an abilities to earn money in a free market economy. For example one member of Great Public Meeting it was highest organization that produce a law like a parliament but it was not real parliament it was a one of the communist organization had lay off and he didn't have any experience and he became a homeless. Another effect of unemployment was a rise in the crime rates. People didn't believe their future and some of them were suicide themselves. Alcoholism prostitution social anarchism was spread at the all social level. All this arguments caused a high rate of crime. At last the most harmful effect was a street child. Many unemployment parents couldn't take a care their family some of them particularly men used to alcoholism and made depress to their children. So children escaped from a home live in a street without any parents' depress. In the conclusion poverty a high crime rate and street children are harmful in social life and economy development. Thus government organizations determined a policy that decrease unemployment rate and implemented it and now unemployment of Mongolia is lowing down and economic situation is stabilizing and rising.
