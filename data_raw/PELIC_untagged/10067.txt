The most interesting experience I've ever had with money was four years a go when I came first time in US. I arrived to New York airport first time from Turkey. After that I went to baggage line for take my baggages. I had many suitcase and I needed a baggage car. At this time I remembered terrible think when I saw the baggage cars I didn't have any money for taking a car. I was afraid and sad. The cars was very cheep but. . . Before the traveling I was ask my husband about money and he said you don't need any money in the airport. When I was thinking my situation a Turkish lady said hi and she asked me do you need help . Almost I had to cry because I was shy. After that I explained my situation. She started smile to me and she gave me lent money for a baggage car.
