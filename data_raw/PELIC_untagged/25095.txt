I will pick enough fresh water an ax several matches some fishing equipment and maps of area. I picked enough fresh water because nobody can be alive more than a week without fresh water. The reason that I chose some fishing equipment and several matches was becuase I can catch some fish and cook it using fire that has been lighted by matches. Also it might be cold and I can use matches to light a fire to get warm. I chose an ax as I can use it to cut down the trees and make wooden boat which I conuse to go back to my house. Also maps of the area are very important becuase you I can use it to know where you are in a specific time. I hope it never happens.
