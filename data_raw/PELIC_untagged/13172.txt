Cathy Maready didn't file a flight which it decided on November 1981. Here plane stopped three miles from the shore. But nobody knew about here. The water was frigid. She started swimming using stars toward shore in the dangerous sea. With strong determination Maready eventually reached shore a grueling seven and half hours after the crash. She was found staggering along the beach suffering from shock and severe hypothermia. She went to the hospital. Later a healthy and lucky Maready was released from the hospital.
