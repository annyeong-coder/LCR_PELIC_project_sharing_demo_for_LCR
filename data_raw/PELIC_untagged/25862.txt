She said that her favorite way of wasting time is to watch movies. Also she added that the last movie she had seen was 'Prince of Persia'. She complained that it had not been as good as she had expected. She told me that her plans for the following vacation were trip to California. She explained that she had wanted to go there for a long time. Also she reported that the weather of California is usually wonderful. Additionally she admitted that her biggest pet peeve was winter and snow. When I asked the reason she reminded me that she was from the country that doesn't have winter. Finally she pointed out that she used to ride a bike when she was younger but she didn't' do it anymore. She commented that she became timid as she grew up.
