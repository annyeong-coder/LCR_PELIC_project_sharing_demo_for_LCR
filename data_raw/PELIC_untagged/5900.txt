I lived in a small Island until 18years old. When I was 6years old I learned to play the piano. So after 2years I could play the piano well. Add I could read a sheet of music. But when I was 11years old the piano institute was closed. I couldn't learded about piano anymore. Nobody was in my village to teach me about piano. After I didn't learn piano I wan't able to play the piano. Because I didn't practice to play the piano by myself. So now I can't play the piano.
