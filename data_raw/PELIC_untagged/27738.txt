My apartment is beautiful. I usually straighten it up. It's very clean because I always throw all the garbage away. I put up some pictures on the walls. Last week it was dark but I lighten it up by changing the lamps. I used to leave the light on when I leave the house but I'll try to remember turning it off when I don't need. My friends like my apartment and that cheered me up. I like also to turn on some music. I don't like to put off my apartment's needs. Sometimes I try out all the electrical devices. If I find out any damage I immediately fix it.
