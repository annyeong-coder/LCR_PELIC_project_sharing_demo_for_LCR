My favorite room in my house is my bedroom. When you open the door of my bedroom you can meet an aisle. On the right of the aisle there is a bathroom. If you go straight a little more there is a closet to contain our clothes on the right side of the aisle. If you turn left you can see a long window on the back wall. Under the window there is my bed. On the right side of my bed there is my niece's bed. There is my desk in front of my bed. My niece's bed is in front of her bed. There are my notebook computer my books and a desk lamp on top of my desk. There is a desk lamp on top of my niece's desk. There is a floor stand next to my niece's desk. I like my bedroom most because it's convenient for me.
