Writing4M 2 6 07 I have a successful friend that he opens his own on line clothes store. My friend is 24 years old just older than me about 2 years. He likes to do everything new. One time he bought some clothes on E Bay and compared the price between Taiwan and Japan. Then he found the clothes in Japan are cheaper than Taiwan so he had a new idea. He wanted to open a store on E Bay. He was very lucky because he has a cousin in Japan so he went to Japan to find some brand of clothes that most Taiwan teenagers like. Finally he found a stores very quickly so he bought some clothes and put them on E Bay to start his own store. He was very happy because the store became popular a lot of people bought his clothes on his store. So he bought more things and put them on E Bay. Now he can make a lot of money by himself. I think he is very successful because he opens a store and lot of people like it.
