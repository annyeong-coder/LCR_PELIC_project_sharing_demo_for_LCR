In my opinion the sustainability and personal and social responsibility are two more important values than the others. Because the former is the ultimate goal of the Green Movement and the latter is the core motivation to achieve it. Only if holding the core value of being responsible people will attempt to use the resources in wiser way avoid to violate the environment and fulfill the rest of values. After the first nine values be done the ultimate goal will be accomplished. That is why I think the sustainability and personal and social responsibility are essential of Green Movement.
