The authors of The Creative Spirit believe that creativity curiosity and the desire of exploring new things are the features of every child. When children first attend the school they are given the opportunity to explore their surroundings without being constantly interrupted and without being in a rush to do things. Stage after a stage adults feel that it is crucial for children to learn new and important skills and to value the importance of time which is absolutely a good thing if adults recognize the right way to do it. Unfortunately many adults don't. They love their children and they want them to be the best of the best yet sometimes they go to the extremes when they teach them. Children are being pushed to be perfect. They are being pushed to perform new activities and to learn new skills based on the adults high standards. Many times adults don't take in consideration the child's preferences and proclivities. As a result children loose the excitement and the urge to explore. They no longer enjoy learning the way they used to. I completely agree with the authors' opinions especially when they refer to evaluation and pressure as the creativity killers. In fact I experienced the negative impacts of those elements when I was a child. For me I felt that school was a place where survival of the fittest is the primary law. Ver draw. I strongly believe that parents and school can help the child to excel in life if they recognize his tendencies and interests. They should support him instead of pushing him. Children were born creative and all they need is to be encouraged and supported to learn.
