I met my best friend at classroom in high school. It was our first day of high school. When I saw him first time he was taking a seat next to my desk. As being tall and big He looked like having a good motor nerves. I thougt that he might play soccer. I was thinking of joining soccer club at that time. I asked him whether he plays soccer or not. He answered yes . So I said him Why don't we go to the ground to look around soccer club after classes . Then we joined soccer club and became best friends.
