My bath room in the Korea house is cozy and bright. I lived there for 10 years I have a lot of memories. Sometimes I invited my friend over for drinking when my parents left for vacation. I also cried in my room when I was high school student because I let my parents down. There are many memories and I cannot write down all but these things make my room more special and make me laugh. I put a drawing on the wall which I drew when I was child. Wall paper is special. My family moved this house when I was an elementary school student. I picked out wall paper and there are three kinds of wall paper which are white with heart shape Micky and Mini paper and sky blue Disney wall paper. Sky blue wall paper has nightglow star so it glows when I turn off the light at night. Sometimes my friends make fun of me because of the childish wallpaper but I like it. My room used to have a balcony but I tore door down and I set bookshelf up there. Now my bed on the right of room but I usually turn my bed around near the window in summer. That arrangement let much wind in so it's really cool even if I don't turn on an air conditioner.
