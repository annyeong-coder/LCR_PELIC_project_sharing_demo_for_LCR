When I came back from university last week I found a message from my friend in my cell phone . My friend wants to figure out the preparation of the TOEFL and talk TOEFL over to ANON_NAME_0 and how to prepare for it . ANON_NAME_0 gave him form to join to the TOEFL course but he was hesitated . He told me about everything in the message. I met him and asked him to sit down and we talk the TOEFL over and found solution . I talked my friend into joining in the TOEFL course and sign up . Last Friday my friend filled the application out and started the course . I am so happy for him and I always advise him to keep on studying . I will write story down to be as memorize in U. S. A .
