I don't like the movie which features the aliens or the magic because it is based on the fiction. It isn't related to real world only give us light interest. Instead of these movies I love to see the movie whose background is historical fact. I think 'The Gladiator' starring Russell crowe is the best movie I've ever seen before. The exellence of this movie was already proved by being nominated for some awards in a variety of film contests. In short 'The Gladiator' is a drama of revenge which is used as a topic of numerous movies however the spectators are absorbed in not a plot but the charming pictures and a perfect reproduction of the Rome empire. In addition the spectators can feel as they are going through the tragic incident by assimilating to the emotion of Maximus. In concusion I recommend you see the movie in person which makes your blood run cold.
