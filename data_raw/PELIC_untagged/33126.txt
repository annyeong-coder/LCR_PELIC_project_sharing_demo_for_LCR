I have studied in ELI since last winter. I've signed up for 3 classes writing grammar and reading lessons for this semester. I've finished to write an essay in the writing class. It was not easy to do because the length of an essay was much longer than I wrote in level 4 class. I haven't done yet learning grammar. I've studied it since I was a middle school student. However I've forgotten lots of rules of English grammar over and over. Also in my case I've learned how to understand other countries' culture and tradition in ELI. By my self assessment I've done it well. I've practiced English speaking since I arrived this country. But I still feel nervous and uncomfortable while having conversations in English. I haven't completed well making English habit. I need making more efforts to overcome this uneasiness.
