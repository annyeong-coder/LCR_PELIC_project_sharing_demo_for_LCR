First of all when I was in Korea I had never played soccer on every Sunday morning. I had almost been tiring everyday because a lot of nigh duty were the cause of my tiring. But since I moved to Pittsburgh I have been playing soccer in a nice park on every Sunday morning. Secondly before I came to the U. S. I have never made foreign friend. In Korea I had not taken an opportunity to speak with foreigner because I was too shy to speak different country people. ELI gives a good chance to me make different country friend. Third when I was moved to here I had never learned an organization English education system because I graduated a commercial high school where taught a different field to student. But since I entered to ELI I have been learning an organization English education system.
