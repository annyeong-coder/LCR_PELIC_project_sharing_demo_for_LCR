Dear Mr. ANON_NAME_0 I am a student of the EFL Computer Training Institute. My classes are very good but the Institute had better make some improvements or many students are going to leave. First I think you should make rules that no drinks or foods are allowed in classrooms. Second I think you'd better require the students to empty the trash. Third I think you ought to repair the electronics. In addition you'd better not allow students to use the public computer for too long a time. After that you should provide enough computers to us because sometimes we can't finish the on line homework at school. Finally you shouldn't let the current conditions as they are. Thank you for your attention.
