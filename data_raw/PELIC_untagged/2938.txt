Life pasts too fast and we have to live it in the best way we can without ever forgetting the important things. In life we have many important things such as love family and faith. Love the most beautiful feeling that we can have for ourselves and others. With it we show our feelings and emotions and learn to enjoy life. Family is what holds me together and makes me feel safe and protected. It is a port in a storm where I can find security and always rely on it. Faith is what keeps me strong during the difficult moments that I face. These are the most important things that I have in life. Without these things I can not be happy in life.
