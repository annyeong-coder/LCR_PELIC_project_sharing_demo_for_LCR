Old English proverb said A friend in need is a friend indeed . I agree with this sentence. I think that a real friend is someone who can help you out when you are in trouble. I don't have many friends but I have a good real friend whose name is Song I which means mushroom. So her nickname is Mushroom Princess. She is a small and very cute girl like a little mushroom. I met her when I was a college student in 1997. We had a same hobby which is going to classical concerts. We studied together and helped each other when someone in trouble. In 2003 Song I and I went to Germany and Italy respectively for our study. I got homesick desperately because it was my first time in foreign country alone. Song I heard this and she came from Germany to Italy to take care of me. It took almost 12 hrs by train. I could get well by her kind care and she returned to Germany again. After her return I heard surprising news from other friends. They said Song I gave up her final exam. I was so sorry to hear that. Even though she is not famous musician now I believe she will be a good musician. We cannot meet each other often but she is a part of my life. I am so happy to have such a great friend like Song I.
