The best way to solve the problem is to borrow money from the bank. For instance if you have enough money you can have the advertising that everyone will know your restaurant. You can also hire a professional cook and he can cook better than previous students. After you hire the cook you can modify your menu. Try to add some special meals to appeal the customers. For this reasons I think the best solution is to ask the bank lend you money.
