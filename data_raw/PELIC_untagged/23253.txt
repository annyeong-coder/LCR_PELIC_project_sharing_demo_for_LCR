What would be your reaction if someone stole your own work after you tried hard to do it These days many people are sharing copyrighted materials and downloading files illegally. Especially since the internet has spread all over the world. In my perspective it is not fair to share copyrighted materials because it will lose the owner his money disrespect the owner and makes the products more expensive.
