Putting my first draft on the computer can save my considerable time when revising. It doesn't only help save time but also remind the idea what was it. So I can organize stronger than before. I usually use the method that I did revise with first draft. When I saw first draft I could add more detail and example. For example when I didn't support it well I can add after it easily. However If I don't put my first draft I don't know exactly what did I write. That's why I support the opinion.
