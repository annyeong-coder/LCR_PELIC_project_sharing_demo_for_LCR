In Pittsburgh I feel colder than in my country. I always stay up late here because I feel homesick so much . I go out with my friends on weekends but I have so few friends in this city. I didn't worry about my living conditions and money in my country but I am worried about everything here. I need so much time to adapt to my new life. And I speak more English than my country and I meet more International students than in my country.
