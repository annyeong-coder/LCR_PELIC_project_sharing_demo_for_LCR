I will never forget the day I had while hanging out with my cousins. Never could I laugh as much as I did that day. It had been a funny and an unforgettable experience. Planing to have fun that day me and my cousins decided to go to a local recreation center in our neighborhood. In that place there was a local cinema a library and a dining hall. Arriving to the recreation center we went to eat lunch. After that we decided to walk outside. Walking in the nice weather we passed by the cinema and took a look at the shows for the night. While looking at the posters the cinema man asked us to go inside for free because there is a trial movie that was displayed at the time. Walking from the sunny outdoors to the dark indoors cinema we entered the show as blind people. The fact that it was so dark that I couldn't even see my hands made me touch every thing around me to find my way. Trying to find a chair I suddenly saw one of my cousins on the stage in front of the show shouting to us to come to the front and pointing that there is no one other than us. Hearing some laughs around me made me search for a place to set quietly. Never did I thought that there are a few people watching the movie and seeing us clearly. After a while I could see the place more clearly and I figured out that most of the people sitting inside were watching us acting crazy because we couldn't see from the effect of the sun. When I remember what my cousin did standing in front of the show I laugh a lot.
