2. I lived with my parents and my siblings whom you have met. 5. My brother whom I hardly ever saw slept on the living room couch. 6. It was a large old couch which my father had made himself. 7. My best friend whose family I loved lived across the hall. 11. They sold delicious bread and cake which people stood in line for hours to buy. 12. My brother and sisters whom I miss live far away now.
