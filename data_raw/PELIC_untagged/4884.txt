I would like to pick past. I have three reasons. First of all I want to study more hard. When I was highschool student I didn't study all of class well and I didn't want to read a book. I liked to play computer game and soccer. I regret that I didn't study all of class. If I come to past I study hard all subjects. Second I exercise hard. I liked to play soccer and so on. But I didn't exercise well after entrancing University. I drunk too much and ate much food. If I come to past I whould exercise hard. Finally I want to change my dream. I liked to play soccer. So I started to play soccer in middle soccer student. Now I play soccer once a week. I love to play soocer. I sometimes think if I become soccer player I would be good player. If I come to past I would start to play soccer from 8 years old. I may practice very hard and then I may become very popular soccer player. Whatever I want to go back to past but I think past is not important how should I do is more important in the future.
