In my opinion practicing a sport is a crucial part of our life. Why Obviously we can come across different health problems in which the solution is hidden in practicing sport regularly. These health problems are not just physical besides that mental problems might occur. These occurrences are generally due to conservation of some harmful substances in our body. We have to get rid of them to regulate our body function otherwise our body can't play its role flawlessly. These cleaning up process start with replacing unclean oxygen with clean one while we are practicing. This has vital significance to feed our blood with clean oxygen in order to obtain appropriate reactions in our body cells. This situation is adequate to have healthy body in which the organs cooperate accurately. After this situation bad things inside us will spontaneously go out and then we will have healthy body which acts better in physically and mentally.
