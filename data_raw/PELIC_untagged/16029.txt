Alex and Manny will be going to the desert Island and this is the conversation between them. Alex Manny two weeks is a long time and I know that there is no water in a desert island. We must take water that is enough for two weeks. We will have to determine how much water would be enough at the first place. Manny You are right Alex. We have to take water. We ought to take some food also since there is no market place in a desert island. Alex We should also take camping gear. It would be good have a knife with us all the time. Manny Why Alex To put up a tent to sleep. Manny I think we have to take a flash light more then camping gear for the dark. What are we going to do at night if we do not see anything at night Alex You are right Manny. I think water food and flash light have to be in the list. We should start looking for our supplies then.
