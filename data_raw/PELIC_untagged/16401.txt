I had never cooked before because my mom always prepares food. In my country the popular dish is called kabsah. It is prepared by cooking rice and chicken or meat as you like in the same pressure cooker. First put onion rings with some condiment in oil and let it to heat for minutes. Meanwhile cut chicken into small piece and melt the ice from it. Two minute later add chicken to the cooker and cover it. After ten minutes put rice into the cooker. Then add salt and any flavor you want such as green pepper tomato sauce black pepper etc. After that wait about ten minutes or when hear the sound of cooker. Then take away the cooker from the stove and pour it to serving plates. Also you can add vegetables or lemon slides on it with attracting fruits. Some people add red or yellow dye to the rice. Besides a bowl of fresh fruits which decorate the dish. Finally the delicious dish is ready for eating. In addition you can cook fish or other meat using the same steps. These steps may be vary from one to another but they share same basic steps.
