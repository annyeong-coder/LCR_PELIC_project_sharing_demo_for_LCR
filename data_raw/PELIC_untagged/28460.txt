Having grown in a small town I used to live in a very small community. Have been lived in a small community for many years my family and I became less socialism. In addition traveling to a big city to buy an outstanding clothes and other essential basics that were needed cost to much money of my family budget. Graduating from highschool I decided to move to the capital city in Saudi Arabia to get my certificate. Getting a job in Riyadh my sister decided to moved from my hometown. While studying at the King ANON_NAME_0 University I lived with my sister. After getting bachelor degree I worked to the National Information Center. When evaluated about the fantastic job I got a scholarship to get my masster's degree in Information Security. Having been student at ELI my English is improving.
