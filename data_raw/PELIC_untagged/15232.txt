My favorite place in New York is the Metropolitan Museum of Art. There are many famous masterpieces and works of art from all over the world. As you enter the museum through the main entrance of the first floor the Egyptian art gallery is on your right. European sculpture and decorative arts are directly in front of you and the Greek and Roman art is on your left. Next to that there are arts of Africa Oceania and the Americas galleries. Then the modern art is in the left corner. In the back of the museum and in the middle there is the ANON_NAME_0 Lehman Collection exhibition. On both sides there are rest rooms and elevator access. When you walk to the second floor you can notice that European paintings occupy the center part. In front of the European paintings you can find the drawings prints and photographs collections and the Chinese art. On the right side of the Chinese art there is the Japanese art. If you go back you can see the galleries of modern art and European sculptures of 18th and early 20th century on the left. Finally the ground floor occupies the Ruth and Harold D. Uris Center for Education on the left and the Cafeteria on the right. If you ever visit the Metropolitan Museum of Art you will never forget the impressions of this place.
