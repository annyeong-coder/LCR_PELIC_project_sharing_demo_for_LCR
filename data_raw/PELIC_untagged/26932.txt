Hi I'm from Saudi Arabia. I moved to Pittsburgh in 3rd of May. I've been in Pittsburgh for about 6 months. I was living in Madinah city. In Pittsburgh I like hanging out with my friends. For now I'm studying English as a second language at university of Pittsburgh. I live at Washington Plaza which it on the centre avenue. I enjoy playing soccer and I like watching movies. Okei everybody HERE I AM . .
