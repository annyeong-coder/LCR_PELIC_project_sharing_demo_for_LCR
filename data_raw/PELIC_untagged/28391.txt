When I was a child I chaired my bedroom with my brother who is two year older than me. The room has two doors one open to the balcony while the second open to the living room. The door that open to the balcony made from heavy aluminum the other door made from wood. The bed which is mine was very comfortable but my brother had uncomfortable bed. The bed that was comfortable had dark brown color.
