A serious environmental problem in my country is the construction of buildings and houses. Some irresponsible companies think that they can build everywhere that is to they believe that they can build buildings and houses cutting trees and destroying ecological areas. These indiscriminate actions have caused enormous ecological damages. Some important areas that have invaluable natural resources have suffered a great impact by companies that have as their principal objective to make money without analyzing the consequences on the environment. The most problematic ecological issue is selecting some beautiful zones to build houses for Colombian high class people who want to live surrounded by nature. However the Colombian goverment is concerned about this. For this motive laws related to the environment enforce punishments against companies that trigger a negative impact on nature. Also politicians are working on environmental plans to teach young people how to take care of our natural resources. Despite the ecological problem related to building houses this is very serious since this causes a lot of damages on nature there are alternatives to enjoy and protect our nature.
