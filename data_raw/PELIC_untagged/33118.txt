I've done my homework on time and checked the text book to find the answers to my questions. I've recited the simple past and past participle verbs and I think I've done them well. I've reviewed knowledges that I learnt from former units. These are my good habits. However I haven't previewed the unit we were going to learn next and I haven't spent my free time practicing English speaking with local people. I think I haven't used grammar in speaking well.
