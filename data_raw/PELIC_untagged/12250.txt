Though I agree with the author that giving children open ended time to deal with a particular activity or material and develop their creativity is important we still need to teach children that completing tasks on time is a kind of responsibility is the representative of being a person who is responsible to what he will do. Therefore I think when we help children to keep their creativity we also need to tell them to try their best to complete their tasks on time.
