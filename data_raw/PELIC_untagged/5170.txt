When I lived in Saudi Arabic my favorite place was the farm so I have loved that place when I have been staying in the form because when I stay there I have fled happy because I grew up in a farm and it wad beautiful place and had nice weather. I have liked to stay on the farm so I also have many others reasons about why I like farms. First I grew up in a farm that belonged to my father house was in the farm. I lived there three years so my childhood was on the farm. Second all my family had been visiting my grandfather's house on the farm and they have been doing many activities for example they have been having a new discussion every week. After that they have been eating my it was very fun. Third my friends and I had a farm. We have gone to the farm every Friday and we have sat there for four hours so we have had many activities there. For example we always swam in the swimming pool. After that some times we rode horses. Also when I stayed in the farm I have fled very wonderful. I give some example for that I have fled bad while go to the farm because it relaxes me. When I had a difficult homework I have gone there because it was a nice and beautiful place. Finally I miss this place while I live in Pittsburgh because there aren't any farms here.
