I would buy tickets to an event and I want to go to arpa concert. I like jewelry and now I want to get a ring. However the music especially arpa music is more important to me than jewelry. In addition I am not so interested in an expensive jewelry. So if I earned money I would spend it for music. When I was in Japan I went to the concert of arpa once. It was really exciting and I felt I want to play the arpa well as the musician. My dream is to play the arpa in the world. Listening to the arpa music is really fun because there are no same sounds in the music. For the arpa players the music changes a lot. It could be another music for the arrangement. So listening to arpa music which played by other players are really useful for me to study arpa. I can learned a lot of kind of arrangements. I can also learn new music and technique that how to play the difficult lism by seeing their hands. Usually we learn arpa music from their hand or our ears. So if we see their hands we can learn new technique from them. In conclusion I would buy ticket to event to enjoy concert because there are nothing that I am interested in more than music.
