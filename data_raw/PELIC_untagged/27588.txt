Too many grammar tests make me bring down. So I don't want to look over a test. But I try out my gramaar skill. So I hand my homework in to Peter. But Peter throws it away. Because he is confused with the garbages. When I heard about that I almost ran out my energy to do homework again. Although I'll do it over. Finally I figure my problem out.
