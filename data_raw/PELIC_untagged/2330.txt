Last year I had been very upset about my brother before I came to the U. S. I could not realize why he was so bossy even I did not want to talk to him. My mother worried about us very much she tried to persuade me to get better with my brother however I had never listened to her either I had no idea that why she only tried to persuade me. Just in the couple days before I left I had a serious argument with my mother. Now I have been thinking about the relationship of my family especially after the end of another relationship I realized that the most previous emotion exist in the family. I am sorry for having argument with my mother. I should have known as a mother she always tries to do her best to complete her family. I should have talked with my brother before I judged his behavior. Being the eldest child in my family he always shares his experiences and tries to protect us in his way. I should not have been so mean to him before I left my home. Fortunately now I understand it I could think about what I should do when the same situation is happened. If I feel uncomfortable about what my brother do I will let him know it in a mild way. Also I could do the same thing as what my mother does. There is nothing more important than my family after all.
