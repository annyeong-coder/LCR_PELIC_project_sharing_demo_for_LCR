What shocked me was the snow storm couple moth ago. The fact that this snowstorm is considered the biggest snow storm in the history of Pittsburgh. What shocked me is that the amount of snow. I wonder why many restaurants were closed during that snow storm. The mystery is how some drivers could drive cars during the storm. It's amusing that the ELI organized skiing trip during the snow. I am uncertain whether the ELI students like the trip. I am impressed by the fact that many ELI's students and faculties participated in that trip. I believe that the trip was unique. I told ANON_NAME_0 that she was a good organizer.
