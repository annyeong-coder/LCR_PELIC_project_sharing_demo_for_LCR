Usually in my country I eat our tradtional food wich is rise and checkin. But some times when I hang out with my friends I eat fast food. But let me tell you what the difference between the healthy food and the fast food. Home made food is healhier than fast food but fast food is isn't as healthier as home made food. Home made food is as healthy as any kind of organic food. Fast food isn't as healthy as a organic food but organic food is better and healthier than fast food. So I advice all the people to eat healthy food all the time to be fit and healthy the whole life.
