Stereotype of social groups invariably prove incomplete and biased. Walter Lippman Every culture has it own stereotype some of them are facts but some of them are biased and it reflects a wrong picture for the culture. For example the stereotype of my country that my country is a desert and we live in tent and we still use camels as a transportation and that is wrong. It is true that my county is a desert but we have been developing our country for years we have buildings roads cars and houses to live in not in a tent and we do not use camels for transportation everything is not like the other still thought a bout my country.
