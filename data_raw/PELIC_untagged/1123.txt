I find on a website ANON_URLSITE_how the Coca Cola become larger Can you believe that in the 1950s Coca Cola was packaged in 6. 5 Ounce bottles No one even makes those anymore. Twelve ounce cans came next and now you can get a super sized soft drink at a fast food restaurant containing 42 oz. That's more than one liter! The original Coke was 81 calories. The super sized beverage is 410 calories it would be more but you get lots of ice included . This shows how every thing became bigger and bigger. Be careful do not think that super size meals are good on the contrary they are very harmful for your life. In my point of view the companies should have strict rules for their portions size.
