One and half years ago I decided to come to the US to help my wife recover from a chronic disease. If I had not decided to come here I would stay in China now and I would be much happier with my old friends around me. It would have been easy to keep in good touch with them. I also would visit my parents very often. If I were in China I might have continued to work as a project manager in China office of an American company I ever worked for before or I might have jumped to another world top data storage company and now I would be in a senior management position. Or I might had begun another startup in Beijing China and now I would be very busy with running it. But if I had stayed in China in the past year I wouldn't have helped my wife recover from a chronic disease. I wouldn't have visited so many cities and wonderful scenic sites of the US. Also I wouldn't be taking classes in the ELI of Pitt. I wish I could come back to China at the end of this year to visit my parents and my siblings
