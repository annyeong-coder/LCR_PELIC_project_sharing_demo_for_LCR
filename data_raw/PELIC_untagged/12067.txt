I have been in Pittsburgh for nine months. I like the life here because being in another city from your original city is a wonderful experience. The amazing thing about the experience is finding the differences such as the weather number of universities and the nature and similarities such as the food and the design of building between my city and Pittsburgh. The weather in Pittsburgh is totally different from Riyadh. In Pittsburgh it snows and very cold in winter and it is wet in the summer . In addition it rains often in all the seasons in Pittsburgh. On the other hands it never snows in Riyadh in winter and the climate is dry in the summer. In addition Pittsburgh's nature is like a forest . It has many kinds of flowers and trees where as Riyadh kind of desert . Another difference Pittsburgh has more than tow universities. However Riyadh has only one university. People in Pittsburgh like to eat fast food like people in Riyadh. Another similarity is Pittsburgh has down town and the buildings are very high like wise Riyadh. Another thing is that both of cities has no seas Even though there are some similarities between Riyadh and Pittsburgh like the food and design of buildings . But Pittsburgh is totally different from my home town in many ways. Such as weather the number of universities and the nature.
