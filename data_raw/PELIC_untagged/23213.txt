Children come to school every day. Their parents want them be creative in the future. As soon as they study in their school they will feel happy but year after year they will become bored of school since their schools do not let them do whatever they want. In fact they impose children to do the thing that they believe is true. Therefore children cannot become creative. On the other hand if you let them go in their inclinations they will be able to create. An example to support this information is Saudi guy who has become technologies creature.
