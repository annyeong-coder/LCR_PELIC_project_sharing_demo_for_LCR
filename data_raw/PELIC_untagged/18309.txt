When I was serving in military our company visited a place where handicapped people stay. On arriving in the place we stopped talking and looked at the people. Not meeting other people who are not disabled they welcomed us. Being disabled they could speak something simple. Among them I saw a kid who doesn't have arms. When it was lunch time I tried to feed her. When I picked up the spoon with meshed potato she opened her mouth. Unless somebody helps her eat she cannot eat by herself. Before helping her I didn't know how disabled people feel and how they live. After visiting the place I changed my opinion about handicapped people. Seeing handicapped people I try to help them. I realized that they are not different. My thought was different. I will help them whenever I can help them.
