My grandfather passed away 5 years ago I was undergraduate at that time he had a heart attack. My parents and my sisters were their when he passed away but I was at home studying for my exam since that day I always say to myself I should not have stayed at home that day I could have preformed CPR for him they should have called the ambulance earlier the ambulance ought to have came earlier I should have spent that time with my grandfather instead of studying.
