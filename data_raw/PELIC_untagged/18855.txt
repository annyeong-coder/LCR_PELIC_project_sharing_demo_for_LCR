My father helped me find my future profession. When I was a child he had me think about various mathematical topics. Then we had discussions about them. He used to give me a lot of problems to solve and he let me use any book from his library. He didn't make me study anything I was reluctant to but he tried to explain it to me and then gave me the exercises to improve my knowledge. When I finished high school I wanted to be a journalist but he got me to apply for Physics. Now I am sure that I made a wise choice.
