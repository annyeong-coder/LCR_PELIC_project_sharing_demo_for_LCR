The first time when I help my host family at their restaurant it is also the first time I pick up the phone here. At that time I am surprised I can take order. Sometimes I do not understand what the customer said I figured out by saying sorry can you say it again . If I do not understand again I will say hold on a second and give the phone to my friend. I do not give up or lost face I will keep on trying again next time. The reason is I came here to learn english and practice more but not to be a perfect man in English. Every time I have done a mistake I can learn more knowledge from that.
