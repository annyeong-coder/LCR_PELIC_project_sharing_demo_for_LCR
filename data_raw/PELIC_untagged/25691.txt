I spend to much time at Tazzadoro coffee shop. This is the coffee shop of my neighborhood Highland Park. When I go at 2 00 pm Tazzadoro is empty up but the people go back to the coffee approximately at 3 30. In this place I find out many interesting thighs about the life of Americans. For instance I see like the Americans get together with their friends and they share their experience of daily life. Many people talk over about their job or familiar subjects. Other people talk about their let down experience. A coffee shop is an interesting place for learn some subject of the life in a country. In my case I think back on my life in Bogota when I spent time in my favorite coffee shop ANON_NAME_0 Valdez. Definitely the American baristas may make up a method that let theim dream up new marriage between the typical American gastronomy and the coffee. This is a place in which I look over different points of the America life.
