First time when I came Holiday hotel I couldn't order any dishes. First of all I couldn't figure out that strange answering machine and I several times called back same number. And also too many times I hang up the phone while processing connect menu. Eventually I gave up order any food and just went to outside bought some food. Every morning when I woke up immedietly I went to outside for breakfast. It's little bit hard time for me.
