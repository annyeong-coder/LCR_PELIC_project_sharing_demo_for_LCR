This is an experience that I have had about You can't please everyone . There is a child who sells necklaces of flower to cars' drivers on a street in Bangkok Thailand. When I saw a child I bought a necklace of flower from him. My friend saw that and said Don't buy it from the child because you're pushing him into danger. If you buy it it means you encourage him to do this job. It will be dangerous to him to sell necklaces on a street. Maybe he is clashed by a car. It isn't good. But another one said I don't think so. Maybe he has to do this because his family doesn't have money. He has to get money to support his family. It's useful for him. You were right about that. You can support him and his family. While we discuss about the topic another one who is not two above persons said If you want to get a necklace of flower just do that. You don't have to care what happens to him because it has both advantage and disadvantage in same situation. However I just bought the necklace of flower from the child. I agreed with the last person. His sale has both advantage and disadvantage. The child has to decide for himself.
