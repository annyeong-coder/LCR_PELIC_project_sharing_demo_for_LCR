Sometimes arbitrary choice make the life totally different way. Choosing the major is arbitrary for me. I was not interested in education or korean literature before I had chosen my major. Having chosen my majors which were education and korean literature I fell in love with them. First of all educating children who are not loved by their parents is not favorable but having loved them they were changing slowly. Teacher should show them unlimited love which is totally different from their parent's. I experienced that a child not being obeying anything had changed to a good one. Second korean is very logical and scientific language. Learning korean literature is ambiguous but can attribute me to get a jobs. Because there are many jobs relating korean literature. When someone need to write an abstract for coference Korean literature is needed. It is a crucial skill for any field in Korea. That's all of my reasons to choose my major.
