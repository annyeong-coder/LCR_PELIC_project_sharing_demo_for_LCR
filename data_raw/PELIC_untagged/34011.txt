Hello the reason why I am writing this e mail is that I would like to ask for your advice about my roommate. She used to be an honest and cheeful girl. However she has changed like a different person recently. She may act with bad friends. She comes back our dorm after 2 AM every day. She usually late for or skip her classes. She does not straighten up our room. She is always in a bad mood so I hesitate to speak to her. To make matters worse she might smoke marijuana. I am worried about her and I want her to reform herself. What should I do Thank you for your letter. I would like to suggest you should change your roommate. You should think about yourself firstly. When you request it to your school they must ask the reason. And then you should tell everything. They may contact her parents and in some cases report police or a hospital. This problem must be serious so you had better not try to solve by yourself. If you follow my suggestion you can solve this ploblem keeping with her relationship. I wish you good luck!
