KIWI Now we have these things we only have one bottle of water it can't be enough. ANON_NAME_0 yeah we had better find another one and fill water. KIWI we don't have any food we have to find some bread. ANON_NAME_0 I think we ought to find sleeping bag although we have blankets but they might not keep us warm at night. KIWI sure since we decided what we need we should begin gather everything now we don't have much time we only have two hours.
