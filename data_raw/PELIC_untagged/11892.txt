A human being have to breathe in fresh air. Unless the air subsists in the world not only the human being but also breathing animals and plants aren't able to survive. However nowadays the air the most important thing into the earth is contaminated by urbanization and industrialization. Although most people recognize about the importance of air quality just a few people make an endeavor for improving the air quality. If air pollution is getting seriously more and more we may buy an exygen inhaler to survive in the near future. Water is one of the suitable cases. By about 10 years nobody had anticipated that people might buy some bottles of water in a market or CVS. However almost all people are drinking water after buying in a close market. In this way we might purchase a large quantity of fresh air in an air store since it isn't believed that the air which is in the atmosphere is fresh. Recently government of the United Kingdom strengthened the policy that regulates the existing emission standard of cars more intensely. As a result the problem of air pollution is the most crucial issue. Therefore we have to find a method of settlement in order to improve the air quality.
