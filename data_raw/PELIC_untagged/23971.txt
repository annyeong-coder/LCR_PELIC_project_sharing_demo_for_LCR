A place that is special to me I have a special place in my country. That is for meet with fiends. We get it sharing annual rent. This place like small farm. It is surrounded by a fence. In side small garden includes flowers and green grass. Also we have a big tradition tent. As well room keeper and kitchen. The tent contain a big wendow on view the garden. And we have a big plasma T. V. To watch sports and movies. When we meet in there we make hoka cook food and play cards. This is my special place for me.
