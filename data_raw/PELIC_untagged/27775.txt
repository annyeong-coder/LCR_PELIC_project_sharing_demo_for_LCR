Comment This book is hard to summarize because time goes back and forth. Henry's time traveling mixes time orders up. I think this is appropriate time to change the book because it seems this book is hard to summarize and there are many unfamiliar vocabulary for me. I thought I can go over those vocabularies but as I read more and more there are almost more than 5 words which I don't know on a page. Also the story isn't going sequentially. I think it isn't too late to choose another book and read. I had conversation with classmates in the class when we discussed with partners and a classmate recommended me a book which he read and he said vocabularies in the book is not that hard and it's shorter than mine. So I'm thinking of changing the book. Is it ok for curriculum Or should I keep reading this book
