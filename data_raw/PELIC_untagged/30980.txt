Friday is my weekly holiday Ii's crucial day because I usually attend the Friday lecture and pray in a mosque and I meet my friends and form new relationships with new persons. Unlike Sunday I frequently do my daily life activities and prepare myself for a new next week. Friday also is the time to communicate with my family and relatives in my country so I phone them or chat with them by internet and then I fall asleep after I have finished all that. Friday day is a great chance to enhance my relationships with others since I'm usually busy during weekdays. However I don't like to meet anyone during Sunday because there are many tasks I should do them and I should finish them during this day. If I don't finish these tasks on Sunday I will be so exhausted in the week after that Sunday. I usually cook my food during both Friday and Sunday because I like home made food. Also I clean my apartment study and check my emails or facebook account. In fact these tasks I often do them every day whatever that day is I should achieve them because they are essential tasks which means that I can delay them even though I am busy.
