I think I should choose matches an knife and chocolate. First matches not only can light at night but also can make us feel warm. Second if you want to cut some food or hunt animals for food you have to have an knife. Furthermore you also can use the knife to protect yourself in a desert island. Finally chocolate is the most important thing which you had better have because it can support and storage your energy!
