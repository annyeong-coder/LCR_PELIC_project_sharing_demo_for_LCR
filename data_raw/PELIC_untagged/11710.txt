Banality of evil literally means familiarity of evil. This phrase is strange because evil cannot be a familiar action. The behavior of evil is performed by ordinary people who might do horrible things even though they don't have hostilities or animosities. People do that to obey authority in such an automatic way they just do what people in power ask them to do. I think that people in most cultures are raised to obey rules in their lives with their families and schools.
