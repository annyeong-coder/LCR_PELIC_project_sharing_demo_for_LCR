My family consisted of my parents and two brothers and young sister and me. My old brother has married for two years ago. He has two childs and lives with my parents now. After that I married in January this year. I have moved to my husband's house since January. Five months ago I was thinking about my job. I have had some problems of my career for six years. My husband encouraged me to learn something new or take rest. So I have decided to go to Pittsburgh for studying English. English has been so difficult. I have read and written it every day. I miss my family and my husband. And I have not stopped worrying about my English all the time.
