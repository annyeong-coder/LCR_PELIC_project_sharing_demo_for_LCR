My home makes me feel good especially my bedroom. When my parents set up my room they let me choose the wall color of my room. I choose a color which is light purple between light pink it is full of warming atmosphere and makes me feel comfortable. I like to hang up my awards and favorite pictures on the wall. However there is a problem which I put it off for a long time. There is a lot of stuff in my room. I know I have to clean it up and throw away many things which I won't use them anymore. I should not always count on my mother to help me straighten up my room.
