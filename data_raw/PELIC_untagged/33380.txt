Yes I would like to live on liesureville not permanently. Because of the variety of facilities for the activities where senior citizens talk share their memories and dance as one family. Staying away from crowded cities air pollution and also isolated from society. I really love being in a place where I can find people would serve me when I get old. So I can live the meaning of slogan golden age with carefree and happiness.
