I agree the opinions expressed in the text. I think the corporations are powerful institutions. When they only pursue the profits they would hurt environment and public. Addition because they are powerful they can use their advertising and marketing power to guide people protect the environment and strengthen the welfare of communities. Some corporations are taking step and adopt policies to protect the environment and communities but these changes are too slow and we don't have so much time to wait all corporation voluntarily come around. Therefore I think we should ask legislators enact the law to create corporate managers' new motivations and justify antisocial corporate behavior. The law is clear to corporate managers that they should protect the public interest before they pursue shareholders interest. Besides it can remove the corporation's excuse for behaving irresponsibly.
