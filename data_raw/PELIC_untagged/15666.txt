How do you change classrooms Teresa Mar 07 2009 I would like to tear the wall down after looking the classroom up. In my opinion this size of classroom is too small for fifteen students. In the beginning I would like to put the stuff on the top of the closet away cover up the desk in front of the board with beautiful clothes. And I am going to take the shutters down pick some curtains out from IKEA. It is too dark for our reading I will light the classroom up hang up some pictures of scene. I believe students will cheer up after redecoration it 's worth trying out.
