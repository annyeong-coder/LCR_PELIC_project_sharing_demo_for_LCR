Before I came to the U. S. I had been in vacation for one month. I had been reading a book in body language and since that time I have decided to improve my communication skills based on the same concepts. I had been learning how to control my reaction in different situations. Also I had been trying to read the body language of people based on the context. In addition I had read five books written one short story had a cooking class and participated in many social activities. I had decided not to give up in anything and try new things in life when I had the chance to do so.
