Some kinds of animals may extinct after several decades. I would like to put some kinds of money in a time capsule. Because people may use different current system. I would like to put a cup of rice in a time capsule. Because people in the future will not eat it as a main food. I would like to put an oilcan in a time capsule. The oil may run out in the future. People remember they used to use the oil as a main energy. I would like to put a world map in a time capsule. The landform may change because of disaster.
