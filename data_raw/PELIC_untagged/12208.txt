Two Chinese people are traveling in Spain. One day they walk into a restaurant to have breakfast. They know that they can not speak Spanish and the waiter also cannot speak English. Therefore the most important problem is how they can communicate with the waiter. What they want to have for the breakfast are two sandwiches and two glasses of milk. At first they ask the waiter if they have milk but the waiter cannot understand what they are talking about. Finally one of them comes up with a piece of paper and a pencil and draws a cow. Before he finishes the drawing the waiter just runs out of the restaurant quickly. The man who draws the cow said to his friend It's really useful that people bring a small pencil when they encounter difficulties in a foreign country! A few minutes later the waiter returns. He just gives them two tickets of watching a bullfight.
