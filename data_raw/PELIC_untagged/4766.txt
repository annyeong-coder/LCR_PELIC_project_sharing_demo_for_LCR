I would like to put three kinds of objects in the time capsule. The first thing is my 300 giga bite memory card. It is able to save many things such as pictures voices moving images and documents. In addition I will choose some stocks. If the value of my stock is increased my descendants would have much money. And they can learn about economic conditions in past times. Finally I will leave my blood which is iced. Then my descendants might be able to reproduce my body. If they are successful they will be able to figure out the condition of their ancestor's health. In conclusion a memory card stocks and my blood in the time capsule will represent the present time.
