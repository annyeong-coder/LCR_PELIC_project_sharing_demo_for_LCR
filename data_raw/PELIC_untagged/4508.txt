I watched commercial advertisement quite a lot on TV for Memorial Day. So I expected a livelier day on Memorial Day. On the contrary I felt the atmosphere was very relaxed and quiet. I couldn't hear any noise from the street in the morning and there seemed to be no cars passing by On the way to a park with my family in the afternoon I saw some people surrounding a monument. The music which I heard from the ceremony and the countenances which I watched from the people were full of seriousness. I did not check all over the places on that day but from some parts that I experienced and felt I thought people might have had more quiet surroundings on Memorial Day.
