A few years ago I went to Bariloche and I took some camping equipment. I saw a lot of animals there and I hiked a lot. I took a sleeping bag and some matches. I took a lot of beans but I forgot some rice. When I was riding I saw a beautiful animal crossed in front of me. It was a deer. I did not see any wolves. I took enough water but any chocolate. I am going to go next year so I will take several chocolates.
