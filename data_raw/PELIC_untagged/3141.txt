Saudi Arabian women The women in Saudi Arabia have special lives. Fifty years ago all women didn't work outside the home because they cooked the food and cleaned the home for their family. These days the country has improved so many women work outside for example they work in the school or in the hospital. The women have special clothes. For example they wear black clothes because their religion says that. In my opinion the women had easy lives 50 years ago and they still have easy lives today.
