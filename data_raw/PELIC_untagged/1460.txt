I don't think men and women should live in different world. I think if they separated they couldn't feel better because men and women need each other every time. Sometimes men can't do what women do so if they worked together they would help companies very well. In hospital women and men usually go to same hospital but sometimes women want to go to man doctor because he is very good so women might get bad medication if women went to bad women doctor because men and women should be separate.
