At first my apartment in Pitts brought me down because there was no much furniture the walls were dirty and kitchen table was disgusting. My realtor let me down because he kept out this information. Therefore I had to think it over and I decided to touch some stuff up. For example I had to paint the living room and buy new chairs to dinner room as well as I had to go to pick up a new kitchen table. After that I threw away the lamps of the bedroom because they were not working. The new lamps light it up a lot and now my bedroom is bright. Actually my apartment looks better and cheers me up. Because my friend lives so far away I try to talk her into to come over but she always puts off the visit.
