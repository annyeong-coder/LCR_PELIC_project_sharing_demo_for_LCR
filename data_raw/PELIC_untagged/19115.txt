If tourism to my country double in the next 20 years the effects will be two sided. Good things that will happen are easy to see. Not only large quantity of tourists will stimulate the economic development but also our country will have good opportunities to have our colorful culture be known by every corner of the world. A few bad things can also happen. For example it will become more difficult to maintain pristine natural scenes to keep environment clean and people living in tour cities will be more or less affected especially by special events such as Olympics. Whether the effects are good or not the government have to front the people help them adapt to the possible life style change and let the people know that everyone's contribution is invaluable.
