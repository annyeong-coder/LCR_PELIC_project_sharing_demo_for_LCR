I was born in Bangkok in 1987. I was growing up over there over there. I was really fat when I studied in primary school. I was a stupid crazy student in my class. My teacher always yelled at me everyday. But I didn't angry him at all. At that time I was like a big fat kid that always sat in the back of the class and always read the comics books. Anyway what about my travel life I have been Canada 1 time when I was 16 years old. I went there with my family. We spent time over there 2 weeks. It was the nice trip for me. Actually I have been many countries such as France Italy England . . . Etc but the most happiness trip for me is Canada. I also have been many place in U. S. Such as Denver L. A. New york . . . Etc. I think Pittsburgh is the quiet bored city but good place for studying. However I proud that I'm the part of the Steelers country. Actually I have tried to play the flag football which is look like football but I didn't do well. However I'm still love this sport. And I'm a big fan of Steelers as you do.
