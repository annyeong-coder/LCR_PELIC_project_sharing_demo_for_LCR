The author thinks that most children always lose the sense of pleasure in their own learning during the third or fourth year. However I disagree with his opinion. I think children can also keep their creativity during the third or fourth year even during higher grades if teachers and parents can give them a good environment to develop their creativity. For example the children who attend art school usually do not lose creativity because their school environment and activities are very creative.
