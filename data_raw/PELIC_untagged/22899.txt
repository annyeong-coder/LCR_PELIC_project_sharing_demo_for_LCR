Bill Gates was talking about how the energy affected the climate and suggested the world to produce zero carbon dioxide emission energy. He explained that to get lower price of energy they needed to deal with carbon dioxide but this procedure lead to increasing temperature that caused negative effect to ecology system collapse. To stop rising temperature he influenced us to employ zero carbon dioxide emission energy. The carbon emission factor consisted of population service efficient and amount of carbon dioxide which was the most crucial factor. To reduce amount of carbon dioxide needed a new of energy system called energy miracle such as nuclear geothermal wind and solar energy. Regardless the problems for example cost and efficient He supported them. He showed that Terrapower was the nuclear power using the depleted Uranium to produce energy. Instead of burning 1 of Uranium and released them as a depleted Uranium Terrapower used 99 of Uranium. Moreover he triggered the world to set the target. By the end of 2020 20 reduction of carbon dioxide and zero carbon dioxide emission would be progressing. Also by the end of 2050 80 reduction of carbon dioxide and zero carbon dioxide emission deploy in developed country. He concluded his speech with his one wish research funding in carbon dioxide market in carbon dioxide energy entrepreneurs opportunities and rational framework in zero carbon dioxide emission.
