I had had a lot of new experiences When I came to the US for the first time. I got lost in Washington and Pittsburgh too. By the time I had learned that I should know the address because I could not give directions to taxi drivers. When I found a place to live in I had faced some problems in speaking English on the phone to start the services. By May 4th I had already cooked my first meal. When I came here I had never driven a car before.
