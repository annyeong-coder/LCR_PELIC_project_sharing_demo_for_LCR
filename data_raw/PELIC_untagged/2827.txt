I have loved many people but like my father I never love someone. He is the best person I have ever seen. He is so smart he thinks any many way. If he has a problem he looks into it any many way. Also he was an offecior so he is so serious. A have not found any person had a problem with him or hate him. However he is my father. Who take care of me when I was child. So I love him so much and I hope I can spend the rest of my live close to him.
