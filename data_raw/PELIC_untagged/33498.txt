Although Rock of Ages tried to make people laugh That's My Boy is the movie that succeeded in doing it. Whereas Rock of Ages featured Tom Cruise That's My Boy starred Adam Sandler. That's My Boy focused mainly focused on two characters but Rock of Ages had a big cast sharing the spotlight. Rock of Ages was rather generic and adaptable however That's My Boy was quite daring and possibly even controversial. Unlike Rock of Ages I found That's My Boy quite enjoyable.
