I'd like tell you about my favorite place to eat lunch. First I don't like food that is salted. But I like some of meat. 1 Month ago my family who are older sister and sister's husband and nephew and me went to the North park so that we might barbecue there. North park is so huge and clean. There were many flat benches for people. Before the day it had been rain. Fortunately it was clear and bright. Accordingly there were many people who took some exercise like jogging. We occupied the table. While my sister was preparing the lunch I was playing with my nephew. It was my favorite place to eat lunch to me.
