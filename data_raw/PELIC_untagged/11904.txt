My father always says that I am a girl who can spend all of her money in a couple of days. So I often ran out of money in the end of a month when I was young. My husband who was a graduate student a few years ago also had not much money at that time. One day after one day's work I wanted to have dinner with him together. But I only have 1 Yuan in my purse. At that time my husband was still my boyfriend. So when he heard I have no money for dinner he said he would treat me. Then he began to try to find more money in the mess. At last we found 15 Yuan totally. It was just the price of 2 dishes. But when we sat in the front of the table and made our orders my husband suddenly said to the waitress Please add one more dessert. I was shocked!!!! I kicked my husband's feet under the table to imply that we had not enough money pay the dessert. But my husband insisted to add a dessert with my kick on his feet. After the waitress left I complained to my husband Are you crazy How can we pay the bill My husband looked at me with a smile and peace face. He said Forget the business of money just enjoy your dessert first. Anyway we had already ordered the dessert. Let it be! However after we finished all the things my husband suddenly took 5 Yuan from his pocket and said Guess! I just find I have another 5 Yuan in my pocket! Ha! I can't believe that. I always remember the happiness of that moment.
