I used to live in Korea. I used to collect stamp as hobby. I used to play soccer everyday. I used to study almost mathmetics. I used to play comptuter game everyday. Today I am living in Pittsburgh. And I do not collect stamp anymore. I am playing basketball once a week. I am studying only english. I am playing computer game about once a week.
