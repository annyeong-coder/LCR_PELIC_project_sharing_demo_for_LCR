I think everybody can create art in its individual way. There are many ways to create art such as drawing painting making sculpture and so on. If the person find the kind of art that he or she likes then they should start spontaneously. This is a really good way to be creative don't think about what you want to do just try. After that you can analyze it and try it again. So that you can increase your skills of creativity. The beginning to learn creativity should be for you not for a corporate purpose.
