I have learned English for many years in Korea while I have learned English for only 45 days in the U. S. Even though I have been in the U. S. For a while I can definitely distinguish what are similarities and differences of teaching and learning English between the two countries. Overall instruction methods in class in the U. S. PARALLEL our own. For instance the teachers check attendance and teach us based on the textbook. Also students are supposed to be polite during class both in Korea and in the U. S. On the other hand the UNDERLYING purpose of teaching English for teachers is somewhat different between the two countries. In Korea teachers focus on reading and listening which are courses students have to take in the exam. That is the main purpose of instructing English for teachers in Korea is to help students get good grades on tests whereas the major aim of teaching English for teachers in the U. S. Is to help students learn English for practical use. I think teachers should adopt not only a theoretical approach but also a practical approach in order to instruct their students well.
