Cultural Expectations of Success for Males and Females in China There are different cultural expectations of success for males and females in China. In my opinion there are many reasons for this the job market background of person life of value and attitude and responsibility for family. Here I will talk about the job market. In China males and females both have a chance to get a good job but opportunities for males are greater than for females. In general males think if they earn a lot of money they are successful. They expect to support their family by themselves. They don't like their wives going to work. If a wife earns more salary than her husband it is trouble for the relationship. Her husband will feel challenged and he will lose confidence. There are also problems becoming a successful woman. Females think they must go to work because if they get a job they will feel safe and independent but if they want to get a good job it is too difficult for them many companies think if females are married they can't work well. A woman needs time to give birth to her child and she needs to spend time looking after her child. Therefore many companies give job offers to males more than females. I think becoming successful females are more difficult than becoming successful males because there are different cultural expectations of success for males and females in China.
