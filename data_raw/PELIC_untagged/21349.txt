I have been in the US for one year and three months already. I personally did enhance a lot of speaking skill especially with the native speakers. Eventhough my grammar and writing are not improve significantly I try my best to maximize my learning ability to the highest or at least to sustain the ability that I already had. Besides from the classroom I had a good chance to meet one native speaker who is currently learning sign language. She taught me some sign and I really like it. This really trigger my interest of learning sign language. In my spare time I try to practice speaking sign language by myself via youtube and now I am addicted to it. Some of my friends asked me why do I interested in learning sign language. So I have to give them a rational justification to clarify their doubt. However right now there is something else that I have to concentrate first that is preparing for the GMAT test. Now I am taking a private gmat course and I have to do a lot of gamt home work. I believe that doing lots of exercise can reinforce my ability to do the test better. However the proportion of time doing homework for the ELI and GMAT is not that great as I thought. I felt very sorry that I spend more time on the gamt homework than the ELI homework.
