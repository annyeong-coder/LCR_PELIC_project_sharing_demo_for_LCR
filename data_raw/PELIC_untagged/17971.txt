My topic is A good man finds all the world friendly. I think this sentence is hard to understand but in my own A good man who are a gentlemen have all the relationship with friend. So the world friendly that is infer to the best relationship of all friend. In short I disagree because a woman who is a wonderful can finds all the world friendly too. For example my friend whose is a best habit have a good relationship with man and women. So I think not only the man but which everybody can have a world friendly with friendly. If you have a best relationship with your friend.
