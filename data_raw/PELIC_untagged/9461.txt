My name is Elif and I came from Turkey. I'm taking an ESL course this semester. Our teacher wants me to write about myself and my hobbies. I live in my own world. I'm a witdrawn person. I have a scrapbook and my whole life is hidden in this book. I write in my journal everyday. I often write about my feelings and thoughts. I don't worry about my spelling punctution or grammer in my journal. Right now I'm sitting in a cafe and I'm thinking about my homework what can I write Maybe I should write about my future. Now I'm studying English in Pittsburgh because I want to apply to graduate scholl at Pitt. I'm asking myself why do I want to live in Pittsburgh because I like to live in a small city and I like my school the University of Pittsburgh.
