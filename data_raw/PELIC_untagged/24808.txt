As rescuers struggled to search for the 46 missing sailors of the naval ship Cheonan that sank in the West Sea a week ago the nation continued to mourn a Navy warrant officer who perished while conducting an underwater operation Tuesday. Warrant Officer Han Joo ho of Underwater Demolition Team died after complaining of breathing difficulties and losing consciousness during an operation near the submerged stern. He was one of the first divers to arrive at the wreckage. He will go in everyday and search all the cabins although it was too dangerous to dive three to four times a day. He said that the families of the missing soldiers are overwhelmed up with anxiety. He also said that no one worried about me being better experienced. ' He just couldn't sit idly by while his subordinates were going in the treacherous waters. I think a true hero was born through his noble sacrifice. I am quite relieved that there are people like Han protecting our country.
