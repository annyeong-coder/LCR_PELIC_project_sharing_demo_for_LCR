When I was in middle school my friends and I went to amusement park on holiday. Though it was raining very strongly we could play well because it was indoor park. Playing a lot we left there for home. However all of sudden 4 5 bad guys approached us and asked money we had. They were much older and stronger than us so we gave all money to them. After that we got to have nothing in our pockets. During that one old woman saw us and helped us by giving some quarters. Thanks to the woman I could call my dad and he took all of us home safely. At that time I felt the importance of money and quarters.
