I think it is reasonable to see the scrap trade show us the global economy because we could follow the destination of the scrap and we could actually see the meaning of the trash to China. I think trade means give and take and there are two countries which actually do that. U. S sells their trash to China and China sells the product made from it. Therefore we could see the value of the scrap when it was sold by tracking it and we could understand the trade between U. S and China from the scrap trade.
