I think Dr. Schwartz's advice is useful for those who are using online dating progress. This could be a great guideline for these people. There are two most valuable key points I agree. First be careful about your personal information. I totally agree with it because you can not anticipate what may be happened through the Internet world. Second be happy if you really want to enjoy the trip. Having a good attitude to people is definitely a good thing for everyone. Nobody need be tense just try to be optimistic and everybody will be have a good time.
