If I won Thirty Million dollars would that change my life completly. First of all I would stop working Probably not finish the ELI curse place maybe 20 millions of them in investments. And then take the rest and buy a frist class ticket to Indonesia or an other exotic country take a cap to my new two million dollar house that I just bought buy a Lamborghini. And then call my family and my closest friends buy fly tickets for them and then enjoy a cuple of weeks with them before I take off with my friends to investigate the rest of world. And after a numbers of years of traveling would I start my own company. Maybe a cloth brant that hopefully will be successful get a beautiful family in a fantastic place. Make sure that my kids get a good education etc. Spoil all the people in my surrounding and just live my life as I want but still keep a strict structure budget and now your limits.
