I have a good relationship with my high school teacher. We first met at a bus. It was my first time to go high school and I did not know where I got off. Someone who was good looking and tall saw me and he introduced kindly the station where I had to get off. After that situation I could go school and I was waiting for a class teacher. When the door was opening I was surprised to see him. It was him who introduced me in the bus. His subject was math and he taught very easily to the students. While I was fighting with a question he made me find the answer. Always he called me when I was absent from school for reason of health and cheered me up. I did not forget his favor and I continued the relationship with him.
