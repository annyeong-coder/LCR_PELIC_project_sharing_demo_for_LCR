There are more and more animals which are threatened with extinction. One of representative examples is big cats lions tigers panthers jaguars cheetahs and so on. Big cats are being deprived of their own places. Losing their places means that they have fewer chances to hunt for food. Actually it is not only a big cat's problem but every animal's problem. The larger peoples' territory becomes the more endangerd big cats' existence is. We human beings should stop expanding territories for the sake of ourselves. In addition we have to learn how to live together with other species.
