When I arrived in Pittsburg my target was two main things one of them is I have to study English so I have been studying English for one year. At the first it was very hard to study a new language because I haven't study English before but now I'm feeling comfortable toward English except TOFEL. I have taken TOFEL exam two times but I wasn't able to pass it. Anyway I must pass TOFEL exam and I have to get the score which all universities are requesting it. Another object which I'm looking for is studying master degree in physical therapy field. That cause I have applied more than four applications for various universities so I have never gotten an acceptance yet from them. Finally I hope achieve my goal as soon as possible.
