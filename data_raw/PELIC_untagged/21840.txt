The worst meal experience I have had is in Pittsburgh. Last time I went to LULU'S which is a chinese restraunt. I ordered a Krean food but I can not remember the name. The food is kind of rice with some vegetable. There were some vegetable on the rice also it had several eggs. I ate nothing that day. It was terrible.
