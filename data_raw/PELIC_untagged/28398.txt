I had my own small bed room which had two doors. In my room my bed was in a conner left which was close to the windows. There was a desk which was between my bed and the front door. On the desk there was a family picture which we took when we went to the beach where we usually took vacation. On the right there was a laundry basket in which I put my dirty clothes was in a middle between back door and a closet. Next to my room is my brother's room. My brother whose room was bigger than mine always came to my room for candy. There was a little space between our room which we shared a sofa TV radio and magazines. But I still liked the living room where we were all together after dinner.
