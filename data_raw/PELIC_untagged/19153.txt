When I was young I didn't like the seafoods. But now I like almost all kinds of the food. Although I like most food I thought that the rotten bean curd in china was worst food I have ever had. There were so many street venders. They were selling many kinds of strange food For example fried scorpions grilled lizards. I decided to buy a black skewered food. I bit a liitle of bean curd. Its taste and smell were very weird. The taste of it was like sour melon and the smell was like as a decayed egg's. I couldn't eat all of them. I don't know how I could try to eat it! Maybe I can't eat at all the rotten food.
