In 2002 while I was going home I met my friend who I had not seen for 10 years. His name is Cengiz. When I got off the bus he knew me. I was looking at him and he was looking at me. It was a surprise for him and me. After this astonishment we started to walk. While we were walking we were talking. It was late. While we were talking my wife called me and asked Where are you After that I met Cengiz every week or every month. Finally when I was working in my office Cengiz came there and saw me off about three weeks ago.
