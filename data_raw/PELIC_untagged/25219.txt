When we celebrate the New Year in Korea We celebrate this holiday in the lunar calendar. It is one of the biggest holidays. I am always happy whenever I have this holiday because I can be relaxed and I can have lots of delicious food for a few days. We do many things such as a ceremony for ancestors a formal bow to elders and a visit to our ancestor's grave. First all relatives gather a house of their eldest brother in the morning on this day. We always prepare a great deal of food on this day before. We set a table and arrange a food to have a ceremony for an ancestor. We perform the ceremony after we finish the setting to prepare the ceremony. The purpose that we have a ceremony for ancestors is to treat and to respect them. Second we normally bow formally to an elder. Young people should bow to their living elders to respect and pray that elders live for a long time. Elders usually give words of blessing to young people after young people bow to them. Sometimes elders give money to young people. It means that they want young people to earn lots of money. Finally we visit to our ancestor's graves together. We pack up the food that we set the table for ancestors before we depart. After we get to our ancestor's graves we set the food in front of their grave or monument and we bow to our ancestor again like we did in the morning. Sometimes we cut the grass around the grave. The New Year's Day is to treat our ancestors and to pray for a good harvest and fortune in New Year. It is a really nice opportunity to know about Korean culture and I am already looking forward to the next New Year's Day.
