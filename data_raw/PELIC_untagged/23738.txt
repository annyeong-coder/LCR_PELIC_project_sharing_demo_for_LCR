My food experiences in America been like interesting experience . My best food experience in America is cabbage pasta with butter corn cake and potato soup. It is so delicious that I had never experienced before I came to the US. I do not think it is true that Americans cannot cook even if they depend on convenience and fast food may be the adults nowadays do not know cooking basics but this does not mean they do not know how to cook . I do not know their names but I tried those dishes from Americans who can really cook.
