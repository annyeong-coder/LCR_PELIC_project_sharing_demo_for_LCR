Happiness is a very important thing in our life that we spend a lot of effort to get some of it. If you want to become happier be sure to remember many things. In my opinion happiness can enrich through enhancing your health building strong relationships with your family and friends and visiting new countries. Initially the most important thing is enhancing your health. Since you're healthy person you get all kinds of happiness. For instance several people around the world have different kinds of disease or sicknesses such as stress high blood pressure diabetes and other types of disease. When you're a healthy person you don't have any kinds of diseases so you're glad. You can enjoy your time by eating drinking playing talking and traveling. When you feel sad you can visit some patients in the hospital to see the difference between you and them. Secondly a family and loyal friends cooperate to help you become happy. In fact parents love their sons and daughters and they support them no matter what. As a result you get a lot of care from your parents. Enjoy your time by hanging out with your parents. In other words take your parents on a picnic and prepare food to eat together and have a lot of fun. Talking with them about any things bothering you consequently they help you with the possible methods and way to fix it. Lastly every country can be distinguished from another so you can discover and understand a new country that you didn't visit before. Obviously some times everyone feels bored from the place they live so you can change your mood by visiting new countries relax and release anxiety or apprehension. You can learn and benefit from new customs food cooking and culture. All in all the happiness feel you can come from different things in your life. Develop your health to become happier. Enjoy the time you spend with your family and friends. Going to visit new countries and doing new things in your life.
