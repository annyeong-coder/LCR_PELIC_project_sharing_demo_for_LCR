Mr. Zhou Enlai 1898 1976 who is considered to be the greatest prime minister of China is the person I admire. Mr. Zhou was born at Jiangsu province which is located east of China. After graduated from Nankai University he went to France for working and studying. In Paris he was believed to be one of the most outstanding Chinese students in France. After finished the studying in France he went back to China and took part in the revolution. During the war of resistance against Japan he and Mr. Mao Zedong were both regarded as the leaders of Chinese Communist Party. After the foundation of People's Republic of China he was elected to be the first prime minister of the new government. As prime minister of China Mr. Zhou Enlai worked very hard. Meanwhile he is also thought to be very frugal to himself but bountiful to common people. It was said that once a worker's shirt was torn by Mr. Zhou's car. He immediately gave that worker money and asked him to buy a new one. Though he had had only one shirt about 20 years he still did not to buy a new one until death made him leave his people. Anyway it has been proved that Mr. Zhou Enlai really is our people's good prime minister.
