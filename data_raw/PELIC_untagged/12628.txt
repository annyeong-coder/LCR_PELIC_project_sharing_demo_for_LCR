Topic the importance of developing alternative energy sources Developing alternative energy sources is the important current task for us. The gas price is skyrocketing all over the world for example the Japan's gas rate is 6 dollars per gallon. People used to believe that the gas was an eternal energy source without a proof but it was a fake theory. In fact we nearly run out of it. We've already known alternative energy sources such as this for energy made from nuclear biotechnology natural and etc. Each source has advantages and disadvantages. First the nuclear source provides large amount of power for us. But it contains high risk side effects like an explosion and accelerating global warming. Second the bio energy market is getting larger. The bio energy is made from corns and another specific food. It seems to be practical. But crop products aren't enough to convert into fuel as much as we require. Some parts of Africa lack of food attribute to making the bio energy. In contrast the natural sources such as wind sun and water are called clean energy. Those energies construct of the natural and the technology. However acquiring those power relies on weather. We need to develop the way how to obtain them. For another example one scientist fuelled hydrogen for vehicle instead of the gas for a long time ago. It worked but there were lots of problems for practical. Thus the technology has reached creating new fuels. I think that we won't be stuck in the tricky alternative energy issue because the technologies have been improving.
