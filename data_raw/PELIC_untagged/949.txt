Last semester which was my first semester of studying English in the U. S I joined in a ELI trip which had 3 days and 2 nights vocation in Philadelphia. There were 7 people Peter who was my reading teacher and the ELI activity advisor also Mohamand and Saowu who are Saudi Arabians Jay Emily who come from Taiwan and me. The first day we started the trip at 8 00 AM on July first. All of us were excited and expected the trip. We had ridden for 6 hours before we arrived the hotel. After we checked in we went to Dinner and had our early dinner. In the Dinner Peter taught us the names of different dressings that we hadn't known. He asked the waitress to give us four kinds of dressings and got us to remember. It was so funny wasn't it After finishing our dinner we walked to the port which had fireworks show at that night. While we were waiting for the fireworks we bought popsicles which had different shape. Mine was a Snoopy's head. Then we saw and enjoyed the show. Second day we visited the Liberty Bell which is a famous symbol in the history of the U. S we rode a horse cab also we took the subway which I had never tried in the U. S. At night we had dinner at an Afghanistan restaurant which had exactly special food. After going back to the hotel we had a small party which with beer and snacks. Hsinni brought a big backpack which was full of snacks! Third day which was the last day of the trip we had our free time thus we decided to take action seperately. Emily and I visited Independence Hall which is the prominent building in Philly. At 1 00 PM we left for Pittsburgh and finished the trip which was novelty and funny!
