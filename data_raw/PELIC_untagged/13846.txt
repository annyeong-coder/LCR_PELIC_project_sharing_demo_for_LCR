On one hand I think competition may hinder young age children because when they do work they think that they are the best and if you give a prize for just one child and left the others with out a prize that will be frustrating for these children. On the other hand older children should be put under competiton to do there best. I have two nephews one someone do good thing I give him agift the other one really become frustrated.
