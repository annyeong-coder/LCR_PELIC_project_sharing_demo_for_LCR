On Tuesday 12 2008 I had the worst meal ever after finishing the work with my teacher at the William Pitt Union whish was doing Valentines cards. I went with my friends to Panera to have coffee however I was really hungry and decided to eat. I had chicken sandwich contained tomato red onion and lettuce. The sandwich was cold and the chicken was not really cooked. Also I had a can of Peps for drink and it was not cold as I thought. In the end for desert I had a bag of chips and cup of tea. The tea was good but the chips were fresh I needed to put tow spoons of salt on it. I had a very bad dinner on that day and I would never go there again.
