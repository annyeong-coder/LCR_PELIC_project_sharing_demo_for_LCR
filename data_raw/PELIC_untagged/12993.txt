When I graduated from the high school I decided to go to the national guard academic but they didn't accept me. I don't know why I think because I was skinny. Howeve I went to united state to study in the university that was my father advise. Well I had to learn english languge before I get to the university. I was studing in the ELS languge centers. I started with 101 level that was for the begginers. I was living in the dorm also I had a lot of friends there. There were a nice teachers and my favorite teacher is Amanda she was the best teacher there. I decided to go to pitt university finally I will be in the university next term if I got the acceptance from the university.
