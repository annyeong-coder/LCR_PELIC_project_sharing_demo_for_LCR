Six years ago my brothers and I lived with my parents in Taichung but now we have lived in different countries. We raised the first dog named Danny in 2007 but now have had three dogs in my house. My brothers and I studied in the same school in 2005 but now we all have studied in different places. My father worked in the local government one year ago but now he has had his own business.
