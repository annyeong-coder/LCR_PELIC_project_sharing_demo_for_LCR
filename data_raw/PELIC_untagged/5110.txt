I have been dancing since I was four years old. My mom told me that one time we went to a party and I started to dance alone in the dance floor and everybody was astonished of my talent to dance. At first I began taking class of ballet and Flamenco in my elementary school. After a while I attended special events that they were done by students. In 1983 my parents didn't have enough money and they couldn't pay my dance school anymore. After that I started a free course and I could to keep me practicing. Then when I finished my high school I got a job and I couldn't continue with my course. Lately I have participated in some small events in my country but to me it hasn't been enough. Since then I have been frustrated about my favorite hobby but hopefully I have been practicing dancing in my house with my friends and on the street because I haven't wanted to lose my talent and because dancing makes me feel alive and happy.
