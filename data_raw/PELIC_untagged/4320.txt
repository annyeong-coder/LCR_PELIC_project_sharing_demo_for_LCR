Global warming is the primary problem around the world. Unusual weather reminds human beings to be concerned about our earth. Are you worried about this crisis Even if you do not concerned about this crisis you still have to be responsible for your earth. We can avoid getting worse and retrieve our earth if only everyone in the world can do something good for the earth right away. First of all we can decide to take transportation to everywhere instead of driving our own car therefore we can reduce the using of gasoline. Secondly we consider using higher price but efficient light bulbs to save consumption of energy. If we want to do more practicable governments should force constructers to use green bulbs. Green bulbs not only have longer life span but also produce less carbon dioxide. Last but not the least scientists should keep investigating new green energy resources and new implements. New energy resources will have replaced fossil fuels and new implements can produce less pollution. We can do more than what we discuss above.
