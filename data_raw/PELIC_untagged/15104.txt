Good afternoon!everyone. The most important person that I met was in my high school. He was my teacher. He name is LuJian. To be honest when I was a high school student. I was very shy. I am afraid of communicate with other peoples. However he know me that personality. Then he try him best to help me. Everyday after class he will accompany with me to finished my homework and required me to talk to him. Just practise to tlke to other people. No matter what kind of mistake I have. He never laught me. He just encourage me to do it again. It's really help me a lot.
