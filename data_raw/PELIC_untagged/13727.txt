I watched a movie last saturday. The movie made in Korea is very famous in Korea. It is a real life story described about handball players. In Korea some of sports baseball soccer basketball are very famous so that players can make a lot of money. However some of sports handball swimming volleyball etc. Is turned away by spectators. A result of Olympiad the most famous sports event in the world was very good but they can not make money. In the story many handball teams suffering from a huge deficit broke up in Korea so they handball players lost their job. Even though many players gave up player life some of players made handball team not having any sponsors. They trained very hard and they got silver medal at 2002 Sydney Olympiad. After this happening more people visit handball game. Handball team could get the sponsor very big companies. This story give us a lesson when we have any problem we should not give up.
