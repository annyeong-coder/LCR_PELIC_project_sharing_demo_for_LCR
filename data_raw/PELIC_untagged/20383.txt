First of all life will go on no matter of the way you will manage the issue. Avoid street and think logically. The key to your problem is how you can convince your parents that you will be safe and happy because I believe that is what they mainly concern convince your parents you may do one of the following solutions Invite them to visit you in US or have your friend Jim to visit them in Japan if they see him they may change their mind when they know how much he loves you. Another different way ask your parents will they accept it if he will go to live with you in Japan And if he loves you then he will do that. After all if non of the proposed solutions worked I am sure that the best for you is to obey your parents and you will find another Jim and may be even better the same way you found him which wasn't expect but you can not find another parents never.
