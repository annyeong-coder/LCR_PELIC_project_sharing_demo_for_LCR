Banality of evil literally indicates the ordinariness of evil. This is strange phrase because of the fact that evil should not be ordinary. Ordinary people might commit harsh destructive actions without notice of that. I think most people will do that as the article stated out of their sense of obligation. I don't think such person has hostility or aggressive tendencies but most of them did really carry on the experiment. What were they afraid of anyway it was only an experiment! How about other situations in daily real life Isn't there a little rational thinking at all There is one significant question to ask does authority have this serious impact on us
