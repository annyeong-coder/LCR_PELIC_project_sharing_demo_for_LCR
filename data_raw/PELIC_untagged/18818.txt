There are many things I learn in this semester. First I improve my English. Second I known a lot of friends from different countries. Other I learned more about Pittsburgh. I feel I did big achievements. Next now I can speak English with any one and I do not wary about doing any mistakes. The good thing that I learned a lot of methods of teaching that I can use when I go back. I learned more than I was hope. I think one paragraph is not enough to cover all things that I learned in this wonderful city. I learned a lot form being student in E L I . I met with a lot student from different palaces. The good thing that I learned all the people whom I met were very nice. From my point of view all people over the world have the same idea about how the world is And how the world should bee.
