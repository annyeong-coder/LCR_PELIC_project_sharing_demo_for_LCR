Hi Tammar. Did you spent a wonderful holiday I spent my whole holiday with my family. Monday was the best. Early in the morning we went to picnic. We went to Morain Park to ride a bicycle to see a beautiful fall foliage. The fee for bicycle riding was expensive. We laid out 35. Although it was expensive it was worth to pay. I have never seen this beautiful roads like there. Yellow red green and orange colors together did the scene up. We really played around! It was little bit difficult to keep some distance away while riding bicycle together. My younger brother keep up to be at the first. So that solved a bicycle jam between our 5 family members. All of our family members felt having a hard work out that morning. After 1 hour for riding we drop by outlet mall nearby the park to pick some winter clothes up. We also had a great time in there too. Shopping is always enjoyable. I strongly recommend you to go Morain Park too. See you soon. Bye. Scencerely ANON_NAME_0
