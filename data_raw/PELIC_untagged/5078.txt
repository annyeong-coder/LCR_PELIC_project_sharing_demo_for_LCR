Her advice Don't tell little white lies I think is great one depending on the optimistic aim for using the online dating. And that is easy for responsible honest and peace people. On the other hand her advice Do spend time getting to know someone online in my opinion I think isn't work sometime than actual meeting and talk face to face because I believe for eyes language is fast understand and achieve more than use online for a long time.
