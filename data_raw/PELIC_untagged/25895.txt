A soulmate is someone who takes responsibilities in relationships. My soulmate lives in Pittsburgh where we both spend a lot of nice times. Sometimes we meet at the restaurant which is a cross the street from library. My soulmate is someone whose friends are important to him and to whom everyone can trust. My soulmate is someone that never forgets my birthday.
