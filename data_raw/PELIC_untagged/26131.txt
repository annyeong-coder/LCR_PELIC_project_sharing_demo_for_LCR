My goal is to get a high grade in the TOFEL or ILETS test. Eventhough I didn't get a good grade in the first time I will never give up. Since I finished the first test I decided to take a course for the test. Getting moderate score I tought about taking the test again. While I was taking the test I felt sad about the difficult of the questions. Despite the fact that I studed English I didn't do well. Being upset as it my first time make me get a low grade. But I will never give up and I will try my best next times.
