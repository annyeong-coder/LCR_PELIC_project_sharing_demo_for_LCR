Last year I wanted to do tourism in my country and visit some famous city. So I looked up some information by internet and I found two options Merida and Barquisimeto. Both of them are very beautiful and it was so hard make a decision. I analyzed the similarities and differences between the two cities that I could finally come to my decision to visit to Merida. Merida and Barquisimeto have a lot of similarities. First of fall Merida has food as delicious as Barquisimeto and I could find this food in wherever place. Second the nature in Merida is very similar to Barquisimeto. They have many mountains and a lot of green and flowers. After I evaluated the similarities I took my time to think about the differences between Merida and Barquisimeto and I realized that there were many importance things. The weather in Merida is more comfortable than Barquisimeto because is colder and less sticky. Also the population in Merida is funnier than Barquisimeto and definitely I wanted to go to spend a great time and this was a good argument. Finally Barquisimeto is more expensive than Merida. Food transportation and lodging is very expensive and I did not have enough money. In Conclusion after I considered all these things I made were very important to me. I wanted to tell you that was a nice vacation and I had very good experience.
