In De throned English language is dominant in all over the world and it is a key in politics economies and medias. However in Co star English language is the most important language but it is not likely to be dominant. In De throned Russian and Arabic are more spoken in their countries. However in Co star Chinese is the most spoken language and Arabic Hindi and Spanish are increasing. In De throned the minority languages are being killed but in Co star it is a major contribution of bilingual and multilingual. From my perspective Co star is the most convincing because it relies on statistics and more closer to the fact
