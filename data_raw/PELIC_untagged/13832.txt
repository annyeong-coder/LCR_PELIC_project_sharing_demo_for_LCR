I had a unforgotable experience about the telephone. In the summer vocation I try my best to contact a friend from my hingh school. When I hold on the phone. I don't remeber her number clearly. So I check the book want figure out the number. I had try . But still not work on. So I feel a litter bit want to give up. But I insit on. Just pick up the phone again. Hold on the phone waiting her talk into the conversation. But just now a strange voice talk to me . I don't who is it. It give me a lot of advertisement from it. I just listen . No word I said. A few minutes later I still don't understand what they want to expression. So I end up the talking . . . It's boring.
