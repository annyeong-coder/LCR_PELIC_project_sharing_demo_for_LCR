Friday and Sunday Most people enjoy their weekend days because they get tired of working within the whole week. Therefore they try to plan for it to have fun and enjoy their time. Actually weekend days are different between Saudi Arabia and the United States but my philosophy about weekend days have not changed. The weekend starts in Friday and ends with Sunday and these days have many similarities but they also have some differences. In my country I was enjoying my weekend days which were Thursday and Friday and when I came to the United States I hear this expression TGIF which means thank God it's Friday. In fact Friday is considered for most people the best day in weekend because they are free from work for the next 2 days. Therefore people are celebrating this day by making parties either indoor parties or outdoor parties. In the other hand Sunday is the last day in weekend and workers should sleep early to be ready for work therefore they do not make parties in Sunday. Friday and Sunday are unique because both of them make people happy. People can sleep well in these days and they can take rest to relieve their stress. Also they can visit their families and give them more time to discuss their problem and telling them stories about their week. In conclusion Friday and Sunday are within weekend days and people like them because they are off from work and because they can sleep well. In the other hand parties are seen only on Friday because they have more time to spend with friends.
