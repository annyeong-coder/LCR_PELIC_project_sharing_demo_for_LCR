A view from my window When I look out of my window first thing that I always see is grasses. Then there are many kind of flowers. First there are two different types of roses one huge pine tree after there is a little space right next to the pine tree and that space is for my mother's tomatoes peppers and the last vegetable basil. Afterward there is a small garden door from home to the garden. Finally when you walk from small stairs dawn to the other door you will see the other door to get out of the garden.
