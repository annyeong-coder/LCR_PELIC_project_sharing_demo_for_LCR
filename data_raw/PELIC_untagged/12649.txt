All my neighbors are laud and therefore my neighborhood is not quiet especially in the moments of classes. If I was not going to school I would not live in an apartment because apartments are too tied. I like living in a large house because a house is isolated and independent . The type of neighborhood I will choose the live in is a suburban area because it is not violent and it is protected it is widely accepted by many people.
