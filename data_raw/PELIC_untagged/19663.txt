Researchers at the university of Pittsburgh cancer institute have developed a way to predict which patient will respond to certain chemotherapies by measuring a biomarker . Also their findings published by the American Association for cancer research Furthermore according to senior author Niedernhofer professor in the school of Medicine states that identification of molecular maker is extremely important and her team examined the role of ERCC1 XPF an enzyme in DNA repair which it could work against damaging the DNA from chemotherapies . Additionally the chemotherapies are toxic so this can help to choose which alternative treatments will work. Finally the current method of measuring the enzyme isn't accurate yet and the researchers determined that it's protein levels vary from tumour to another the author also developed the first strong method to approach the identification of biomarkers to determine which patient might benefit from certain chemotherapies.
