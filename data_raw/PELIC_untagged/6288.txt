My room is clean and bright. The room always cheer me up when I come back home. I used to close a curtain to keep dust out even though the weather was nice. Furthermore I didn't hang my clothes so my room was so messy. However nowadays I figure out that to take the room away make to cheer me up. To take my room away helps me to understand more easily my studying. In the future I want to go up my house by my self after I tear down my old house so I want to catch on my career. My dream is an architect. Right now I am doing my grammar homework in my room. It gives me brainstorm.
