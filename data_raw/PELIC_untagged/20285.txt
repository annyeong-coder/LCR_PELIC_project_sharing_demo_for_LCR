I would say my framework about things I wanted to do to help for our class when I was in high school is creativity. My philosophy in school was living healthy and happy was totally different from most parents' hope of higher and higher grade. The underlying reason was that I felt many students couldn't thrive on too much pressure. I wrote a letter to my mentor and exhibited several suggestions of how to help students to get rid of stress and study more effectively. My mentor enhanced and detailed my framework of suggestions and took us playing and exercising everyday instead of just studying all alone. The effects of my suggestions were happier face and better study attitude emerged one month later. The principal noticed the change and encouraged other students to sustain to do the activities. I felt that I was compensated rather ran got ignored.
