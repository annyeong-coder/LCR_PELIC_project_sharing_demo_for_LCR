I've read the quote by ANON_NAME_0 Arbus. I think it means that she the most like is to visit places that she has never been before. On my case I have visited many places. My favorite place is Paris. Paris is an amazing town. I have been there twice. The most interesting experience that I have been seen the Monaliza at the louver museum. My best friend Karima has just returned from China she has been there for two weeks. She has visited the Great Wall. She sent me an email and asked me if I have been in China I replied an email to my friend and informed her that I have never been in China.
