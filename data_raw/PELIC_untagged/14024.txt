When I saw this question nothing about flow came up on my mind. However I noticed that I had several experiences about flow even though the concept of flow is little bit different from the concept of flow in the text book. The difference was that I experienced several times of flow for one topic. I was not a child when I experienced flow so I could not just sit for a long time and think a lot. I had to go to school meet people and do assignment. Therefore I had to go in state of flow separately in a school bus or subway and in the bed. When I was a freshman in university I had to give a presentation about the possible solutions of Korea economy slump at the end of semester. My economy professor mentioned it at the beginning of semester. It was my first project so I really wanted to do well. I always brought paper and write whatever came up in my mind. When I thought about the project time flew. Finally I got the creative solution and I gave an A speech. I could not get the creative solution at once. However I was able to get the creative idea from several flow. I believe that flow helps people think creatively even though sometimes it takes a long time.
