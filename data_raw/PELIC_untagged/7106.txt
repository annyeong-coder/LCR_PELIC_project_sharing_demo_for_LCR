1. Love your friend with her his faults. I agree with this. I have friend who is different from me. She is someone who is wishy washy and easy going whereas I am someone who is impatient and active. We became friends 10 years ago. We were in the same which middle and high schools. When we met the first time I didn't like her because she is someone who is very clever but she can be a lazy too. So she was always late for our appointments. Gradually I got used to that part of her personality. So I changed my character because of by her and I became a patient person. That was good for me. 2. One of my friends who has been living next my apartment Is Korea. My friend is someone who is friendly considerate and talkative. When we went outside to a big park near our home we used to play tennis or badminton together there. She is someone who always talked a lot and was exuberant. Also I am someone who likes cooking so I usually prepared many foods. And we often had a great time sharing meals.
