The authors link some factors to killing the creativity such as watching the kids while they're working and when teachers make them worry about assessing their works or when teachers give rewards more than they should or when kids engage in competition or when they do not have choices or when kids be under pressure. In my experience I didn't like it when teacher tell me do every thing as a child. Teachers usually have some levels that they think students should pass but as child I liked it when some teachers give me the freedom to do what I want.
