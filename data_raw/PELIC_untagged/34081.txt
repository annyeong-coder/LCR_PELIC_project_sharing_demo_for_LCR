My ideal home is big and modern. It is located in a peaceful residential area near beautiful beach. It is quite near beach therefore I can go to beach easily. It has big sunny room and high ceilings. It has large living room with very good decoration and confortable sofa. The bathroom has high technology massage bathtub. The bathroom is clearly and neatly. I have one soft and confortable king size bed in my bedroom. A lovely bedroom that I feel relaxed after a long hard day work. My home also has modern appliance and high speed Internet. It is convent drive from work and shopping center. It is in a really quite safe street and it has absolute fresh air. It has friendly and politely neighborhood. The most important thing is that it has totally sunny day over the year.
