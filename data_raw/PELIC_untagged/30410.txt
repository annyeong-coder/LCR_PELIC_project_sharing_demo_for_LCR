Choosing a name for the newborn is a requirement on every parent. Since the child is born the parents are expected to give him or her a name. Many people think that unusual names are special and unique. However I believe that unusual names could be strange on the child himself and can lead him to a harder life. Every name has an impact on his owner. If the parents chose a female sound name on a male child this may affect the child's personality. The boy might act softly according to the sound of his name Many children change their names when they get older. It is proven that a variety of people didn't feel that their names fit with their lives. And when they grow up they choose a different name. Other children face difficulties in schools because of their names. They could face teasing from other classmates on their names. Some children hate going to school and fight with their parents to stay at home. Although many people claim that there are a huge number of successful people who have unusual names. Studies shown that the percentage of people who change their strange names when they get older is higher than the people who keep it. While I agree that sometimes unusual names may give the child a sense of uniqueness. I believe that choosing a good name for the child would make his life easier.
