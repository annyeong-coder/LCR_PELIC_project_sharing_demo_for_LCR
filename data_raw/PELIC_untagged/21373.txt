In this term I achieved a lot of benefits. First of all I generally enhanced my language. This improvement which I obtained maximized my TOFEL score. Second I'm implementing what I learned like grammar and new vocabularies in my speaking that makes my speaking is not an ambiguous. Third I learned how I read fast and understand new words context implicitly. Finally this term compensated my language's weakness.
