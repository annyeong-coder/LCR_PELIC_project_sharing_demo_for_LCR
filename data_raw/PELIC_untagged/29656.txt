As you know Japan has been suffering a terrible crisis in these last weeks. A lot of American journalists have moved to the disaster area. Last night Katie Couric from CBS News reported serious damage in another reactor. She said that day by day the situation in Japan is getting worse. Also she noted that there are many workers who are sacrificing their lives trying to repair the damage in these nuclear plants. Another journalist who is in the devastated area announced that despite the fact that the Japanese government are working very hard to avoid a meltdown in these plants that still have a lot of problems. He also explained that the most serious difficulties in this case is that not many people are trained to solve this kind of problems. As you now the news from Japan is still reporting damage in these plants. For example ANON_NAME_0 Matthews who is the anchor of Hardball indicated that now there is another danger that involves plutonium. Mattews also noted that Japanese citizens have shown a real stoic spirit since they have faced this crisis with calm and bravery. That is to say despite this terrible situation the people have reacted well. But right now at the time when I am writing this report CNN is reporting that there is a high level of radiation. For this reason the US government communicated that their citizens should stay 50 miles from the affected area.
