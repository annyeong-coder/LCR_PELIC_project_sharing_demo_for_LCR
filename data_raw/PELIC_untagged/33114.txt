One day on my way home I saw a dead mouse's body. It was killed by something like traces of poison and was placed on the pavement. It was even ignored by passers by. It was regarded as a horrible thing by me so it was stepped on by my feet. I was intimidated by the dirty body and was confounded that why there's no one who want to discard it. I was surprised by the scene. My roommates were shocked by my embellished account of what happened and was frightened to dare not to go that way never!
