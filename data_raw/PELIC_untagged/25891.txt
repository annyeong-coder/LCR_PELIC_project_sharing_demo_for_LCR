I think this is an important matter in American culture. I am not certain if in the past years families were accustomed to cooking and eating at home. But since I have been here I have noticed that fast food is all over the country. I think this is happening because most parents work and they cannot spend too much time cooking. I am in favor of healthy food and home cooked food as well. If we eat this kind of food we can be less expose to health problems. According to the lecture most of the time in American culture parents bring home only fast food and I think a diet based on this type of food can lead to health problems. I think American families should redirect their interests in how to cook and pass on to the next generations. I think eat home cooked food is benefitial to our health.
