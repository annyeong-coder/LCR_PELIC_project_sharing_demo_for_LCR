Yesterday when I was in school I was preoccupied about the University of Pittsburgh requirements for graduate school. I contacted them in advanced and they said I need to fill out a form for the registration also I need a statement of purpose letter and they need any financial guarantee letter that shows financial ability. I arrived home at 4 30 pm there was a missed call from Saudi Arabia. I called the number back it was my friend told me that she just get engaged. I asked her what kind of gift she likes she replied either an expensive purse or dress. Actually she got married by a traditional marriage not by a love story. In fact I strongly agree with her since love will not stay forever. On the other hand we plan to go back home after finishing this semester. I took a pinnacle and a sheet of paper then started writing what should I take and what should not. Eventually I packed some of my luggage while my sister keeps postponing.
