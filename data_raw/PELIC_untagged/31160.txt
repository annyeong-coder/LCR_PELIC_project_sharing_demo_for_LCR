Women driving ban in Saudi Arabia Some people in Saudi Arabia want the government to give its permission for women to drive. But I completely don't agree with them. Because the women in Saudi Arabia are benefited from that decision. They don't have to do what men do. They called for equality between men and women. But I think its impossible to do a full equality. Also In my opinion if we want to help women in that issue the government should improve the public transportation and make more services for women .
