Variety is the spice of life In daily life variety is usually the spice of our life. When I continuously work hard for a long time and finished the work exactly I should have a vacation together with my family or my good friends in beach. When I research a project and come up against a little trouble I should have a cup of coffee and enjoy a wonderful music. At the Saint Valentine's Day I must send a dozen red roses to my wife. If I live in a house I should always lay a few flowers in every room. I have a child I am his father. But I may be his brother and may be his friend too. In these occasions I and my child are extremely happy. Of course I must have friends. When the friends come to my home it is my pleasure to entertain them at good dinner. If I should win a Powerball prize I would be a crazy man. Ha ha I enjoy all kinds of variety.
