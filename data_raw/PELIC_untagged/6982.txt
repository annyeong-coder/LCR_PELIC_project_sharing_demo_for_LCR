First of all I think I will continue to stay in America for 2 or 3 weeks. During those weeks I could go shopping and buy some souvenirs for my family. Second when I go back to Taiwan I might go to school to continue my research. But I may not do this because I may go to be an army first maybe. In Taiwan if you are a man when you are 18 years old you should go to be an army. This is our country's law. And now I am a student too. So I don't have to go to be an army first. But I can choose if I want to or not. Finally before I go to be an army I will have a vacation with my girlfriend. We are going to a beautiful beach in the south of Taiwan. There is the most popular place for summer vacation in Taiwan. And I wish I could have fun there before being an army.
