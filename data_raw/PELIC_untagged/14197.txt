I have new friends whose countries are different from each other after coming to the U. S. One of my friends who cannot eat the pork introduced me the person who does not eat the beef and whose girl friend does not eat the chicken last week. I am planning to have a party with them this weekend but I have a problem which will decide whether the party will be fun or not. The problem is what the dinner is best. I asked another friend who does not come to the party about the problem and she told me that I ask them to cook and bring the dishes which are their favorite foods by themselves. Moreover she whose job is the dinner planner also recommended me the place which is very quiet. I really appreciate for her.
