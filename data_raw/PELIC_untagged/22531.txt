She is a famous percussionist. She has been lost her hearing since she was 12 years old. She never gives up even though she cannot hear. She performs in about 40 different countries and tries to create percussion instruments from unusual materials. She concentrates on her music. I feel Glennie likes Helene Grimaud. They own unique music capability but the same time they are also good at the other thing such as Glennie designs and sells her own percussion instruments and loves painting drawing and exploring antique stores and Grimaud edits her own recordings and keeps wolves. Grimaud's energy explodes in performances of stunning beauty and depth that dazzle her audiences. Glennie also wants people to focus on her music and she wants them to be entertained. I like about the artist's music because she make music beautiful and she wants people to be entertained. She learns to play percussion very hard so that becomes a solo percussionist.
