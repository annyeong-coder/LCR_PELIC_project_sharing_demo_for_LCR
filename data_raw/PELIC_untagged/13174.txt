After a hard and long day with scuba diving Cathy decided to fly home home instead of driving in order to save time. Her plane engine stopped and that forced her to land on the surface of the ocean. She had to swim in a frigid water for a long distance to reach the shore. She finally reached her destination but she was exhausted and as a result she had to be in a hospital for three days.
