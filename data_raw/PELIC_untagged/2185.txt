Subject My Writing Habits I do many things before I start to write. I usually love when my study environment is clean. I prefer to study with bright light some Pencils some Papers and a computer. Also I prefer to study in the evening time. For instance I study between 8 00 and 11 00 P. M. With warm temperatures. I keep every thing away from me like TV and Radio which make me nervous. I like quiet. Also I am a tactile learner. For example I write and rewrite information. Lastly I make my favorite tea to relax. After I do these things I start writing feeling good.
