There are many kinds of food which are my favorite but a dish that I can think of when I have a chance to go to the beach or waterfall on a holiday is Som Tum or papaya salad. The ingredients of Som Tum are shreds of raw papayas chili peppers dried peppers dried beans slices of tomatoes slices of solanums pieces of long beans fish sauce palm sugar and lime juice. A recipe for Som Tum starts with putting a small bowl of shreds of raw papayas into a mortar and then puts a little bit fish sauce palm sugar chili peppers and dried peppers as well. After that mixes all of them using a pestle for a while puts the rest of the ingredients into the mortar and mixes them again. Finally serves it as a main dish and serves warm sticky rice slices of raw cabbage and pieces of raw swamp morning glory as a side dish.
