My favorite type of food is the Arabian food. My favorite dish is called Kabsa. People in my society regarded Kabsa as the main meal during the day. The Kabsa is combination of rice and meat. The rules of making Kabsa have been changed. There are different cosines of making Kabsa. I will write about my hometown's cuisine of making Kabsa. In order to prepare Kabsa you need rice meat onion tomato oil and flavors. First step is cut up one onion and tow tomatoes into small pieces. Then boil one spoon of oil. After boiling the oil saut rthe tomato and the chicken for ten minutes. After finishing cook the rice splatter toe spoons of flavors. Finally we serve it on a dish. The important thing is DON'T FORGET TO EAT IT WITH PEPSI THAT MAKES IT VERY DEALICIOUS.
