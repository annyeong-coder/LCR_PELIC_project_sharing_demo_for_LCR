By Feb. 2005 I had gotten my driver license in Alabama. I had never had a driver license before I moved to EE. UU. Before I took a test I had been studying a lot about the driving rules was not easy. By this time I hadn't studied English and the Spanish translation for the test's handbook and questions was very bad and difficult to understand. While I was practicing drive I felt sad because all the time my son had been sleeping in the back sit. By the day I had taken the test I was worried about all the directions that my husband gave me. Almost all of my friends from Argentina had failed the first time that they took a test and they knew how to drive. . . . . But I passed. . . . . After I had approved the test I felt very relief and happy.
