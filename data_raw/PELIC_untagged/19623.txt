Two months ago when I had just arrived in Pittsburgh I went to Point Park and saw a kind of little yellow canoes sailing the rivers. It sparked my interest to kayak so this weekend my boyfriend and I rented a tandem a kayak for two people and launched our adventure by the Allegheny. First I was scared because the small boat seemed very fragile in the middle of the big river but five minutes later I lost my apprehensions and began to enjoy. Eric and I had to coordinate our arms in order to row at the same time and manage the tandem after that we went along the river in direction of the current always near the riverside. Our little trip started more less by PNC stadium would finish at Point Park fountain but we were in the opposite riverbank of our goal so we had a dilemma to cross or not to cross. Finally we decided to cross as quickly as we could trying to avoid the touristic ships and motorboats that threatened our stability. It was exhausting because in this point where the 3 rivers joint each other waves are higher and more frequent. However we both thrive under pressure so we got to the other bank. After returning the kayak we went to eat a delicious vegetarian hamburger as prize for our achievement.
