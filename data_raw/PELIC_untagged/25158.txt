I have seen Avatar. Avatar directed by James Cameron is an epic science fiction movie. The movie is set in the future in the year 2154. In this movie the people of earth want to mine the most valuable natural resource called unobtanium which is in Pandora. Pandora is inhabited by the Navi blue skinned people. The people of earth try to make a connection with the Navi to mine in their residence. So Jake Sully played by actor Sam Worthington goes to Pandora as a male Navi to learn about the Navi. He meets Neytiri Zoe Saldana a female Navi when she saves him from attacking wildlife. They become close and eventually fall in love. After 6 months the people of earth begin to destroy Pandora to mine unobtanium they also attack the tribe of the Navi. So war is started between the people of earth and the Navi.
