I have many friends who are living in Thailand which is my home town. Some of them whose occupation are programmers which have a duty to create software. They spend a lot of time to do their job. However they usually have time to hang out with other friends. One of them whose name is Oil is my best friend. She usually hangs out with me and she often consults me about her boyfriend who I have never seen. We can talk to each other in every story. Even if I am in Pittsburgh we still talk to each other by phone.
