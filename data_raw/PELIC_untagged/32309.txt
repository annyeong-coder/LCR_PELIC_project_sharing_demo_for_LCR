A style of life is different from country to another country and each family has own system depends on the responsibilities of man and woman toward the children. Some people said that men are better parents than women. In my opinion the women are better parents for the children than men. First the time that woman stay with her child more than that with man. The man usually goes outside the house to work. In that all time the woman takes care and deals with her child for a long time. Second because of this child is like a part of this woman that means she will be more carefully dealing with the child than the man and she can feel exactly what the child feels. In the end men and women can be good parents for children but in my opinion the men do not have the time and patience to give to the children.
