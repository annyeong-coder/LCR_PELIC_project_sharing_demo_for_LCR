1 We are moving to a new city next semester. So I am worried about selling our furniture. 2 In the new city I am worried about how fast we can find an accommodation and buy new furniture. 3 I have an acceptance from a university. And I would like to finish my procedures as soon as possible. 4 I am planning to book a flight to go back home during Ramandan. 5 I am looking to have my lunch in McDonalds. 6 I want to buy gifts for my family.
