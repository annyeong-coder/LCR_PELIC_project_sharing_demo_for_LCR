I have been studying this semester for one month. So far I have learned simple past presrnt prefect past continue and phrase verb. I haven't learned the furture tense yet. Simple past tense is not too complex to me so I have done it well. But I feel phrase verb is a big challenge for me and I haven't known it very well. I need more and more practice. I wish I can do everything well in this semester.
