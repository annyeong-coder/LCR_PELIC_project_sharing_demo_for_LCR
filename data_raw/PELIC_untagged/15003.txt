My Room My bedroom is a nice room . Like any room in my house but it is little bid different . When you come in it you will see big flower vase next to door of my room . Then if you look at a wall you'll see a clock on it . Beside the clock is my grandfather's picture under the picture is my desk my computer is a clothespress . Front of my bed a table many kind of wax light . When you open my book case you will find in it many kind of books . I proud my room because if someone visit me usually he says nice room .
