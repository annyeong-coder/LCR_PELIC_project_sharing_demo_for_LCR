Widely used languages will be the most important languages in the world as well as English. Multilingualism is becoming more and more common in the United States. In fact according to the report of the Census Bureau last year nearly one American in five speaks a language other than English at home. Whereas the number of native English speakers is decreasing the multilingual population is increasing consequently widely used languages will be more equal to English in the future.
