Downloading from the Internet Have you ever download anything on the Internet This topic is getting increasingly significant owing to more and more authors or publishers put their articles on it yet are copied by others easily. Some people may think it is illegal to do so while other may think it is appropriate to download some of them. I have developed my own point of view as well. It is my contention that people should never download any kind of files with copyright on the Internet.
