I'm living in an apartment on Forward Ave it's not an old apartment but it's not new either. When I first moved in there weren't any furniture and nothing was hanged up on the walls. At first there were some holes in the walls so I tried to cover them up with some pictures. I also picked some furniture's up to occupied the empty space. I bought new lamps to lighten up the bedroom and living room. I throw away the old blinds in the bedroom and replaced them with new ones. I turned the air conditioner on to give the apartment new and fresh air.
