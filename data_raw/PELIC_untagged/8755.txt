A friend is a one who can help you when you have a trouble or need to help. For example in the end of July I came to Pittsburgh and met my friend Ivan who is a graduate student of Information Science at University of Pittsburgh. Meanwhile I also knew another student James who is also a graduate student and his computer skills which are including programs calculates and data structure are very great. When I moved into a new apartment where locates at centre Ave in Shadyside area they helped me to move in and out in several times within one day. I really appreciated their help so I decided to invite them to eat dinner with together. Of course I also invited them to my new apartment after setting up my furniture.
