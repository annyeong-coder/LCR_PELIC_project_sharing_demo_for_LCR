I used to live in Taiwan with my parents. I just graduated from my high school. I always felt lazy to study English. Which the weather in my country usually are worm or hot so I always ware short cloth and short pants in every season. I used to drive the car or ride motorcycle with my friends we used to play outside all the day. Today I am living in Pittsburgh with my aunt uncle and my little cousin. I attending University of Pittsburgh ELI program. Now I wearing heavy clothes the weather is cooler than my country. I go anywhere by bus and every week day I go to school to study And now I'm studying English harder than while I was in Taiwan.
