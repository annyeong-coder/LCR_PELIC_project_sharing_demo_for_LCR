My friend Amy is a shy girl who likes to drink coffee. She almost drinks coffee every morning but sometimes she has a little trouble. If she spills coffee all over her dress she will say the stain looks like flowers. If I laugh at her she will give me a shy but cute smile. She is always an optimist.
