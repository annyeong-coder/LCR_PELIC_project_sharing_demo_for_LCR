A friend in need is a friend indeed. It is as if was written for Ramazan who is my best friend in life. In my opinion a best friend is someone who helps you when you are in trouble and who listens to your problem. I met Ramazan in 1992 while we were waiting in the university registration line. I enjoyed Ramazan from the beginning and we shared a small apartment which had only one bedroom until we graduated from the university. In this period we shared a lot of things most of which were very secret. Ramazan who explained to me his private feelings and thoughts without hesitation was my confidant. Ramazan who was very sensitive and supportive helped me with everything in this period. When I needed to decide on something I consulted Ramazan and I shared my opinions with him because he was very insightful person. When we attended university my schedule was very hard and generally I came home after 8 o clock. Also I attended some courses every Saturday. At this period Ramazan helped my homework and household duties. Ramazan who understood me easily provided immeasurable help for my achievements. As long as I live I won't forget him.
