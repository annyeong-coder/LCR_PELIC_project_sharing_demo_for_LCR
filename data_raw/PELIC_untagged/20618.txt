I will take a compass with me to know the Directions and where is the site on the planet. I will take the fishing tools so I can catch fish from the ocean to eat. I will take the Lighter for heating and cooking food. I am going to take some food ready to eat to help me to find some time. I am going to pick up some fireworks so I can draw the attention of passing ships.
