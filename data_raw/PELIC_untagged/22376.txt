Hi I'm cheick. I have been building a site called sky blog for about 8 months. I have created this blog to put my weekly picture for my family. I have loved soccer since I was a kid. I have been going to a soccer field for about 5 months In Pittsburgh. Even last week I was there playing as a striker and I scored two goals. After we finished playing I met a guy who knows my best friend and we spoke for 3 hours and ended up with dinner together.
