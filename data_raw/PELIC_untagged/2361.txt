The Last Moment in Riyadh indent Everyone in this world has some experience he never forgets. I really never forgetting how my emotion was when I decided to travel from Riyadh to the U. S for study. A week before I came here I had felt a mix of emotions when I said good bye to my friends and my relatives. It was a hard situation but I handled it very well. Some times I was sad to leaving my home and some times I was very comfortable and happy for my dream which getting a master degree from the U. S. While I was moving from place to place in Riyadh to complete my documents and some of my business before I traveled I was thinking about risks that I must have demitted from my work and go away from my family and friends. In addition it would be the longest period of time I must have been away from my home. Is it going to be a good chance for me or not What about my future after I will return from the U. S Many questions were circling in my mind! It was a very tough moment! It was a time to say good bye to my parents and my siblings then go to the airport. I can't express or explain that last moment before I went to the airport. I hugged my mother with warm feeling and I kissed her hands that have been caring me for a long time. Also I kissed my father's head while he was murmuring the last good advice to me. Then I faced my siblings down stairs in my family's house and they presented some gifts to me sadly. When we arrived in the airport I was forced myself to arrange our luggage and take our seats in an airplane. Finally when the airplane took off I had to eliminate all emotions and feelings that disturbed me to complete my successful story. However we can't forget the best experiences in our life.
