My initial experience involved a problem in cross cultural communication is talking with senior person like a teacher or boss in English. Because I spoke polite word when I talked them in Japan. But English doesn't have polite word such as Japanese so I speak same word to friends and senior person in English. First time I thought that it was rude behavior. But I'd need to study hader if English was more complicated rule than now. Next talk about an ethnic food. There are vary toraditional food in my hometown. For example I like raw horse meet. I think that it's kind of bizarre food for American. It seems like raw fish. Of cource you can't see any blood. It smells little strange just like ram meet. Color is red or pink or white and red which is depend on part of muscle. If you cooked it it would become hard that you couldn't chew it. It sounds weird but it tastes really good and it has low calorie. Many gestures feel frustration when communicate with others. I think that we should read some guide books before visit orher countries. It will be helpful to realize unique culture custom and manner. I bring a pen and peace of paper and I'll write word down on it or drowing picture on it when I'm in a trouble during I have conversation.
