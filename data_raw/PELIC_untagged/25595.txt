I live in a house. I have two roommates and get along with two lovely cats. My room is fitness to living. At the beginning my room is empty out. But my roommates and me work out together and we find out the problem. We decide to pick up a new bookcase and a new desk to fill my room up. I started to fix my room up I was doing several things to change my room. I'm going to take the curtains down that will light my room up. Our two cats can lie down on the windowsill and enjoy the wind and sunshine. My room become bright and sunny now. I clean up my room once a week and I use music alert to wake me up every day. Everything in my room always cheer me up every day. I will keep on to make my home better. I really enjoy to stay in my home.
