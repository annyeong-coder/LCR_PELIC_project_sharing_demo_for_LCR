I came to Pittsburgh to study English and Flute. I have been in here almost two months. While I am living here I found differences and similarities between Japan and United States of America in eating habits and social life. First there are some differences and similarities in eating habits. We usually say Itadakimasu before we eat every meals. This mean is we appreciate that we will be able to eat the lives of meal . And the end of every meal we say Gochisousamadesita . It means It was very delicious . If we didn't feel the meal was tasty we have to say that. It is a kind of custom of Japan. Instead of Japan I haven't heard that kind of greeting in U. S. A. But some people prays for god before eating. And there is also difference of food between Japan and U. S. A. The taste of almost all Japanese food are thinner than American foods. When I ate American cake I was so surprised. Because they are too sweet for me. I have never eaten so much sweet thing like the cake before!I found some differences of food but I also found some similarities MacDonald's and Japanese food restaurants. Each of them are also very popular in Japan. So I do know well about them. Second I found some differences and similarities in social life in America and Japan.
