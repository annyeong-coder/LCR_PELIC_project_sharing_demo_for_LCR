There is a famous fairly tale The boy who cried wolf . In the original story the boy who is a sheepherder lies to the village when he shouts Wolfs are coming . The villagers worry about him and try to save him. However when the villagers come they find WHAT HE SAID was a lie. After he did the trick several times the villagers never believe WHAT HE SAYS. After all he is eaten by wolfs when wolfs really attack the boy. Here is a parody of The boy who cried wolf written by a Japanese writer. Until almost the end the story runs in the same way with the original one. However the ending is different and very humorous. The sheepherder boy is actually very smart so he predicts THAT THE VILLAGERS WILL NOT BELIEVE HIM ANYMORE even if he shouts Wolfs are coming . He thinks WHAT HE SHOULD DO for a while and shouts A large troop of beautiful women is hitting me it's terrible but you should never save me! Then all men of the village come out from the houses right away. Following the men their wives who feel jealous come outside. After all he saves his life. WHAT IS FUNNY IN THIS STORY is THAT THE SMART BOY BACOMES THE CHIEF OF THE VILLAGE IN THE FUTURE AND MAKES WONDERFUL POLICIES OF THE VILLAGE. He can manipulate the villagers to work hard and the village develops incredibly. The writer of this parody warned readers THAT WE SHOULD NEVER TRY TO FOLLOW WHAT HE DOES. If an ordinary person tries that he or she will be just eaten by wolfs or be excluded because of the villager's anger.
