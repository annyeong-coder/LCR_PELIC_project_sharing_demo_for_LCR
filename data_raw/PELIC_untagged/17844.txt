Photo My last birthday There are friends who are same collage mates. There is a piece of cake which sticks candles in a birthday cake. There are three jugs of beer on the table. We used to eat dinner and drink alcohols together. When it was my birthday on October 3 2008 we had a big party at the Kangnam station which is a famous place of young people in Seoul. My left side girl who wears black one piece majored in English language and English literature she is working in Korea branch of the Mentholatum Asia Pacific. Her personality is very vivid which means an attractive woman but she is still a single. Another girl who wears a knitted silver and pink shirt majored in French language and French literature. She used to work in YSL Company of garments after wedding she quitted her office. She who has a shot hair is gorgeous and trendy. My lovely friend who has became a wife and then we could not eat out together or drink alcohols as usual. Her husband who is working at Hankook central bank of Korea is very conservative. Before 9pm she has to go home. That day which was on my birthday we drank beer a lot. Because I would go abroad on December we wanted to talk over drinking off a jug. In spite of ourselves we have drunken we couldn't stop talking. The husband who is banker was upset for us. He took my friend who is his wife home. My friend who wears a black one piece was worried about her but she would be fine. Though we have drunken also was too late we have really enjoyed talking over our life. I still miss last my birthday.
