When we compare two things some people prefer one side whereas some go with the other side. In fact there is no one is better for all people and all the time! Every single person has own comparison equation which their factors vary from person to person. However I'm going to compare between a small town and a big city what are the similarities and the differences. In fact the evolution of technology has changed the life in cities dramatically. Actually it has widened the gap between cities and small towns. When you see the big differences and almost no similarities you think cities are in a planet while towns are in another planet even there are few miles between them! One of the big advantages of living in a big city is expand your knowledge about other cultures. As Known one of the main features of cities is culture variety. You acquire how to see things from other perspectives. On the other hand living in a small town will not give an opportunity to live through this experience. In spite of living in a big city gives you many wonderful advantages it steals our values! As we mentioned before the cities are multicultural. These cultures react just like two chemical compounds which react to give a new complex that have new characters which sometimes are not related to the original compounds. Unfortunately our customs have melted in urban's oven! Our identities have become ambiguous! In contrast people living in small towns maintain their values which is still deep rooted. Their identities is very clear and strong. This priceless legacy passes down from generation to another. On other hand I feel sorry for our prospective children because their legacy has been lost!
