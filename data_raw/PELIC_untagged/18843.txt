I am moving with my family to Dallas Texas because my wife will pursue her MS at SMU University. Initially when she got the acceptance we were not sure of moving there because few people recommended that we go to the southern region. After considering many factors we finally decided to move. We are leaving this Thursday therefore I have to accomplish several things Such as getting red of my furniture making a hotel reservation securing new place to live. After I get settled there I will continue to study English on my own and I hope I will get the time to do this. The three months that I spent at ELI have helped me a lot to improve my English. Therefore I should carry on and work hard to acquire the appropriate skills that help me to pass the TOEFL exam which is my main target for the next few months.
