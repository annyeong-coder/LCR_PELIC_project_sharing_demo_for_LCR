Last week when I came back from school I was taking off my clothes and trying to turn on the TV when the phone rang. I was looking at the number to figure out who was calling me but I couldn't find out who it was. So I picked up the phone. It was a wrong number. He said I am sorry. And hung up. He called me back two more times but I didn't pick up the phone anymore.
