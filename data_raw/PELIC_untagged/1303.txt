The most interesting thing I have ever had was in 2004 while I am visiting New York city. I went to a restaurant in Manhattan with a couple of my friends we ordered a big meal and we enjoyed that meal. It is the time to pay we told the waiter to divid the bill. Each one of us payed his bill separately. Suddenly before we left the restaurant we realized we did not tipped the waiter. We decided to go back and give him a tip. But before we reached him he started to look at us in a very bad way. Also a lot of the waitress were staring at us. Before he start to talk we told him we are sorry about this miss under standing. We gave him most of the money we were holding to satisfy him. Because we know if we do not satisfy him next if we decide to visit that restaurant he will deal with us in a rude way.
