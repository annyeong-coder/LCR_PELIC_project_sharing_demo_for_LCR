I will writ about marathoner. He is from Korea his name is BongJu ANON_NAME_0. He got a silver medalist of Atlanta Olympic in 1994 years and the first rank of Boston Marathon in 2001 years. You may know that marathoners have to run for a long time and fight oneself. It's very hard. Indeed when hi was born he naturally has a flatfoot. People who have a flatfoot are very hard to run. Also his eyes are different with other eyes. For example normally during the running there is mush sweat on the face. But eyebrows can protect that water enter the eyes. But his eyebrows couldn't protect that. So while he is running he has to sweat away. But now he is success. He is 37years old but he still is best marathoner in the world. He is able to run now.
