The Spanish writer Jacinto Benavente said that happiness is better to imagine than to have it. A lot of people would disagree with him but what probably everyone is agree with the need to some things to obtein it. There is a popular song which says the ideal ingredients are health to enjoy it love as a fellow traveler and money to make things easier. Every illness waste away anu happy feeling. Probably a sick person could achieve a momentary happiness but this would increase with a good state of health. We can't forget that in the end health breath into life and illness takes us to the opposite way. Love is a happiness' partner because both are similiar feelings. Furthermore the word 'love' includes several sides specially in English not only the affection for the other half but friendship tastes etc. And whatever you please and like makes you happy. Money itself doesn't have any value but it's a key which open lots of doors. As someone said money doesn't give you happiness but provide you a very similar feeling. However the virtue is on the middle and an excess money could turn a problem by the way an everlasting happiness must be terrible too . It is said that the small details of life give you the pleasure of happiness but in a material world most of them have a price. In the end hapinness is a cocktail and each person must decide his better recipe. However most of us would add to our drink health love and money. And if you can't get it now it's a comfort to know that it's better to think it than to have it.
