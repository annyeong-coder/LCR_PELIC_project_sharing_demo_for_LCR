These days I was usually curious about whether my English ability increase while I was studying here. When I first came here I didn't study a lot. I shouldn't have played with my friends who was from my country too much and I might have studied more or I could have met international students. However the time had already flied away. It was useless to regret about my past. I planned to study 6 months in here and half of the time had gone. I must try to achieve my goal within the left time. And I'll accomplish that goal before I go back to my country.
