Zeno who is Greek philosopher said a friend is Another I. I think a friend is someone who understands me. It means even though we have different personality it can be a good friend. I took a round about my friend relationship. Everyone can't fit to me. Even they are different with me we are good friend. We can understand each other. On the other hand if we have totally same personality between friends it can easy to fight or trouble. Every friend can't have same personality. They look just similar. I agree Zeno's opinion which he said what is a friend. Friend can keep my balance of my life because friend is another I.
