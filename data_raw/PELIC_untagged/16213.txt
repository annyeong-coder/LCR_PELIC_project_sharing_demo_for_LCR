May 18 2009 My favorite myth is Chang er Flies To The Moon. This legend has been said in Moon Festival. Houyi was considered a archery and he shot nine suns down to solve the drought. So he became to be announced to be a king and his lovely wife was regarded as a queen. Somehow Houyi was given the elixir of immortality by a celestial and his brother ANON_NAME_0 Kang knew he has the elixir of immortality. One day he tried to steal it when Houyi went hunting but it was be noticed by his wife Chang er. She was forced to swallow during she had a fight with ANON_NAME_0 Kang. After swallowing the elixir of immortality Chang er became to be light then she flied to the moon. When Houyi came back from hunting he was be told his wife is in the moon but he can't do anything for getting his wife back. At the end he missed his wife too much to death and Chang er would live alone on the moon with only white hares accompanying her forever.
