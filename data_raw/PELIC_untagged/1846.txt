I have always had a dream of going to the Hawaii Islands on vacation. I watched lots of movies about Hawaii. I have been planning this vacation for a long time. Finally I have solved my financial problems and saved enough money for this trip. I have heard many exotic stories about Hawaii. I have always been curious about how fantastic living in Hawaii would be. I have been living in the center of my country with harsh climate. Especially winters are really cold and tough. Therefore I have always wanted to live in a place like Hawaii. When I go to Hawaii next month I will lie on the beach and enjoy sunbathing for hours. I am going to drink different exotic drinks during the day. I will swim when I can't swim more. After the day I will wear my best sport clothes and go to the discotheques. I will dance until I can't stand more. Every night I am going to eat in different restaurants. At the end of my trip I wouldn't say that I would have to do this entertainment. I will have done all activities they could be done. I have to leave from Hawaii with unforgettable memories
