October16 2006 Dear Dad I am going to get a driver's license within the next few weeks but I'm still thinking about which one I want between cars and motorcycles. I can tell you some information about both of this two things. First cars are more comfortable and safer than motorcycles because cars have airconditioning and big seat but the most important is we sit in the car not like motorcycles that we have to sit out of it. Second if the roads have many snow it will be very hard to ride the motorcycle. I think also will be very cold when you are ridding the motorcycle outside. Third but the point is a car is more expensive than a motorcycle. So. . . What do you think Dad Please give me some suggestions. . . Love
