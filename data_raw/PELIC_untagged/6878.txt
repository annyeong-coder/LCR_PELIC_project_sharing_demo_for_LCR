The best place to go on vacation is Bodrum Turkey. There are many activities to we can get enjoy. First of all there is a big old castle. I think it has been there for over than five hundred years. After that there is a big harbor. There are many ships to go somewhere for visit to other places. Also there are many night clubs to dance drink something and more. I went couple times there and the first time I said This is the best place I saw in my life. The last time was before I came the U. S I went to Bodrum and I stayed almost twenty five days and decided to where is the best places Now I am living in the U. S. I can find new places to visit here. I want to visit New York because when I was in Turkey just I saw it from T. V but now I got a chance and I can go there. It could be better than Bodrum but I think Bodrum is the best place to visit. I went almost all Turkey's famous cities and I saw many differences between one city to another. In the summer time we can get much more enjoy from other cities such as water activities night clubs visit famous places but I think Bodrum has the best ones.
