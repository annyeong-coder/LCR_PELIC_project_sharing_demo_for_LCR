The school library is very rich and variety. It has a lot of useful stuff. When you walk in the entrance door the first thing you notice is that there is a lot of tables in the middle of the library. There are computers above these tables. In the right side you will see the BOOK CD DVD CHECK OUT desk and next to it there is a large paper recycle basket. There is a portrait between the CHECK OUT desk and the entrance door. Also there is a clock on top of the door. The book case is on your left hand when you enter the library. There is a plant beside one of the tables.
