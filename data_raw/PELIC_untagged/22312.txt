I have been to Pittsburgh for about 2 years. I have been studying in the University of Pittsburgh since 2009. I studied computer science in the school of arts and sciences for two semesters. I have studied computer science during those two semesters. Because I did not get a good grade for two semester. The school wanted me to take some English courses. So I decided to do well in the English courses.
