The Internet The invention of the internet is a great achieve for humanity. As a result of the hard work of many creative minds that make this possible. Many people use the internet this time. For everything and many things uses internet too. Like phones and computers. The invention of the internet causes many benefits to people. For example you can search about something quickly on our phone or laptop if you have internet. So this means that people have fast information and free in any place of the world. Furthermore you cannot only find information but also you can play games buy things make friends and download music. So the computer is a very important tool now days. The internet not only provides good information. Many web ANON_NAME_0 have prohibited content such as pornography and ANON_NAME_0 for adults. Due to children can't get in these ANON_NAME_0 when they are in the adolescence It's obvious that they want to know what this ANON_NAME_0 are about why they are prohibited and what I'm going to find on this page. So they get in and start to look at pornography or other things that is not a good factor in their development. We have to learn how to uses the internet properly. The internet has many benefits but simultaneously has many deficits. So we have to know what the correct use of the internet is and avoid these bad ANON_NAME_0. Also teach the children of the uses of internet. How to use properly he information that they provides us. My opinion about the internet is positive because we can learn many things in this virtual world. And it is helps the people to develop things. Furthermore we have to take care of what we are searching for because maybe it can be very dangerous.
