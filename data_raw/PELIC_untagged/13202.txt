English will continue to be dominant in the world. As economic globalization grows more and more people are encouraged to use English rather than their own language. There is the deep rooted relationship between linguistic social and economic mechanism so many people see the growing use of English as part of the unavoidable trend towards world wide uniformity. Although English has been eliminating other languages the dominance of English cannot be denounced because cultural imperialism is much more subtle than economic or military imperialism. These situations will develop English more into the world dominant language in the future.
