Founded at the end of the Second World War by the victorious allied powers the United Nations Organization UN was established to solve problems between countries in a peaceful way. At its head the UN Security Council SC comprises fifteen countries five of which are permanent and have a veto power . Those five countries were in fact the main powers at the time of the establishment of the UN and the veto power was then a condition for joining the new organization. Sixty years later although the world has deeply changed the five powers have retained the power to veto any decision of the SC. Indeed the five concerned countries argue that it provides more stability in the international system and helps to maintain a more peaceful world however given deep changes in the world geopolitics the Security Council does not reflect the current power repartition in the world anymore. Thus in order to reinforce the SC and thereby the UN an overhaul of the SC permanent members and the relinquishment of their veto power is a necessity. This question should not be understated by the USA. Indeed a more democratic UN would give more credits to the US Foreign Policy of spreading the democracy. Moreover since changes will soon or later be inevitable anticipate them by transforming the SC now that the USA still have the main influence in the UN would contribute to make the new SC as favorable as possible for the USA.
