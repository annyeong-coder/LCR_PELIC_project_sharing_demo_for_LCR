A friend is another I said Zeno a Greek philosopher. This assertion tells us what should be a friend. A friend is someone who can substitute you in social life. He is a person who will compromise himself to help you. He is also the person who knows you more than even your parents. He is the person who corrects you if you are behaving badly. He is the person who will tell you the truth even if you don't like to hear this truth. He is someone who is able to influence you. To correct their children some parents demand their children's friend to do that. A friend reflects your image. Some people say tell me who is your friend and I will tell you who you are
