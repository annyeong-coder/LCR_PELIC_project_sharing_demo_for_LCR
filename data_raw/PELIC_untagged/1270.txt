Reconsider how to save and make money They should cut charity donation They should save food payments Ray's wife should work as a part timer They should understand their plan They should get support about medical and education Pandit family will be in the red if they do nothing saving money or making money. They should reconsider using money. I have five suggestions to keep out of debt. First they should cut Charity donation. Charity donation is good for people but now they can ill afford to give charity. They are running a deficit. Second they should save their food payments. They shouldn't go out to eat many times because saving money is good for their financial. Third Ray's wife should work as a part timer to make more money. Fourth they should understand what they want to do in the future because if there is no plan they can't plan how much money will it need and how to use them. Last they should ask for medical social work to get support for Arturo's sick and ask educational institution to get scholarship for their children. So they should reconsider their financial problem. It is the best solution of financial problems.
