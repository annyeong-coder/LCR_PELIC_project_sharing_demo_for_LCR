I met my best friend Mamiko while I was attending a nursing school. She encourage me when I told her I seriously considerer quitting the nursing school. We got a nursing license when we graduated from the nursing school. While I was working as a nurse in a hospital she was also working in a public health center. Four years later I changed of my department when she got married. When she got pregnant she left the public health center. She gave birth to a girl while I was suffering from overseas education. I decided to study abroad when she devotes herself to her children.
