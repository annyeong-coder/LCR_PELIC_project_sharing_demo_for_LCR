My room is bright and sunny. The room cheers me up now because I did many improving in it. I tear down all the curtains and I will buy new curtains and do it over. Also I turn my bed around so now I can fell well because before that the sunshine's was coming on my face. Last week I picked new closet out and I hung my clothes up in it. I also took the computer disk away to the next side. Finally I put up some new pictures on the walls.
