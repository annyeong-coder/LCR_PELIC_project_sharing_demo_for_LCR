I have seen many violent movies most of which can relax me a lot when I was exhausted. Many people say the violent movies can't be seen by children producing negative impacts on society. In my view the violent movies could also play a role in education telling people what is moral behavior and what is amoral behavior. For instance I saw a film whose name is Salt. Acting as a spy in both USA and Russia Angelina Jolie who is imposed to become a spy in this movie. She was suspected by both countries deprived of all her properties. At last she got freedom from her friends who were her coworkers . People can discover the friendship could be found everywhere after watching this film .
