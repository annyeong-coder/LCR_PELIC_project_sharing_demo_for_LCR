When I heard the worst meal from teacher ''Jabchae'was flashed my head. It is one of the Korean traditional foods. I think that it was Chuseok's day last year maybe. Some of my Korean church members had wanted to spend time together and we decided to make a food each family. I do not like cooking and I do not know how to cook food deliciously. However I chose the food of 'Jabchae' I thought that it would be easier than other foods. I prepared fresh vegetables such as red peppers yellow peppers orange peppers onions and spinach meat and noodles. I did my best but the noodles were over boiled and were all tangled up much. For disentangling the noodles I poured a lot of sesame oils. It was useless. Unavoidably I mixed all ingredients well expecting delicious meal. Fortunately the colors of various vegetables made the food look good and delicious. My husband and my son comforted me. Though I was not satisfied with my cooking food there was no way. It was time to go my family went a house of my church members. All church members prepared foods which looked great. As soon as I saw them I told that I did my best but I was not sure taste to them. After that they ate my food and said it was good but they did not eat any more.
