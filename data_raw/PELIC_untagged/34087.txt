There was a park that was near my grandma's home and my elementary school. We called it JiaoTong Park. There were a river which was short and small in the park. People could go fishing there. Also there were many facilities which were for children to have fun. I still remember the purple big slide which was my favourite. The park is important to me because it witnessed many happy memories between me and my grandma who lived with me when I was a child. We always went there after she picked up me from my elementary school where I spent 5 years studying. We had a lot of fun in this park.
