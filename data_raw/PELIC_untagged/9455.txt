My Chinese name is Student's Name . The first name represents huge ambition and the last name comes form my father. I like doing exercises and watching sports games on TV. I used to play badminton with my father after school when I was young so I am good at playing badminton. I also like watching baseball games on TV and New York Yankees is my favorite baseball team because of the pitcher who comes from Taiwan. I also love to listen to music in my free time because I can relax by listening to music when I feel tense. In order to improve my English ability and get a master's degree I chose to go abroad to America last year. I am studying in the ELI and applying to the graduate school in University of Pittsburgh. I plan to go back to my country after accomplishing my studies. I hope that I can have more job opportunities to choose in the future.
