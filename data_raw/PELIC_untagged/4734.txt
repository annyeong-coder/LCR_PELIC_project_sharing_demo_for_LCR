Finally pack the bags. 2 Planning a weekend trip to another city requires five common steps. First preparing the budget is the most important step for any trip. For instance we make a list of all the possible expenses that we have on our trip. Then finding an appropriate place to stay should be done from the beginning such as making a reservation for a hotel online. In fact we make our choice of the hotels based on our trip budget. After that the car has to be checked. Especially we should check the fuel the oil and the wheels. Next we get maps and a tourist guide. At this point we organize a schedule for the activities that we are going to do during these three days. Finally we pack our bags and put them on the car to start the trip. I feel that it is helpful to plane a weekend trip to another city by using the previous five steps.
