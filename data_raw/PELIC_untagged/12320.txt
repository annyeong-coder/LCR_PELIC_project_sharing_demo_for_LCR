After wandering through the Yukon because of losing the way in range of the dangerous frozen muskeg a gold prospector with his two dogs found a relatively secure place on a small hill and fell into an uneasy sleep. As he slept he dreamt a fierce warrior threatened him to leave the muskeg and promised him to summon a guide for him. He was awakened and found a beautiful Native American woman was standing at the bottom of the hill. When he walked down the hill the woman transformed into a beautiful snow white rabbit and hopped slowly ahead of him and his dogs. After he found where he was by following the rabbit the white rabbit became once more the beautiful woman with smile and vanished as the first rays of the sun pierced the horizon.
