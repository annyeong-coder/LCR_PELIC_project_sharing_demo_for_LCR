It has the most important religious city the most wonderful beach and has one of the biggest deserts Empty Quarter in the world. First of all my country has the most important religious city in the Middle East. The name of this city is Mecca. It is located in the west of Saudi Arabia and it receives thousands of people every year. Every year people come from many other countries to do Hajj in the end of November or Thy Alheja month. Also the last prophet ANON_NAME_0 peace be upon him was born in Mecca and the Haram mosque is open 24 hours and 7 days a week. Thus Mecca is the oldest city in Saudi Arabia. Also my country has the most wonderful beach to visit. Half Moon beach is located in the east of Saudi Arabia. Half Moon has yellow sand and the beach hasn't dangerous fishes. Also the beach is very quiet and people always go to this beach and swimming. You can find the City Games beside the beach and there are many places for children to play. The beach has all utilities and service Such as bathrooms supermarkets and hotels. As a result if you decide to visit this beach on vacation you should go early because it busy in these days. Furthermore my country has one of the biggest deserts in the world Empty Quarter. It is a 620 mil long and 310 mil wide. Also Empty Quarter is the second most oil rich place. Some of Bedouin people live in this desert and they move from one place to other. Therefore it is a good chance to visit this desert and see the Bedouin people and how they live in this desert. In brief my country has the most important religious city the wonderful beach and has one of the biggest deserts in the world. In my opinion my country has many wonderful places to visit and if you try to visit it you will not lose anything.
