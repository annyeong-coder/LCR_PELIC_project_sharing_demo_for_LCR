My Father My father is the great man in my life. I admire my father. He is kind and genital man. My family is lucky with him. My father is an elderly man now with gray and heavy hair. He has a wrinkled brown face with beard. He wears a wrist watch on his right hand. He always wears a white shirt. My father has a nice smile with a golden tooth. He is medium height and he has a fun face. My father has an intriguing history. He was born in small town. When he was ten he moved to the city with his father. He worked as a teacher then he worked as a police man. Now he is a merchant. I hope to meet him again when I finished my study. He has interesting look. I wish to get a son and name him Hamed like my father's name.
