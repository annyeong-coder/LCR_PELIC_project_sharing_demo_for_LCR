Last weekend I went to the movie theater and I watched The big mama . The big mama is a comedian movie. The film talks about a two guys are pretending as they are womens which are the father and his son. The father is a police and his son is a singer. The film indicates many comedies parts. The boy garduate from high school and waiting for his acceptance from his University but the kis stocked with his friends everyday and convince him to leave uni and sing. When the father knew that his son started to sing he was like convincing him to starts continue his education at the uni. A lot of his friends whom like to hear his song tried to make from him a star till he find the girl that he loved her. The father got into a mission at the boy school whereas the girls dorm in it. So the boy agglutinated with his father in this mission by coincidence and they were both disguised as women to complete this mission but it was a good time for him to the girl who was his dream to be with this. The two things that I like is the way of pretending that they are womens and the way of attracting people by their reactions. The two things that I dislike is there are some concepts that is not matching with the movie and the beginning of the movie was kind of silly. On my perspective I really do recommend people and my friend two watch this movie
