Tree House When I and my three sisters were children we wanted a special place for play. Outside of my house has a big bright and green garden. Until today my mother take care every weekend's of her garden. She loves flower and plants because that she plant many kinds of flowers trees and fruit. In the garden has a strong and delicious smell of wet earth. The smell of flowers mixed are in the same time strong and soft. Also in the middle of the garden has a pool. Behind the pool and side of wall has a fruit tree. The mango tree is very very tall. She has many branches and leaves. It has branches thick and thin brown color and some are stripped. The leaves are green and everywhere has a nice smell of mango. The trunk of the mango tree is too thick and strong. Sometimes we can see ants climbing the tree. The garden is spacious bright and green earth. It smells of wet earth and there we can feel the heat of the sun tasty. How the mango tree was and still is big and string our dad decided build a house in the tree. The tree house was all done in dark wood. The trunk of tree had a small pieces of wood made like stairs. The house had square shape and her front and her back had a door. Inside of the house had two square windows of wood one in right side and one in left side. Inside the house had a lot of pillows and rugs spread over the floor that is where we sat playing. There we had a kitchen toy and boxes spread over the house for we keep the toys organized. In back of the house we had a small terrace for we play in sunny days. In right side of the house had a stairs made of rope and wood. Definitely this place was my favorite when I was child.
