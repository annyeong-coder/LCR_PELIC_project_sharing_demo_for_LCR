This essay make me feel sad. Al afraid to talk about impending demise to a little girl he also do not have confidence to get along with children. I think I have the same problem with facing impending death. Even though my dog leaved us for a period of time. I still cannot accept this truth. Chinese people always avoid to talk about death. We think if we mentioned anything relate to death is a bad luck behavior. I know this attitude is not so right but I just cannot adjust myself to accept death. I understand that death cannot be avoid but sometimes I still afraid this kind of the problem. I totally agree with Al why he has a lot misgiving about telling Jake's impending demise with a little girl.
