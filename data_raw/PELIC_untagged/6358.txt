Most of us work because they need money to live without money everybody could barely support their daily life. Thus it is so important to earn money to live. It is a kind of common sense that people work for money but some of them are not just work for money. These lucky ones work for specific purposes and earn money as side product of their efforts. Usually we can group these people into two categories work for interests and work for personal achievements. People who work for their interests are most lucky people in the world. For example some movie makers are so famous for their directing skills such as Ann ANON_NAME_0 and John ANON_NAME_1 whose interest happens to make movies. They enjoy doing their daily works and became rich and famous as side effects. The other persons who enjoy pursuing personal achievements usually have two clear characteristics they work so hard and paid less. For instance many scientists devote their youth to solve scientific issues. As I know in my area most diligent scientists work 16 hours a day six days a week doing experiments to solve problems. Furthermore they paid less than our imagination and they are almost like living in the lab. Working for more than money is everyone's dream. However I can hardly to tell that it is right or wrong because not everyone will get amazing side effects such additional economic benefits or become famous. As a result I think that everyone should firstly take care of their own daily needs by working. Then do anything they like for fun.
