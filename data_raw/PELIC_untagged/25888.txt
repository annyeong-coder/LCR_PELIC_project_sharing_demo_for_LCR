I think it's important for people to eat home cooked food because I have basic reason behind that. First can spend more time with family and learn the basics in the kitchen then enjoy fixing food together. Second at home food is cleaner and safer. Third can cook healthy food so when eat the healthy food the feeling is great and heaving more energy. Also eat in home is more comfortable than eat out. To illustrate As families began eating together less often many people grew up never learning the basics in the kitchen .
