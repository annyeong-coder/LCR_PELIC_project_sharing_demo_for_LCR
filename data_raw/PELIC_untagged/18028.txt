People who are in different country different area will have diverse culture various religion and faith. We should respect each other's culture and religion. I think the French government has infringed on Muslim women's right via banning and imposing restrictions on wearing the burqa. If the government says that France is a staunchly secular country and the religious clothing which has been worn in France is against their culture the government should instill French culture into the Muslim people who have been living in France through education until they agree to change their original faith.
