San Francisco is one of the nicest places that I have ever visited. If you go there you will see the Golden Gate Bridge which is a very long and beautiful structure. You may also go to Chinatown where many immigrants from China live and work. San Francisco is famous for its weather which is very unusual. It is always foggy and cool in the morning even in summer and the afternoons are always sunny warm even in winter. My friend who was born in San Francisco says that morning is autumn and afternoon is spring.
