I'm talking to about way to select a major. There are a lot of ways to select a major. In my personal experience I can say two ways that helped me to select a major. I considered an aptitude an interest and an outlook. I chose my major with these two important things. First things are an aptitude and an interest. When I was in high school student an aptitude specialist to me and that became my major. Three years ago I had an aptitude test and the result was saying the major that I chose. I think my aptitude have good matching with my major because I like my major and I'm interested in it. In another reason I got a high score at the subject that is related in my major. You will want to study and want to know about the major that you like and interested in. I considered an aptitude and an interest when I selected my major. Second is an outlook. Nowadays it is dull season in economic way. No matter how I have a lot of aptitude and interest about the major but if it doesn't have any visions there is no future. Of course present is important but future is more important. Now and also future we should select a major which is guaranteed our jobs and lives. In my opinion the important things are aptitude interest and outlook about the major for selecting. There might be more way to select the major because every people have their own views. To choose the major is not easy because it can make someone's future in his or her life.
