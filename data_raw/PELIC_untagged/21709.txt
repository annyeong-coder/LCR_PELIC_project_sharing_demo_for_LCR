Holiday All the cultures have the most important holiday. All the people prepare for their holidays by buying new clothes and some candies. Everyone feels happy when his important holiday is coming . In my home town the most important holiday is Aid Al fetter. This holiday is coming after Ramadan. Aid Al fetter means in Arabic the breakfast holiday because all the people in Ramadan were fasting. They celebrate for this holiday three days the celebration start from the morning then having fun in the night and relax.
