I think that they are 'the best friends' who understand to each other's sentiments. Moreover 'the best friends' who go shares in the good and bad things are true friends. I have known Da rea who is my best friend for 10 years. We met in the junior school which is located in Seoul. I became intimate with her whose personality is almost same from mine. She is a person who likes to meet the people and is lively. She is my best friend who is as intimate as a family.
