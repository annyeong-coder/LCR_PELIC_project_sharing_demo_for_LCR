FINDING REAL HAPPINESS It is not easy to find happiness for most people. Also I have been trying to find exact happiness for a long time. A healthy life freedom and a good job are the most important factors in finding happiness for me. Health is the foundation of everything. I have seen that many times. If you have a disease or handicaps it affects all your life. When I see disabled people I thank God I have been protected from these situations. How can people work and live comfortably without an arm or a leg It is a kind of limit to people's freedom. I always remember this and this is one of the causes of my happiness. I always love to be free. Not having any pressure from government or family is another cause of my happiness. Limiting my freedom always causes me a stressed life. For sure there are some limits in society which are meant to make society secure. However think about your family pressure which forces you to create your future with their desires and government's blocking to your ideas. I can't live with these limits so more freedom causes me more happiness. One of my important goals to reach during my life is get a good job which fits my dream job. People are working in different kinds of jobs which they don't want much. As a result they can't be happy. I want to find something new work on research about how can things change to better one for the welfare of humanity. If I can find a job which has this feature I will be happy. If I can't I will always have a sad side about that. Some people do not give up finding real happiness. Consequently they find better and happier life. I suggest you never give up searching and finding real happiness for you. Who knows maybe one day you will be happier than you thought.
