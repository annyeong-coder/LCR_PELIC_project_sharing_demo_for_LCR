Before coming to Pittsburgh I had never met people who came from middle east. Even though there are many foreigners in Korea I had never met the people. But now I have many friends who came from Audi Arabia and Livia. Sometime we have dinner together and talking about their religion and culture. It is the one of advantage of attending ELI.
