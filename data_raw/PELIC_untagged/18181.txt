1. After writing class last Friday Mark picked me up at the bus stop in front of the William Pitt union. 2. While we were driving on the I 279 we stuck in the traffic jam. 3. Mark told me I am exhausted. Because he just helped his girl friend moving to her new apartment and the traffic jam seemed no end. 4. When I arrived in Los Angeles Keng took me to eat real Chinese food. 5. I can't stop tearing while I was eating ANON_NAME_0 Pao Chiken. 6. While we were driving on the I 10 toward Phoenix to meet Hill our mutual old friend we stuck in the traffic jam again. 7. Because a serious accident ahead everyone was stopped. 8. Until the highway patrol towed the exploded car away Keng and I were just talking and waiting. 9. Hill and I had a long time hug since we have known each other for 20 years and he was going to leave America. 10. We saw a lot of amazing scenes when we continued our road trip by which we visited three national parks and drove across four states. 11. In the return we saw an irony scene the wealth gap between Mexico and America in El Paso Texas while we were driving on the I 10 toward west. 12. Because the Mexican neighborhood looked beautiful but poor I felt sad yet realized the reason why so many Mexicans left their beautiful home to other countries. 13. I rethought my career as a real estate agent since this experience was deep and meaningful. 14. I would become a person who truly care about the poverty gap and make business decisions with more ethical concerns if I constantly visit or approach this kind of city or situation.
