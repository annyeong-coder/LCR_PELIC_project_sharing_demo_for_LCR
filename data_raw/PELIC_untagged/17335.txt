Even though I feel rather comfortable and restful in my house. I would like to make some modifications for interior and exterior of my house. First I should straighten up the basement and get rid of exceeded stuffs. I also need to throw away the additional washing machine which doesn't work. After these common cleaning up process I am planning to put some carpets onto the basement because it is large in adequate and appropriate to utilize for the summer. Second I would like to set up the living room again. I probably begin with throwing exessive lambs out. Because I would like to hang up energy saver lambs onto the ceiling in order to light up a bigger range efficiently as I did in my country. By the way I could have not figure out the lack of lamps on the ceiling in the U. S. Third as the last I want to modify my backyard. In fact it is not appropriate to my purposes. What I like to do in my garden as I had been doing with my grandfather when I was in Turkey is growing up several vegetables and planting trees. In my country me and my grandfather have grown up approximately 250 trees in nice cooperation and most of them are fruit trees. If I think over to redesign of the backyard I have to tear down the wall in order to get larger area. Then I should take off unnecessary grass and fertilize the soil. What I need to do next is make several holes up to put distinct seedlings into them. I had grown up tomato pepper and parsley before. Actually I do not need to get these vegetables from my backyard but that is a kind of hobby that cheers me up when I see the my own grown vegetables as a result.
