Many people think that optimism more easier lead a person success. Of course the optimistic thinking always leads a person thinking more aggressive and faces one's problem directly. I agree with that but if someone who failed his her test could figure out why and do more preparing for next time and it will lead him get his goal soon or later. In the other way if someone only has the optimistic thinking without having action when he get some problem. As the adage says talking is easy than action. That is just like my point of view thinking is also easy than action. So if someone only thinks I will be better next time but he doesn't do any work to compliment the problem until next time the thing happen again. He is still failure it. Therefore the optimistic thinking lead the project forward to success but in anther way if a optimism doesn't do any hard work sometime the optimistic thinking will lead him failure.
