I have seen many good movies one of which was Breaveheart directed by Mel Gibson. I was greatly impacted. Breaveheart starring Mel G is one of biggest movies in the history. The movie about William W fought for the freedom against English rules. Another great movie is Titanic featuring Leonardo D. Titanic directed by James C directed many great movies like Avatar is a romance movie.
