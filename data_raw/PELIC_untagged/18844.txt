Dear ANON_NAME_0 There are many things that I want to do after this semester end. First I will go to Niagara falls with ELI on August 3rd and I think it will be great because I will go there with my ELI friends. And I have a plan to go to Washington DC again with my aunt. I went to Washington DC on last three weeks and it was wonderful. I took a lot of pictures and visit many memorials. After Washington DC I will go to New York with one of my housemates. In fact I supposed to go there on last weekend but I don't want to go because the exams are coming up on Monday. And on August 19th I will visit my cousin and friends in California. I will go to Sequoia National Park to visit my friends. We worked together over there. I miss sunshine that's why I want to go to California so much. And after visit friends in LA I will visit my cousin in San Francisco and then I will go to Salt Lake City Utah to visit another friends. Well I have many places to visit I afraid that I might spent all of my money in August. And how about you Do you have any plan for this summer Have a nice day Hwan Last Name
