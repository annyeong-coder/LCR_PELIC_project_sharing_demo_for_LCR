ANON_NAME_0 Last Name 02 09 2009 The similarities and differences between me and my brother The similarities and differences between brothers are widespread all over the world. Although most of the brothers are similar in most of their life there are some siblings are different in some issues. Even though my brother and I are approximately the same age we are different in choosing friends hobbies as well as personality. Choosing of friends deemed the most important thing in daily life. I am always concerning about making the friends relationship while my brother not. Therefore I do not have more friends. Most of my friends are the people whom I met them in the job or school because I know them very carefully. On the other hand my brother's friends are usually not work with him. Thus everyone should choose any friend who thinks the best one as friend relationship. Hobbies are usually depend on the personality or the identity of each person. For instance I like the challenge hobbies like soccer or even the electronic games. However my brother prefers special type of hobbies like barbecue and trips. Hobbies grow with each person and might be similar or different from person to another. Dealing and reactions with people reflect the personality of any person. I am always serious with other people and I admit this is disadvantage in some situations. In contrast my brother likes to be very joking with people. Therefore impression of people come from the personal personality. On balance my brother and I prefer a lot of similar things which is normal like any tow brothers. But making the relationship hobbies and personality still the main things that are different between me and my brother.
