A fad that interests you There are many different fads thet interests me such as the Slinky the Sily Putty the Mood Ring the Beanie Baby and the Hula Hoop . My favorite fad is the Hula Hoop . When its become very populer its really catches on every one wants to buy it . It was sold like hotcakes . Every one knew about it by word of mouth . I remembered thet all of my friends has one with a variation of different wild colors . When I bought it they gave me a small book has tips on it to help me how I can use it . When I was a kid every time when I get angry and in a bad mood I always go and play with my Hulla Hoop . Also in my opinion I think that Arthur Melin and Richard Knerr the ones who invent the Hula Hoop became very rich and they really made a mint .
