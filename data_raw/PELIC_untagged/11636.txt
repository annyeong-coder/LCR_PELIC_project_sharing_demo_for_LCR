In 2004 I decided to pursue a graduate degree in America. So I started to study the TOEFL and GRE examination as well as collection application forms of universities of the United States. If I had not decided to study abroad I would still be working at a software company. If I had listened to my boss suggestion I wouldn't have American life experience. Besides I might keep a relationship with a girl if I hadn't come to America. Regarding to this love problem I found many friends to discuss it. Jerry one of my friends told me If I were you I would choose to study abroad. After I decided my choice I wish she could accept my decision. Finally we broke up and I came to America to start my new life.
