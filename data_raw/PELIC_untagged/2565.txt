I had been working as an architect in turkey before I began living here. By 2000 I had decided my career. Before I graduated I had studied 4 years in collage. Before I came here I had worked 2 years and taken toefl. I couldn't passed and I am still working on this. I had collected all my english papers before I came here. I had done some reaserch in turkey. I had worked two different company and worked as a intern one company.
