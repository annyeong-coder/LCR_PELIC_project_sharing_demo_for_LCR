I love all my family. There are no other people like family. My parents had had so many obstacles while they were raising me and my sister. They had overcome without any help from other people. They have been doing anything for us. There are no word to describe how much I love them. Every time when I want to show my love to them it's not that easy for me. Because it's not enough to fill the love compare with my parents love for us. They had done so much for us beyond their abilities. If my parents are my most respectful people in the world my sister will be second in the list. She have dedicated about me so much. She'll be always in my side. Because she got married few years ago I haven's seen her much time but she calls me sometimes and asks about me. Nowadays I have been feeling of importance of family. Because I'm living alone here and two weeks later they'll have lunar new year. I never missed lunar new year before. That is most biggest holiday in Korea. I miss my mother's recipes and the memories with my father. Besides I had niece 14 months ago everything what she is doing make me happy. I'll love them forever.
