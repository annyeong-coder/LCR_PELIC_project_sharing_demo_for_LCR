I used to live in Taiwan. I had to ride a motorcycle to go work. I used to eat breakfast at home in the morning because I got up early. I had to put on my uniform and to make up so I took a lot of time. I used to assist my mother cooking dinner if a couple time. After dinner I used to practice running with my mother near my home. I spent much money on shopping and sang songs with my colleagues on the weekend. I am living in Pittsburgh. I take a bus to go to school every day. I don't eat breakfast because I have not enough time. I can put on suitable clothing in my mind. I have to cook by myself and buy something in the supermarket. After dinner I always do my homework every night so I don't practice running. I always learn new language and just hang out on the weekend.
