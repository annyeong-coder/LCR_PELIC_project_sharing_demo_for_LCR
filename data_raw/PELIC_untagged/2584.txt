By the time I went to high school I hadn't exercised everyday. Because I was very busy. However when I went to university I changed my mind to do exercise everyday. After I decided to do exercise I had been going fitness center for 1 year. Honestly I couldn't go there everyday because it was boring for me. I went to dance academy for my hobby after I stopped fitness club. It was great time for me because I haven't learned about dance before.
