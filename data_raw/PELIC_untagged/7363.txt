My selection is entitled New child labor law in India and it is about the Indian government's new law forbidding children under the age of 14 from working. Today the Indian government created a new law that prohibits children under the age of 14 from working anywhere such as a restaurant or a hotel or in a private home. Most Indian children have worked for a long time just like their fathers and grandfathers. Many of them are impoverished village kids. Even though the changing law prohibits child labor their environment still is not ready to relate to their culture. Because the child is very often excluded from schooling because they are working their families figure they might as well get a job but there are many cases of both physical and sexual abuse. Even though the new law may change the social atmosphere in a positive way unless the cultural attitudes about child labor also change it'll be hard to stop kids from working. 2Words Impoverish v to make sb poor Exclude v to deliberately not include sth in what you are doing or considering
