I was born and grew up in Seoul which is the capital of Korea. I can remember my childhood after we moved to a condo in Banpo dong where my parents still live. There are lots of buildings which have same style condos in this area. And it is close to the Han River which is the main river in Korea. My family used to go to the river side on weekends for picnic where we took a bike or caught a fish. And I used to play in a very spacious empty space which was a few blocks away. In winter some part of space changed in to a skate link where I spent most of my winter vacation. Once I entered the skate link when it opened and played all day long until my mother called me to eat dinner. It was really fun and enjoyable. Now everything has changed a lot so I can just recognize the location of the spot where I used to play.
