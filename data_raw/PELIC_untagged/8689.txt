Wherever you are it is your own friends who make your world. When I was growing up in Taiwan in elementary school I was in a musical school where all my classmates and I were in a Chinese orchestra. Everyday we practiced instruments together helped each other improve and performed together. All my classmates were my great friends whom I enjoyed the musical school life with. In 1992 it was the year that we won the championship in the national competition in Taiwan after years of practice and hard work. From junior high school to university I continued to attend musical school and made new classmates and friends whom I also enjoyed practicing musical instruments with. Even though these friends are new but they are the people that I spend the most time with. After I graduated from university and started my working life in Taiwan it was my co workers who I had to spend all my time to plan activities and events for my company. We became the good pals who worked hard together went to dinner and parties together and even went to sing karaoke together. Finally I came to the US and left all my friends and co workers in Taiwan behind. Here in the US I have to make new friends in the ELI who I discuss and improve English with. Even though I miss all my friends in Taiwan but I am also having a great time here in the US because of the new friends I made. I agree with the philosopher Ralph Barton Perry that wherever you are it is your own friends who make your world.
