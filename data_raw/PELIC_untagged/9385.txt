The Simple Life Goes to Camp. The summery At the beginnings Paris and her friend Nicole arrived to the camp. They went to the camp to help a group of people who have the same problem. After a few minutes a bus arrived with many fat guys. After they arrived a notation specialist gave them a lecture about the methods that they have to follow while they are at the camp. After that they divide they guys to two teams guys and girls. Then they started the first step which is cleaning their bodies. Every one of the teams brought his own food with him or her. The coach collected that food from them and kept them in the refrigerator. At 8 p. M. Girls team felt hungry and asked Parise to open the refrigerator to give them their food. Parise tried to open it but she could not. As a result she dragged the refrigerator by chains. However she could not open it. The camp owner noticed her and yelled at her and said go to sleep. However she did not go to sleep she took her group to the market to let them buy what they wanted. After that they went back to sleep. Next morning they ate breakfast and then they found that the guys team weight less than the girls' team. So the girls' team decided to work hard to lose weight. Parise took them to a nightclub to let the girls dance. In addition the guys decided to play football. Each group was doing its utmost to win the competition. They guys play football every day and the girls go to nightclubs and dance. After several days they woke up and brought the scale and weighted each team them it turned out the girls were less than the guys. So the girls won the competition. The movie which I watched was a comedy movie. Jon Prose Bob and ANON_NAME_0 are the actors who acted at the movie. David whom wrote and directed the movie. I whether recommend the movie or not there are people who love to watch comedies movies.
