Living in the U. S. Can be very interesting. The weekend holiday in the United States differs from the one I have in my own country Kuwait. In the United States Friday is the last day of work week for most people and Sunday is a day off for most people but in my country Thursday is the last day of work and Friday is a day off for almost everybody. Therefore due to living abroad I had to adapt to the daily life especially the way I spend my days whether on Fridays or on Sundays. Firstly after a very long week of working and studying obviously Friday is a day which I usually enjoy sleeping and surfing the Internet. Also I enjoy going out with friends and having fun. For example after classes finished me and my friends always plan to go to the movies or enjoy eating at any restaurant. On the contrary Sunday is a day where I usually stay at home and complete my homework. Moreover in this day I prefer making lunch rather than going to a restaurant. In spite of the differences between the two days and the way I spend my time in them sometimes I go to the movies with friend on Sunday evening before staring doing my homework.
