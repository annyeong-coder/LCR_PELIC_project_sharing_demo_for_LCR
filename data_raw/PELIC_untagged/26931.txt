Hi I'm Aziz. I've thinking to create my own wep site for three years and finally I succeed to do it. I was born in Saudi Arabia. I've studied physical therapy there. I hav'nt get the master degree yet. I'vce been doing karate since 2004. I like watching movies sitting at the beach and doing sports. I moved to the United States in May 2010 to get the master degree in the feild of physical therapy.
