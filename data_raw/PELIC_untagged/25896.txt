One of the funniest situations that I have been participated in was at ELI. It was in the first day of April when ELI news announced that there would not be final exams and instead of that ELI would give each student an A as a gift. When I heard that I went to Cris and told her that I made my reservation for my trip to my country early. When she heard that I made the trip early she got shocked. She said the person who wrote the news is joking with all students because it is April fools day. I had known that it was a joke but I wanted to make fun at Cris. What is funny about that is she announced to the students that ELI news today is a joke. After that I told her that I am joking with her.
