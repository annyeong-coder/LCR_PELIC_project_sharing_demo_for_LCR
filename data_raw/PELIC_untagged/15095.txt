My favourate hobby is playing table tennis. I was a professional player and practiced in province's team for 3 years. Since I was 9 I have been playing games all around my city. I has been learning play table tennis ever since my father created a professional club of table tennis. Many player in the club taught me included my father. I have not been playing table tennis since I came to US. I read many news and serched many information but still no place fit me to play in Pittsburgh. The same situation as my friend he has been playing tennis since he was 12 but still feel not easy to find a place to play here.
