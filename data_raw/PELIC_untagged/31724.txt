After I had finished my master course I worked as an assistant of professor for 2 years. At that time I thought this experience was very helpful to me. However now I regret about that. I shouldn't have gotten the job right after finishing the course and I ought to have written my thesis to graduate the Master course. If I had done that I would get master degree and it would be easier to apply to Ph. D course in the USA than now. Moreover I should have studied English harder before I came in Pittsburgh. For example I ought to have memorized more vocabulary and should have listened English more. If I had practiced more now I could talk with my American friends fluently. I feel sorry about all wrong decisions of my life. On the other hand I shouldn't have regretted the past because this kind of thought made me depressed sometimes.
