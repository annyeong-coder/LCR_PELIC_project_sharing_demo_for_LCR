In this speech Hans Rosling talked about the changes of the developing countries. People thought those countries have large families and short life however from 1960 until now there are huge shifts in their birth rate life span and income. Today if you compare the US with Vietnam you would be surprised at the same life expectancy and family size. He also said that a country has a batter healthy level at first would make advance faster than a country has a nice wealthy level at first. He reminded us of using the average of the data of the GDP may be dangerous because there are the richest people and the poorest people in a country. He thought that it is very important to use these data free and make them searchable since the number of Internet users is getting more and more and these information can help us recognize the economy of the world.
