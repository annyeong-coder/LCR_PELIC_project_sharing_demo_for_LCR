I have several advices to give to a new ELI students while he she just come in. The most important thing is that please be able to talk with native speaker anywhere. In addition you might rent a apartment with native speak when you just come to USA it would help you get use to new environment. Also you should participate in ELI activities so that you could have fun with other students from different countries. The more important thing is that you should memorize new vocabulary as possible as you can because build vocabulary will improve your lever higher. Finally please be friendly in your life.
