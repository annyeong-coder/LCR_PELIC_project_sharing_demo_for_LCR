1 It is almost the same thing. Surveillance simply means to observe someone. I actually had that experience when I was a kid I was under the surveillance. I could not do anything instead of following teachers' rules because he inhibited me! 2 Evaluation has a general meaning. However self assments is belonging to the attribute for kids. According to my experience I'm so apprehensive about my friends' grade I usually think about what my classmate will get in every test no matter what my friends get. Even if they get Zero and that is totally wrong I should be stratified about my grade. 3 I think there are some differences between rewards and recognition. Rewards are the thing or the value that recognized student get. When I was in high school I tried hard to get reward because I see my closed my friends get a lot! That encouraged me to better and not to kill my creativity. 4 Competition is a good thing and it gives students a great opportunity to promote their level of education
