Marriage between people from different countries is increasing nowadays. It is an incorporation of two different cultures and religions. In my opinion marrying someone from a different religion has a lot of disadvantages and has a bad effect on the family. The first reason is that parents from different religious will face a lot of religious resistance during their children's upbringing and may have a serious problem with each other. For example each parent will want to raise their child in his her religion. The other reason is that there will be a lot of psychological conflicts in the children's lives. For example they will see a different way of praying if one of the parents is Muslim and the other one is Christian. In addition in school they will be confused about which religion they are if any of their friends ask them about their religion. It is nice to be open to other cultures and religions and not to be strict about yours but there are different ways to do that instead of through marriage. Marriage is a big responsibility. We have to be more careful and serious about it.
