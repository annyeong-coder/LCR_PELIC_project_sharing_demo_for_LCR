Posted February 16 2006 at 15 30 03 Hi everybody. I'm writing this note to introduce myself to you my classmates in English 047. Our teacher wants a profile from each of us. At first I was confused by this assignment because my English dictionary defines profiles as a side view of someone's head. I thought Why does she want that She sees my head every day! Then I saw the next definition a short description of a person's life and character. OK then. Here is my profile My name is Student's Name . Some of my friends call me Pay Ha because that is how my initials sound in German. I am studying English here in Miami because I want to attend graduate school in Colorado or Montreal. Maybe you are asking yourself Why do I want to leave Miami to go to these places The answer is snow! I come from Austria so I love to ski. In fact My nickname in my family is Blitz lightening because I am always trying to improve my speed.
