Have you ever heard about the !Kung The !Kung live in the northwestern part of the Kalahari Desert. I'm going to compare the !Kung diet and food that college students eat. First the food that the !Kung eat is limited. They only can eat things that they hunted and gathered. For example they usually collect roots nuts fruits vegetables and hunt animals for their meals. Among these kinds of foods the most important food to them is mongongo nuts. As you see all food they can eat is limited. They don't have many choices what they are going to eat for meals. How about college students There are many kinds of food that they can choose and eat. They can choose pizzas hamburgers subs cereals or pastas for their meals. Also they can feel like eating other food just putting different sauces on pasta. College cuisine is versatile. Then I'm going to compare how much nutrition their food has. The most important and popular food to the !Kung mongongo nut has five times the calories and ten times the protein per each meal than cereal crops. There is a lot of nutrition in mongongo nuts. Thus they can consume most of nutrition that people need even though there aren't many kinds of foods. What do you think about foods that college students eat Do you think they can get nutrition that people need from kinds of foods they usually eat Your guess must be right. Foods that are in a college don't contain all the nutrition that students needs. In addition these kinds of foods have bad things that are not good at our health like salt sugar or caffeine. If you eat these kinds of foods a lot it can hurt and spoil your health.
