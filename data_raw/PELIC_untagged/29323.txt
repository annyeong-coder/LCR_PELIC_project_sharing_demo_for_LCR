A long time ago my best friend asked me how would my life have been different if I had been born a male. It was an interesting question and I enjoyed answering it. If I had been born a male I would have driven a car and gone to safari with my friends. Also I could have traveled alone. I would have chosen when I would have gotten married and who would have been my future wife. Because I am not interested in cooking I thought if I had been born a male I would have never cooked and no one would have the right to required me to do this. All of these things are allowed for male in my country.
