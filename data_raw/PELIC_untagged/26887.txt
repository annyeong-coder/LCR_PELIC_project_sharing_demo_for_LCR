Eid Al ftur Every year billions of Muslims around the world celebrate for Eid Al Ftur that begins after Muslim's holy month Ramadan every year since 579c 1431 years ago . However in Eid al Ftur all Muslims celebrate in many different ways it depends on the personal culture. There are many examples. First of all before the Eid many people prepare for that day by shopping to buy a new clothes gifts and perfumes. According to the Islamic conception it is better for you to acquire new clothes for yourself and give gifts to others. Before the first day of Eid people take a bath wash the clothes decorate the house and sleep early to wake up before sunrise. In the first day of Eid. The family wake up early wear their new clothes and go to Eid prayer. After Eid prayer neighbors congratulate each other. Secondly after Eid prayer and congratulations with neighbors has done the family gathers usually in the oldest member's house and drink some coffee or tea and eat the first morning breakfast after one month of fasting. However at this time the family start trading gifts usually the father reward the children a big amount of money that the children have been waiting since the year before. Nevertheless some families give a simple gifts to their children. Finally the lunch time starts after trading gifts the family sits on a huge table full of great food to eat a lunch that they missed. After finishing lunch the family prepare again to go out either to visit the rest of the family or to fun places that makes the children enjoy the rest of the day. Nevertheless some leaves the family and go out with best friends and enjoy the rest of their day. This is how Muslims enjoy Eid Al ftur because they see all their family re connect with them listening to their stories and go out with them to a places that they love. This is why they wait for this great holiday every year. I'm waiting for the nearest Eid holiday to have much fun.
