As a matter of fact no one can deny that the weekend days are the best days for all workers and students. Some people prefer Sundays and others prefer Fridays. As it known in the US Friday is the party day Sunday is the study day. So a lot of people prefer Fridays because it is the first day in weekend and the last day in work or school. On the other hand when Sunday come everyone become depressed because it is the last day in weekend and the day after it they should go to schools or work. Students hate Sundays because they should do their homework assignments and study in this day. It is crucial to study every day but some students do their work in Sundays to enjoy their time in Friday and Saturday so it's obvious why they like Fridays more. For sure workers do not need to study or do homework assignments but they feel depressed when they think that they have work on Monday also some workers need to work over the weekend so they just enjoy Sundays. I prefer Fridays more than Sundays because I think that I have two days until Monday and I can do whateve I want also I can stay up late because there is no school the day after Friday. A lot of Students reveal their happiness in Fridays by going to the movies or the restuarants which I do all weekend. Sunday is the day I hate because I need to do my work and I can't to stay up late. So in every country students hate Sundays and love Fridays because they can party all the night and do what they want. But they hate Sundays because it is a depressed day.
