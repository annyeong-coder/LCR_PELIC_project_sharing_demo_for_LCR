Although ELI has some many advantages for foreign students it still has something could be improved. As far as I can tell the activities ELI organized are really interesting but could be more useful. We have had many activities like traveling sporting shopping and so on. However most of students in ELI who have just been lived in American less than 1 year confused about some problems which happen in real life. For example how to talk with doctor about diseases How to deal with money in the bank I have an experience in this situation. When I just arrived in Pittsburgh I need save my money in the bank. The staff in the bank told me that I must have two accounts which are saving account and credit account. I didn't know what's different between them and my listening was really poor at that time. I can't know what she meant. Fortunately it seems she had had many experiences about foreign students' requirements. She helped me to complete the bank's process. But I still confused about saving account and credit account and I was afraid of going the bank until I improved my English listening. In fact I would accommodate to American life more quickly if I can get some help from ELI. In short personally I wish that ELI could have some talk time or like that introduces us some knowledge about American life.
