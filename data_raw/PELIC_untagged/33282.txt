In my opinion I think the HIKIKOMORI is the most unusual ican't understand their cocept in life. Because they are young men at the same time they set themself apart they reject even to clean the surrounding area and they isolate themselves in the room to spend all the day playing video games. Despite the BAKHTIARI people they live normally except they refuse the modernistic life.
