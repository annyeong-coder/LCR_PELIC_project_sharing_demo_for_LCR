I want to talk about Aboul. Before he came from his home he was hoping to go to US for study. As soon as he graduates he'll look for a job. When he graduate he is going to go his home for visit his family. While he looks a job he will study france language . By the time he gets a married he'll gets a job. When he graduates he will look for a car. Before he gets a married he'll look about his wife. He's going to buy a house after he has a lot of money.
