My major is computer science but people say it doesn't fit to me and sometimes I also think so. Maybe I should have chosen my major more carefully. Actually I could have decided it to Korean literature or business but I liked computer more. However it was so different and harder than I thought. I had to learn a lot of computer languages. In fact I didn't know that even computer has a langauge! My father should have told me that I wouldn't get through this or perhaps he did but I didn't care. I should have listened to him. Anyway I'm regreting now.
