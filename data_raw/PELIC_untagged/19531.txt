If I won the lottery first of all I would like to go travel all over the world with the money. I visited several Asian countries but there are still lots of countries which I have not visited. When I traveled some foreign countries I saw a lot of beautiful natural environment and had some diverse experience. Both of them were great. Furthermore I had great opportunities to taste some traditional food from the region. How awesome it was! I think most people want to go on a long journey for these some reasons but most of the people don't. There is couple of problems however the biggest reason is money. Well so am I. Then because of a number of reasons if I won the lottery I would like to go travel all over the world with the money.
