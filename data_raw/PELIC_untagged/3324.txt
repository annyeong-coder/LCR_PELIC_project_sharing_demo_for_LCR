Hi Mike I'm getting ready for the party tonight. I've already bought the soda and some chips but I haven't gotten the tomato sauces yet. Joe is helping me. He has already prepared to make the pasta but he hasn't made the sauce. And I've already picked out the good music. I've already invited my friend Alok but he hasn't arrived yet. Maybe he hasn't finished his work yet. I think this is a wonderful party.
