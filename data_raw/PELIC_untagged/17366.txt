I'm living in a share house and my room is in 3rd floor. So right now my room is a little bit hot. When I go to school I always open the door to let in a cold breeze to my room and when I'm in the room I turn on 2 fans and that help me a lot. In the first day here I decorated my room by hung up my family and friends's photos. There is white bedside table so I moved it around and set everything up. Usually I straighten up my room on Wednesday and Sunday because I don't have class and also everyone in the house have to clean up living and bathroom at least once a week
