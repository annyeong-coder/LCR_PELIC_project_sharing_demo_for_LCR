In the average human breathe 17 times per minute it means we breathe 24480 times a day. It can show that air plays an important role in our daily life. However due to the developing of factories and other air pollution such as the growing of the air flight field those all force air not as fresh as many years ago. Thus improving air quality is very important. In order to make air become fresher every country needs to manage their air pollution. They need to draw up laws which are about air pollution. The law needs to stipulate the standard of pollution and the penalty of violating the law. In addition to this everyone has the responsibility to refresh air. For example we should take a public transportation instead of driving car we should not cut down too many trees and we also need to pay attention if we produce air pollution or not. Air is valuable if we don't have fresh air to breathe we can imagine it will be very terrible and harmful to our health. Therefore we need to do our best to improve air quality and this is everyone's responsibility.
