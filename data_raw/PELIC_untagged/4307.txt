When I worked as a nurse staff had to work in three shifts. However a boss worked only noontime and only weekday. Oneday when I worked in weekend a patient complained to me about some staffs. And then I told my boss about it but she didn't care. After that I didn't talk to my boss. So my boss must have noticed I was angry. I thought if I worked with a different boss the atmosphere at work might have been confortable for me. But I should have pushed to my boss to solve that problem. My boss and I could never have had a lot of time to talk about problem. My boss must have been busy because our hospital was established at that time.
