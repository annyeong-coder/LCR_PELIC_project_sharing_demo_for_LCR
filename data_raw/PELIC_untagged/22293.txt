Hi I've been living in Pittsburgh for six months. Also I've been studying at ELI since Sep 08 2009. I've looked for a new apartment for month and finally I found it in Squirrel Hill. Since I've moved to Pittsburgh I've tried to buy a new car. I've been working for a IBT Toefl preparation course for a couple of weeks. I had associate degree in Mechanical Engineering from Jubail Industrial College. Many of my friends were celebrating when I got engaged. In fact I got married last year. I haven't gotten children yet.
