My name is Chi Yung. I have been to Pitt for 5 months. Because I want to improve English ability I came to American in January. Although in Taiwan I have been studying English over 10 years my speaking and listening are not very good. I have played baeketball since I studied senior high school. Therefore I have been playing baketball on weekend. Although my English is not very good I also watched American drama in my university.
