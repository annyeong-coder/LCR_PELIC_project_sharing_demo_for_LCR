I was studying in unveirsity when I met my best friend ANON_NAME_0. One day I had a linguistics class. A new student entered and sat beside me. While I was readin a book he introduced himself to me. After we finshed clsses I invited him to have lunch with me. He accepted my offer. I took him to a famous restaurant. While we were waiting our lunch we talked about ourselves. Later on ANON_NAME_0 became one of my best friends
