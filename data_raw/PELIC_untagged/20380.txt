2 Month ago I went to Boston with my husband because there live our friends. We went for 4 days only. I put some clothes in my suitcase. For example 4 T shirt 3 pants 2 shirts 1 towel and some underware. The first day we went to the Boston Commons Park walked aroud to the North End that is like a small Italy City and also we walked following the red line that is a red mark on the street that pass cross the most important historic houses in Boston. The weather during the weekend was sunny so we enjoy the City. On Saturday we went to Cambridge and visit the campus of Harvard and MIT. There was a lot of people on the street and around the Charles River that is the river that separate Boston and Cambridge. On Sunday we went to Cape Cods aproximately 1 hour and half by car from Boston it was a beautiful landscape and beaches. On Monday we drove from Boston to Pittsburgh like 9 hours and 500 miles.
