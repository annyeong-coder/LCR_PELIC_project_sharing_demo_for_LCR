I have been working hard since this semester started. I have been attending five classes four days a week and I have enjoyd extra conversation classes such as Talk Time and Coffee Talk . I have done my homework assignments and submitted them on time. Moreover I have tried to actively participate during class. When possible I have organized some dinners out with my friends so I have practiced my conversation. Unfortunately I haven't had much time to engage in extra curricular activities such as watchin TV or reading so I may have missed some opportunities to improve my vocabulary and my listening abilities.
