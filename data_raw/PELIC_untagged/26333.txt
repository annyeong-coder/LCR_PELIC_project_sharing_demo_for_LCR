The day of the dead This celebration differs according to the region where your are from. However in my native San ANON_NAME_0 begin three weeks before that date. The markets around my town start to cater for all the items typical of the festivities. Some items are sugar skulls crossbones coconut candies some made of pumpkin peanuts fruit jellies and all kinds of flowers and fruits. Going to the market in those days is an indescribable joy when you are just a kid.
