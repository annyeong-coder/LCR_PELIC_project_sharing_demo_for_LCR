Johnny Depp is one of the movie stars that I like and I think movies most of which he has stared are interesting. I've watched ALICE IN WONDERLAND recently. Although I wanted to watch this movie 3D in Japan I was really busy and couldn't. However I was able to feel 3D atmosphere while I was watching it at home without 3D glasses. The story was simple because it was based on the famous novel. But this movie's Alice was the most mature character which I had ever known because she didn't show smile face so often. In this movie I saw a lot of strange and weird creatures all of which made a strong impression on viewers. And of course Johnny Depp's character whose hair was red and eyes were red was also unique. But the character that I liked most was the red queen. Although she was a bad queen of whom everybody is afraid I thought she was cute. I think this movie is the one which people can enjoy as an entertainment.
