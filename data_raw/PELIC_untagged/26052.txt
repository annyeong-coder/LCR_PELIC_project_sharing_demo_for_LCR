Dear Mr. ANON_NAME_0 I am a student at the EFL Computer Training Institute. My classes are very good but the Institute had better make some improvements or many students are going to leave. First I think you should empty the trash. Second perhaps you ought to change the broken window. Third maybe you should sweep the class. Fourth In my opinion you ought to redecorate the ceiling. Fifth from my prospective you should buy a new copier. Finally I think you ought to buy more computers.
