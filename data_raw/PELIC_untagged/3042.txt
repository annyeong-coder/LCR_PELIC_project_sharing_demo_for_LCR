In Korea about 100 years ago the country was quite undeveloped compared with nowadays. The people lived in Korea have developed very fast and have achieved a lot of things. At that time Korea was a hierarchial society so they were classified into the King royals commoners and slaves. The King had absolute power and citizens had to obey the King. For example if the King wanted someone's estates they should give their estates to the King. In my opinion it was really unreasonable. Also they didn't have any currency so if someone needed food they should find the person who had food and then they would barter food and something what the person needed such as animal or some products. Maybe it was too uncomfortable to them. In addition I believe they lived in Korea 100 years ago didn't have enough transportation therefore only the King and specific royals used to use the sedan chairs or horses and almost people except them moved on foot. That was Korea's past situation but even if it was a too illogical society in the modern view they did their best to develop Korea. So I believe that they weren't wrong they just did the best in their circumstance.
