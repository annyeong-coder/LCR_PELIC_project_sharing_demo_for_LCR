My Ideal Apartment When I buy my ideal apartment I would like it to be open and spacious. The whole area has to be divided into three principal parts. First the social area must have living room dinning room study room and a balcony. I prefer that the living room and dinning room are open and spacious with high ceiling a big window or maybe a glass door that I can open. I would like this area to be adjacent to the balcony because I could open this glass door and make this area bigger. I would like to have just enough space for a BBQ area a jacuzzi and a garden. I want my study room to have enough space for a desk a TV a big bookcase and a sofa. The study room should have one o more windows because I want to see the landscape through it and it could have more light. The second area will be the kitchen. I would like it to have a kitchen island in the center with a big stove and a big table with some chairs. I prefer that this area has a good ambiance because I could stay there for a long time. The last area is my room. It has to be opposite to the kitchen. My room should be clear and spacious. I want that this room has a dressing room a relaxing area with a elilptical or exercise bike and a spa area with a sauna bath. Finally the bathroom will have a big bathtub and also a shower. I would like a big mirror with many lights. In conclusion I would like my ideal apartment to have open and spacious areas. Where I can enjoy different moments with my family and I could make it the most beautiful and nicest place.
