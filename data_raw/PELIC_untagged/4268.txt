When I was a child I watched a documentary which was about the greatest mystery in the world. I was impressed by Nazca lines which were a very mysterious. The Nazca Indians must have flown in the air because they drew the huge elaborate drawing. People could find this world mystery in the air after the advent of a plane. The Nazca Indians had to have invented an air balloon and they might have possessed technical skills of design drawing. They might have respected the nature because they drew many animal symbols. Or Aliens might have built these lines for their special signs and the Nazca Indians may have worshipped Aliens.
