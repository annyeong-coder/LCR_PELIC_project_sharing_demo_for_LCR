Unfortunatly my room in Pittsburgh is too small. I hope to tear the wall down and build another one. I want to hang up some pictures. I love natural pictures such as sea or mountain pictures. My room is dark and I want to light it up. I hate the carpt's color I should to throw it out and put a new one down. I will pick out a brown carpet but at first I should to look it up on the Internet. I will write down all these changes and probably I will do it one day.
