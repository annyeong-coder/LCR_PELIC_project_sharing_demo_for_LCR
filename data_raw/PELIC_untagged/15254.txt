My Room My bedroom is a nice room like any room in my house but little bed different . When you come in you will see a big flower vase next to door of my room . Then if you look at a wall you will see a clock . Beside the clock is my grandfather's picture under the pictuer is my desk . My computer is fron of a clothespress . Front of my bed is atable there are many kind of wax light on the table . When you open my book case you will find in it many kind of books . I am proud of my room because if someone visits my room he usually says it is a nice room .
