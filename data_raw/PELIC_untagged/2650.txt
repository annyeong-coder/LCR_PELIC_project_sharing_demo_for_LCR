It is easy to fail a test for every student but not me because I am such a good student since I started to study. But I still have some ideas to tell you how to fail a test. First you can attend a class but ignore what teacher says especial when teacher tell you it is important for testing. Do whatever you want except listening to your teacher. Second you might take a note during the class as you paid but don't preview or review the notes when the test. Third if you don't want to go out with friends you can stay up all night to play on line game watch TV movie or talk with your friend. In another way if you want to go out with friends please having a party with them all the night before the test day. Then you will out of energy to take a test. Finally the most perfect way to fail a test is leaving all blank on without writing any single word during the test. After taking one of my suggestions I promise you will100 percentage to fail a test
