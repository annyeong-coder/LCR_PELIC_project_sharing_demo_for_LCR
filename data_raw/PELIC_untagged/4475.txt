As someone goes in to my room they think my room smells like an apple. Because I burned apple candle last night. By the wall they will see my piano. Then they can probably figure out I play the piano. When they see my desk which is placed in front of piano. There will be whole file of books about chemistry and biology on the desk. At this point they will be able to know that I study in biology and chemistry. By the time they open my closet. They will know that I am a blue person. Because there will be placed load of blue clothes. Even they look at my bed they can find out that my favorite color is blue. While they are in my room they will find lots of candles in my room. And they will think that I like to burn candles too. If they look down under the desk there should be big file of TOEFL text books they can make a guess that I used to study TOEFL. They can also easily find my last TOEFL score. Because I put it in there. I can imagine what their face looks like. When they go to the table by my bed they will see the jewelry box they will know I like gold jewelry. They will also see the poster of fall out boys . It's easy to make a guess that I am huge fan of that band.
