I met my best friend who lives in Seoul when I was in middle school. He likes playing sports such as basketball soccer and badminton. We frequently used to play basketball together with other people who wanted to play with us. He majors in law. He wants to be a lawyer. He could not pass the law exam which takes a test per year. He has a lot of stress which he has to pass the law exam. Whenever I call my the friend I encourage him to be able to pass the law exam. I sometimes talk him over about the future.
