Regarding the first time when I met my wife it was a wonderful moment in my life. My wife is one of my relative and she holds the same my family name. My family and her family have been visiting each other for a long time. When I thought about how I can choose my wife and how she would be I was asking some of my friends about this issue. One day I went to my mother and opened this topic for her. Then I asked her about looking for one pretty woman to would be my wife. By that time I had taken my degree from university. After few weeks one of my sisters suggested to me to get engage to ANON_NAME_0. I said to her it was going to be nice marriage when I get from that family specially my honey ANON_NAME_0. Next I showed that on my parents and they encouraged me. I called ANON_NAME_0's father to meet him to talk about my intention. I was very glad when he accepted me to would be a husband for his daughter. Then he showed this issue on ANON_NAME_0 and she also accepted me to get married from her. After that I was arranging my self to meet her before engage to her. By that time I had been very anxious about something new for me. However when I saw my wife I feel very comfortable. Therefore I decided directly to get engage to ANON_NAME_0. During that time I would call her by phone every day and take a long time to talk together. I was thinking that our life was going to be very beautiful. In fact that is totally true and our life is very sweet.
