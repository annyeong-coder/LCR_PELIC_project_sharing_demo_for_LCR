When I was a child I had a big bedroom. I stayed alone. A door was opposite a wardrobe which was opposite a sofa. The sofa was near my desk which was on a lot of books. My desk was near my bed which was opposite a window. If I looked a window I saw a beautiful tree who saw it was near played kids. A carpet center of the my room which was on a lot of toys.
