Before I moved here I had never played volleyball. One day one of my friends asked me to join their team because they had been short for members and I agreed. However it was difficult than I expected so I have been training it every Tuesday. I had never taken classes which take palace only in English before I came here so it's hard for me. But I have felt the more spend time in US the more I have been getting better than before.
