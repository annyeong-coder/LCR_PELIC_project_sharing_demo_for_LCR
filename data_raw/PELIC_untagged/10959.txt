There are many crucial things in our relationship with others. For me however the truth is the most important consideration in our relationship. I would rather say that the truth is the power of relationship. To lie looks just attractive in many cases. People also lie just to avoid difficult situation immediately. For example we can see easily that many well known people show up on TV with debates. Finally they even go to a court to draw the truth out even though there is only one truth. At the end of debate the truth is proved eventually. If the person was not truth lied to everybody. The person can not be forgiven by people not only because he did faults but he lied. In fact generally people tend to be generous to person who does faults. On the other hand they are pretty strict to the person who lies. Also to lie usually makes the situation much worse and the person feel guilty more. Not telling the truth usually make people loose their fame and reputation. Also everyone leaves the person out of disappointing. For me when I was very young I lied many time. Whenever I did my parents spanked me a lot and never forgave me. However though I made a serious problem they always forgave and comforted me if I told truth them. So since my days in childhood I've preferred to tell the truth. If I always lied I could have never built good relationship with my parents and my friends because they would not have trusted me. Telling is the most crucial factor for good relationship.
