I study English every day. My teacher gives me homework every day. After studying English I go to my apartment. I sleep just one hour and then I take a shower. I usually make coffee or tea and I dress in simple clothes to help me relax before writing the homework. I go to my bed and close the door because I need quiet. After that I open my computer because there is a dictionary and Microsoft Word on the computer. They help me to write the homework. For example I am writing this homework on Microsoft Word now. This is my routine to write my homework.
