My friend's birthday party. It was last year. My sister and I went to my friend's house. We were all arranging the place of the party at 4 00 when her mother came. While my friend was putting the balloons on the ceiling she fell. But she did not hurt. Everyone gave my friend a present and a birthday card and wished for her a happy birthday. We put the candles on the cake and we sang 'Happy Birthday'. While we were eating the cake everyone was chatting and laughing. Finally we went home after we had a lot of fun.
