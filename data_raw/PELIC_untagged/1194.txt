My husband and I came to Pittsburgh in April 2005. The next day we arrived here was my birthday. We didn't settle down completely and have enough stuff like furniture dishes and so on. We just bought a microwave on that day. I didn't even care about my birthday but my husband tried to give me a birthday party. We didn't know any restaurants yet so he went to a certain supermarket in Pittsburgh and bought two pieces of cakes and two boxes of prepared frozen meals. At that night we had a small party with those foods. First we were looking forward to eating them because we were so interested in how taste American food was. The frozen meals were new and interesting taste to us. I mean they tasted bad. So we expected the cakes but we felt like we were eating sugar itself because they were so sweet. After all we didn't have anything delicious on my first birthday in the U. S. Even it was the worst meal I've ever had in my life.
