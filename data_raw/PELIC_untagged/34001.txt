P. 235 5. Home is not where you live but where they understand you. I think this means that home is not just a place home is where my family lives in. My family is the people who are on my side all the time. My home where I call is a place which is I never lived before because my parents moved out when I went to university to other city. But still there is my home because my parents who are always on my side live there. In my case when I feel lonely and tired I recall my home. Then I feel reassured. For example usually when Korean gives parents a call they say I'm calling my home. The home means the place where is my family lives in. When I call my home my parents answer me. They always encourage me and give me a warm advice. Then I gain a power to make effort no matter how hard the study is. I really thanks to God to give me my home .
