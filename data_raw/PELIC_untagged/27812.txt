Law of drinking alcohol in the U. S. The law is organizer for all of kind of lives such as social life working life political organizations and relationships between the countries . Etc. That how did make the life to continue as straight so each country tries to make the best laws for its community and they must be matching with the traditions or costumes . As drinking alcohol is important behavior for most communities. The drinks became a part of life style for many people. The governments must make a rigorous system over the alcohol users. Where are no benefits drinking alcohol. Include awareness the rigorous law of alcohol considers another way to reduce the drinkers and smokers too or I can say all of bad behaviors which bring our health down. In the united state where I live now has a law for each thing as same as others. I see how the laws organize the social life system. The law of the United state in my mind considered crucial strong and flexible with the same time. Even alcohol has a strong rules to follow it. For example when you can drink alcohol where you can drink it what is the allowed limit of alcohol in blood to able to drive a car. The current age to drinking alcohol is 21 but some people think about it to make the current age lowered from 21 to 18. There are the some agree with that and others disagree. In my mind I'm with the second team who say disagree for several reasons such as the guy both sex who is 18 years old is still teenager in that age usually is the beginning of university and they are not aware what alcohol does make for their health.
