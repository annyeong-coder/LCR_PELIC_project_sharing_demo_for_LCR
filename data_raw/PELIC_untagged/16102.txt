Last night I saw a TV show it describe two contestants have a competition in the desert island. In my opinion I think They should bring the knife it could be used to cut down something. Also they need bring some water because in the desert that must very dry they need water to drink. Lastly I think they also might need a good shoes that can protect the foot. In the desert must have lots of small animals. So I think they must need all of this.
