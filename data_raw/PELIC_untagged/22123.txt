First of all my name is ANON_NAME_0. This month I'm studying English as second language in USA. Every morning I wake up at 5 o'clock and take a quick shower. I have 5 classes every day except Wednesday. My teacher is teaching grammar level 4 and writing level 3 as well. He prepares himself and organizes his materials before the class. I'm interesting to know how to speak English very well. I and my friend Macgel participate in the activity of our school. Nowadays I'm planning to travel to Washington DC to visit my friends. Because I live away from my family my mother calls me 2 times every week.
