My major is clinical immunology and I was studying in the king ANON_NAME_0 University in Saudi Arabia. One day while I was waiting in a line to have my breakfast somebody asked me do you know who am I I told him unfortunately I don't know you. He smiled and told me wow you lost your childhood memory and he was laughing. One of my friends was waiting with me told me his name. I remembered him but I felt shame because I forgot him. He was my best friend in the elementary school. After that he invited me to his home and I came over to him when his mother was cooking the dinner. Finally I took his cell phone number and email and we still on contact.
