My Writing Habits When I want to write something I have to make the place suitable for writing. For example the lighting must be soft the place must be clean warm and very quiet because I don't like a noisy place. When I start writing I don't like anything to interrupt me. Usually I can write any time of the day. I prefer that all my tools are near me like a pencil a pen and a note book. I like something to drink. For instance coffee tea or cola. These are my writing habits.
