It seems like snow Some poem said when I am in this place I feels cozy. Second I could eat many types of food because wheat is used as basic ingredient of food. For example As how to use an wheat a cooker can make nuddle bread pizza and others food. For this reason I was able to try all of wheat foods at this place and I was happy. Korea food reseach center announced An Wheat has much nutrious atom it helps us being helthy. On top of that there are a lot of vally to enjoy vacation. When I went to there it was summer. So then I could swim on vally because a vally has many water that was very cold. And I was able to forget hot weathet I even thank winter. Finally while I was in Bong Pyoung I stayed fension.
