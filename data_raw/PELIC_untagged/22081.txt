The difference of language between non human primate and human is that non human primate cannot speak and they cannot create a language by themselves. However non human primate has the ability of understanding and learning like humans. The gorilla Koko started learning sign language after she was born in 1971. Through Koko's ability of understanding and imitation she is able to use and understand more than 1 000 signs. She can also understand thousands of words of spoken English. Koko demonstrates that non human primate has the capability to learn how to express their minds and emotions using sign language. Furthermore Koko can express her emotion through painting. Some of her paintings express an object like a cat or a bird and some of her paintings express the emotions like anger or happiness. Through these examples we can see non human primate has the communication capabilities similar to humans' namely they can express their minds and emotions clearly and communicate with other humans.
