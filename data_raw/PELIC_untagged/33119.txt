Two months ago I decided to make this semester better than the previous one. So I thought about different plan to help me to get the result that I want. According to that I have changed many things. I have been sleeping early every day which I have not been doing for along time. So I have been more relaxed in my classes and when I do my homework. Also I have been studying and doing my homework everyday in enough time to get them done well. Since the beginning of this semester I have not wasted my time on doing nothing or on anything before I finish my homework. Now it has been two months since this semester has started and I have made a big difference. I think it is a good decision that has helped me to get a better result. Really I have been improving my studying skills and I liked that.
