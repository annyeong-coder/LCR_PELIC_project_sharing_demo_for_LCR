Dear MinWook How do you feel today Recently I think that I'm going to buy video game. But I have decided yet. So after you read my message please E mail me about your opinion. If I have enough money I really want to buy video game. But it's expensive. So before I buy the game I should compare games. You know that there are two big game companies in the world. They are Play Station 3 which is made in Sony and X Box 360 which is made in Micro Soft. First of all cost is very important me. Play Station 3 is more expensive than X Box 360 . Actually Play Station 3 is about 700. On the other hand X Box 360 is just 400. If I consider the cost of course I will buy X Box 360 . But you know that Play Station 3 has excellent graphic. It's better than X Box 360 . In addition Many game CD companies follow the Sony such as God of war Final Fantasy and other games. Of course other game CD companies also follow the MS . But they aren't my interesting. Now I actually want to buy Play Station 3 . Because graphic and game CD that is my interesting are more important than cost. But I'm wondering now. I really want to your opinion. Please E mail me after check this message. I will wait your massage. Good bye Your best friend
