My ideal neighbor would be someone who is helpful. Basically someone who is considerate of me and just a generally cheerful person. He doesn't make loudly noise. When we have a problem he supports me seriously. I always truat him because he is reliable. He talks politely when we discuss the issue. My next door neighbor is a really nice man.
