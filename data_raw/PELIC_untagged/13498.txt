I am a travel agent. If you have a dream vacation in space many things we will do. We will talke to the people at NASA and sometimes we can talk to our families. There is no night or day in space. When we are going to sleep. We will sleep in special sleeping bags. We can play cards read books or can go for a spacewalk. We will see rock and some things shying such as starts in space. We will feel very exciting . We can eat any thing but we are going to exercises to stay fit in zero gravity. I like my job because it is a very interesting job and space is very beautiful.
