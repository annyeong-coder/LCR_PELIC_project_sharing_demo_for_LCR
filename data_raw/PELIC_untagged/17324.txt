I was came Pittsburgh in December last year. The first week in Pittsburgh was terrible for me. This was the first time I came to USA I lived with my friend about one month. The weather in December was very cold. I came from Thailand in my country the weather almost hot. The first week in here I could not stay outside the room because it very cold. But after that I could stay in here. I think the first week in here it was terrible week for me.
