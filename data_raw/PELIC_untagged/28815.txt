After finishing high school everyone I apply for the universities. The students who finish the high school have different interest in different universities and majors. For me I decided to be in English Translation. Having good grades in English helps me to be in this major. King ANON_NAME_0 University in which I was studying is the only university that have this major. Being study in this university was crucial for me to have a good job. I did not choose this major arbitrary. I had a lot of acknowledgment about what I will study. At first time the major was ambiguous until I read more about it. Being in this major was attribute for me to get a good job. English is not inherent only for the people who live in countries that first language is English. My major that I already changed it was English translation. Being translator is a good job for me. But I changed for some reasons. While studying English I got a scholarship. So I decided to change my major. United States where the people speak English was my target. United States universities offers more different majors which the universities in my country do not provide for us. Studying English in United States makes me to change my decision in Eng. My parents who are in my country right now support me. The second major which I will study it is Business Administration.
