My hometown where I grew up is in a very small rural area in the south of Korea. My friends and I spent lots of time in a brook which is in the middle of the town. There is a huge field too. This field where we played mostly was the best place to fly a kite. My uncle who still lives there was a master of making kites in the town. Our best season to play was harvest time and winter. We loved harvest time which is the busiest season for farmers and enjoyed the food from the crops. We played in the field where the farmers had finished their harvest and burned the leftover straw. This field where we had great times changes in winter. When we had snow we made a sled and rode in the field. In the snow we made snowballs and built a snowman. I think of my hometown when I feel depressed. My hometown is the place where I want to live after retirement.
