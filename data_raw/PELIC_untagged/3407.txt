According to the author an ideal education setting would like totally different as is today. First of all an ideal education should be without grades. For that reason I think a good idea could be that each kid grades her his work. If they evaluate their own work they can notice if they are right or wrong without feeling worry about how others judge what they are doing as the author states in the passage. Second teachers and parents should give kids more freedom and permit them to play or do activities that they really enjoy. As a consequence kids will develop their creativity originality and skills. Third education should be not only knowledge but also recreation and fun activities for kids. As a consequence the ideal education should integrate the principal areas of knowledge such as math science etc. With activities that permit kids to learn faster and not traumatically. Finally parents and teachers should leave kids to manage their own time parents could provide them a big schedule and post it in the wall of the kid's room. Therefore children can establish their activities and control their own time. In conclusion and according to the author ideas I think that an ideal education setting will be less strict and more flexible and fun. Teachers and parents should understand that is more easy to children learn while they are playing than learn when they are worried.
