Being a teacher is a beautiful career but very difficult to carry out. All teachers have a complicated mission that is to cooperate with the future of the nation that is children or young people. Ironically teachers do not a good wages and the opportunities to increase their salary are slim. Many characteristics can be exhibited for a good teacher. However there are two principal features to be an outstanding teacher such as pedagogy and the academic background. The excellent teaching is based on the good skills that the teachers can apply within a classroom. Indeed my mathematic teacher in high school had a good pedagogy. His teaching encouraged me to adapt his skills when I am teaching. . My teacher said that the pedagogy is not an easy to learn based on books or theories. It is necessary to live many experiences within a classroom with different students with several conflicts in their life. Each student is as a different world with particular conflicts and difficult. Additionally not all students can have the same speed to learn in the every subject. Therefore the success of teacher starts in the good teaching strategies to transmit the knowledge. Thus if the teacher is focus on the knowledge and not in the way to transmit this knowledge the probability to fail is high. Another important characteristic is the good academic background. My chemistry professor in the university has an admirable background. It encourage me to think to apply to Ph. D programs. Every teacher is responsible to be updated since sciences and technologies are advancing daily. Thereby renewing the knowledge can guarantee a good teaching for students and excellent prestigious in the curriculum vitae of teachers. Hence many universities offer master or doctorates programs for teachers. Finally both features pedagogy and academic background are crucial for a teacher.
