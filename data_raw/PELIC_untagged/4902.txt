Einstein is regarded as one of great scientists in the world. He influenced the history of Physics. For example 'E MC2' was made by him and since it was thought to be correct to apply for studying it has been used not only Physics but also other studies which are related to the field of Physics. People in my contry say that he is considered as a genius and it's hard to fine someone like him in the future.
