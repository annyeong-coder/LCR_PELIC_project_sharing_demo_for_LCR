I went to Busan last summer vacation with my friends. I played in the water in Hae woon dea beach and then I took pictures. After I played I went to Ja gal ci market and ate sushi for dinner. Next day I went to Busan museum admisstion was very high but relics was little. I saw gwangan large bridge at night. Night view was very wanderful. And I got on aboard a ship that I was looking around hae woon to oruck do. I saw many islets. It was very wonderful. It was a shot period of trip but I was feel like it was along trip and I became a close friend So we promoted friendship advance a friendly feeling. It was good trip
