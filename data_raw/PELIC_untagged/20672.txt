Parents are sometimes skeptical about their children especially when it comes to their careers and their partner. My mother who is a teacher tried to transform my opinion in my career because she thought that my decision of choosing medicine as a final destination was arbitrary. However I acknowledge that I will do very well in medicine because I love it to the extent that I sometimes dream about it. The other decision that my mother tried to manipulate was my beloved girl who I will marry in the next future. L love girl who works as a dermatologist in Libya. But my mother tried many times to change my mind because she thought that a female doctor cannot be a good house wife because her perspective in life is not parallel with what I have. After that all I went with what I liked and my mother now is very happy with my decisions and she always says for every time period there is different style of life and one should always have a wide mind and wide perspectives
