The definition of friend is someone who gives you suggestions or helps you when you face the problems so friends are crucial for me. I can't live alone without friends because I need friends who can accompany me when I feel gloomy or sad. Also they can help me when I get into troubles that I can't handle by myself. My best friend whose name is Shiko is also studying in Pittsburgh but he is going to go back to my country which I miss so much now. He gave me a lot of assistants since I came to Pittsburgh which has many rivers and bridges. Prior to moving to North Oakland where my apartment is located I lived with him and his wife. Then he helped me look for the apartment and move to my apartment. We live apart now but we still keep in touch frequently through e mails or phone calls. I have known him for ten years. I met him when I was a freshman in the university which is located in a windy city of Taiwan. His major was different from mine but we had the same hobbies which are playing billiards watching baseball games and drinking beer. At that time we talked about the future and encouraged each other. I can't believe that we are studying together in the U. S after graduating from the university. We plan to work together in Taiwan after I graduate from the graduate school to which I am applying now. I believe that he is my best friend in my entire life.
