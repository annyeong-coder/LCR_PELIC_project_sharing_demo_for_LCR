Yes I would like to live a nontraditional life. First of all I'm traditional person in my value but sometime there is traditional issue I would like to change it. I believe in equal right for everyone whatever their gender but traditional life makes the woman's right uneasy. I would like to withdraw that thought about set woman apart from political position. A nontraditional life gives us opportunity to be more creative and productive rather than following the same way or pattern. For example woman's drive rejects by the community. Moreover today the women freedom is disturbing by some traditional law. Furthermore a nontraditional life changes the rhythm and pattern of following the same sequence and explores how people is thinking. A nontraditional life serves as formidable challenge.
