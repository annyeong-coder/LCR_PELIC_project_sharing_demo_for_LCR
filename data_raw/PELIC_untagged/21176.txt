Before going to high school I wanted to be a surgeon but my grade was not enough to go medical school. I was so frustrated as I didn't get a goal. After I entered university I decided to get a great grade. However I didn't make it beacause I was so lazy. When finishing the sophomore I decided to go military service. Despite the fact that I went through many fails I tried to get a high score in TOIEC during military service. Finally I got a good score. Now my goal is to be an accountant. It seems that very hard for me to succeed I will keep studing and make it.
