To lose an accent in the title of the book means to adjust in the new country and to behave and speak like a native and to change the old ways of thinking or evaluating things in which a person was used to. When compared to her mother Yolanda has lost her accent by not being convinced by her mother that it is better to be a happy nobody than a sad somebody. And some of Yo's poems talked about sex which her mother as a Old World woman did not notice or ascribed it to her daughter's imagination.
