The most exciting thing that has happened to me in Pittsburgh when I arrived to Pittsburgh's Airport my English language was weaker than now. For that I was confused and afraid about the way that I should do to deal with a new culture. But I was so happy to arrive to the USA and so excited to know new people and deal with them. However the police man on the border entrance gave me one application form to fill out that contains some information about me. After might be half an hour I filled out this application and gave it to him he asked me a strange question the question was is your father's name as similar as your name I answered him No it isn't. So he showed me that I filled out my father's name as my name so I told him sorry maybe I made a mistake then he told me is the application that you filled out for you or not I answered him sure it is mine so he told me then why you filled out your gender as a female. Really it was an exciting story out of my other stories and funny day in my life as well.
