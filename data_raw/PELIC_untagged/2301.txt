About 2 weeks ago I failed to pass my road test. Before I took the test I thought I have got a driver's license for thirteen years in Taiwan. I was supposed to be successful in it. I was confident about it and therefore did not prepare anything at all. Only one thing which I worried was my English skill. I was afraid that I can not realize what the examiner says. At the start of taking the test I drove slowly and carefully. I listened to the examiner carefully as well. At that time everything seemed good. When taking a parallel park I drove too fast because of my overconfidence so I could not park well. I failed the test. I regretted being that. I should not have driven so fast. If I have driven slowly I would have had chances to modify some. Also I ought to have practiced ahead. Next time I hope I can pass it. Before the test day I will have to have practiced the parallel park several times. When taking the test I will not worry about my English skill just focus on the driving because the examiner was nice last time. Moreover I should drive very carefully. I don't want to fail again.
