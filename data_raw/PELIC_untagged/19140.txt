When I had a vacation in the Philippines I had a chance to have a delicious meal that never met before. Food name is called pineapple fried rice. The recipe of this dish is very simple but delicious. One pineapple is divided into two and then inside of pineapple is removed for cooking. The bite sized pieces of pineapple is fried with shrimps and several vegetables. One order of pineapple fried rice is enough for two people to eat. When this food was put on the table its smell gave me an appetite. Bright yellowish color of pineapple is well adjusted with several colors of vegetables. Of course I was satisfied with its delicate taste. I still cannot forget this exotic food with unusual taste.
