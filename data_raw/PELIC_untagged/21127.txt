When I was a child I liked to visit my grandfather who is my father's father. His house is four floor which is spacious. There were plenty of relatives who lived in this house. I enjoyed playing with my cousins. Furthermore my grandfather liked us talking Taiwanese to him. I could not only have fun but also improve my Taiwanese when I visited my grandfather.
