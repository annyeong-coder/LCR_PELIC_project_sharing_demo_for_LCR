I'm happy to hear that you will come to America to study. Would you mind some advice Before arriving you should research some apartments. Also you should book a hotel online it's cheaper than checking in as a walk in . Maybe you should prepare more clothes from Hong ANON_NAME_0. Buying clothes here is expensive. Not to mention you will need to pay tax as well. The most important is to bring an electronic dictionary with you you will not be able to find any Chinese dictionary in here. In the first few days on arrival you may need to sleep a lot because you will have jetlag. After several days of apartment hunting you should select the one you like quickly. Because many students will be trying to find an apartment during August good apartments will go fast. After settling in you should take a look around living environment. You must know where to buy food and other stuff. You should settle down comfortable in your new life before your first day of school. Call me when you need help. I hope you will grow fond of living in US.
