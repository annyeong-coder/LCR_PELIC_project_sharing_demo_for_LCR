I met my best friend Dhaver while I was studying in high school. He was smart and he was the best student in Math class. I know that I would miss him when I came here. Before I came here we met and talked together at least four times a week. Last time I received a call from him while I was sleeping. I will try calling him next weekend. Yesterday I was going to call him but unfortunalety his cell phone out of service.
