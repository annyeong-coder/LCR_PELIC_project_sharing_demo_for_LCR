I have seen The Iron Man which was made from a comic book story. The Iron Man directed by Jon Favreau was released on 2 May 2008 in USA. The story is about a man Tony Stark who owns a weapon manufacturer the name of which is Stark industries. In addition Tony Stark who is the complete playboy happens to be a brilliant engineer. While demonstrating a new missile in Afghanistan he is captured by Afghanistan's terrorists. The terrorists force him to assemble new missiles which may be used against the US army. Instead of doing so Tony uses his engineering skills to build an armored suit which he uses to escape from his imprisonment. Back in the U. S. He announces his company will cease making weapons which makes reporters shocked. Later on Tony continues to develop his armored suit. By the mean time Obadiah Stane the second in command at his company has been selling Stark's weapons to the terrorists and developing his own armored suit. Equipped with his armored suit Tony returns to Afghanistan in order to destroy the weapons that were sold by Obadiah and the Afghanistan's terrorists. Eventually Tony stops Obadiah from misusing the armored suited technology.
