Before I come to the US I had an idea that American are active people and they love to have a healthy lifestyle. This was the most feature to me to come to the US. At my second day after arriving America I went the closet park to my apartment and lived this experience personally I watched for the first time a baseball game in that park. There are others popular sports in America that are different compared to the popular sports in Libya. The rules of the sports the places to play these games and why to play them are the biggest differences between the Popular sports in America and my own country
