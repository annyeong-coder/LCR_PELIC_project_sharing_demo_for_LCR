View of snow covered streets is beautiful but snowstorm brings several dangers for our life. To keep our safety and enjoy snow First heavy snow triggers power failure. Actually many houses suffered power failure this week. To avoid the influence of snow electric power companies have to maintain power supply equipment appropriately. However it is impossible to eliminate all of disasters caused by snow. Therefore it is important to have good communication between neighborhood residents. Good relationship enables us to coordinate and help each other in the case of a disaster. Especially if there are some elderly persons live in near your house taking care of them. Second bad road condition could cause serious accidents. Driving on freezing load is inherently dangerous for both drivers and pedestrians. Do not use your car without special necessity and stay home. Keep some equipment for snowplow to avoid rushing shop after snow. If you live in a house please remove snow from sidewalk in front of your house to avoid accidents of pedestrians. Your little effort makes many people happy.
