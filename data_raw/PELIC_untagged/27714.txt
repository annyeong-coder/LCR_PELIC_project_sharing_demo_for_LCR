When I got back home form school an inter my room I turn the light on. I find that I have to straighten up the room. So I start to discards the thing that need to change. First I start to put up the dirty cloth in the box so I could wish them later. I turn off my phone so I no one will bother me. My table was broking so I throw it away. My brother was knocking in my door so I let him comes in to help me. I told my brother to tear down down the tree from out side. Before my brother going out to put on his jacket. I hock up I new Wall clock in the wall. I turn in the adapter on cold. I took my bed and I turn it around the room. I was looking up for new bed in the internet.
