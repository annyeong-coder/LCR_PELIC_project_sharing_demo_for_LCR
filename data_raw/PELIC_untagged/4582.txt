Beautiful Han River The Capital of Korea is Seoul. It's very big and crowded city where 1 4 of the Koreans live. Han River flows across Seoul from the east to the west. Along the river there are many places to take a rest or to enjoy the scene. You can experience various sports beside or in the river and enjoy various gardens. In the night you can see beautiful night scent. As Seoul has so many houses and buildings you can see lights twinkled. And there are also many bridges along the river each of them is decorated with colorful lighting. Han River is very fantastic.
