I miss Hye sun Last Name she is my best friend. She was born on 7. 14. 1985. And I was born 6 days later. She was born in Seoul. She has 1 younger brother and 1 younger sister. We have been friends since we were high school students. I think she understands me deeply. And so do I. My house is close to her house. So we usually meet everyday. But now I can't meet her. Although She's still my best friend. So I miss her.
