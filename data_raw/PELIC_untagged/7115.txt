I have many friends who have diversity personality. Even though people want to meet a friend whose personality is similar or same I'd like to meet a friend who has different personality. For example my best friend Myung Kun differ with me about personality. He and I are always at odds about a little thing but we can make cover our faults by different personality. In my case if I met a friend who has a same personality with me I would be bored. Ey hun who is my roommate is also completely different from mine.
