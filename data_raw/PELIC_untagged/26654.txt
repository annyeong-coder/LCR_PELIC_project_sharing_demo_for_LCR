I am student at ELI studying English as second language. The main reason is to get the TOEFL score and apply for mechanical engineering it PITT. I should work hard to achieve my goal. I like almost every thing about cars soccer and fishing. I like to practice playing soccer everyday to sharpen my skills. Playing soccer need a lot of skills speed techniques and stamina. Also I need to obtain information about cars. So I will read articles about new cars and watch TV motoring shows.
