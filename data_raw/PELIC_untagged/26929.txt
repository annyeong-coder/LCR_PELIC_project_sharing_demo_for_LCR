I was working in hospital when I saw a beautiful cat in the parking. I took him with me to home despite I have been cleaning my home for two weeks. He was playing on my desk when I was reading my favorite books which I have bought them from United States. One day the cat pooped on my books while I was at work. Unfortainatly he pooped on my favorite book that I have read for one year. I tried to clean the shoot but no way. I went to used book store to find like that book. At first I saw a book and I remembered that book. I have seen it on TV but I tried to find it at many times but I could not. Hopefully I bought that book which I think that is much better than my book. Finally when I came back to home I bought a small gift to thanks my cat.
