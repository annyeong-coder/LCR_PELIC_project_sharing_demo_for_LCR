Now English is very popular in all of the world. There are many benefits of learning English such as finding a good job learning more culture of other countries. First of all if you can master English very well you may choose a big international company to work. For example in my country many seniors try to to find a good company before they graduate from the university. At this time the English level that you have will be a necessary condition for finding a good job. Actually not only in China in other Asian countries there is the same employment problem with English. Also you can learn some new culture of other countries through traveling many countries if you can speaking English well. Many people can speak English in Europe or other English speaking places. It is will be easy to communicate with the people of that country. Of course there are other benefits of learning English but these two things is very normal benefits in our life. Today more and more people start to learn English from so early age. I think we can not live this new century without learning English.
