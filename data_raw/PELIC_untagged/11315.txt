I like pizza because I can cook it easily also I'm able to buy anywhere. However it has different between Korean pizza and American pizza. First of all price is different. I feel that Korean pizza is cheaper than American pizza. In Pizza Hut a combination pizza in Korea is about 9 but it in American is about 13. Secondly American pizza have more types than Korean pizza. Because Korean like Korean pancake Kimchi ANON_NAME_0 more than pizza so we don't need many kinds of pizza. Third taste it's very important part. I'm Korean so Korean pizza is better than American pizza. It means Korean pizza taste just right to me. Finally American pizza look like more delicious than Korean pizza. I think Amerian value a decoration above everything else. In conclusion American pizza is as good as Korean pizza.
