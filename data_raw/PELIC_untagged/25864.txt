My partner was my husband after I lost my report sheet. He told me that his favorite way of wasting time was watching T. V . He announced to me that his plans for his next vacation were going back to our country. He reminded me of his best friend who he had known for twenty years and how he was a good man on whom he relied. He convince me to watch Sherlock Holmes because it was the last movie he had seen and recommended it. He admitted that he had used to play tennis when he had been younger. He said as usual he had not had any predictions about the future. He told me that he went to Giant Eagle every Saturday afternoon. He concluded that his biggest pet peeve is hamster.
