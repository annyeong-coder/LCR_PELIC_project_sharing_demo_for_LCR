Sports stars must earn rediculously saleries. However it's not enough money. Sports stars can play only 10 to 20 years. So They earn large money when they are players. Also they couldn't be a good player unless they don't practice a lots. So They must start to practice after they are 3 or 4 years old. About that they need to have a good coach and trainer if they want to achieve their objective. Money which they earn as a sports stars is not enough for them even though we feel they earn ridiculously large saleries.
