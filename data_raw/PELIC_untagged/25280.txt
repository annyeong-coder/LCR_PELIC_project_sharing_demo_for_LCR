Margot was in the closet wondering if she will see the sun in Venus. The children forgot and forgot the door of the class opened too. The closet was located in front of the door. So when the sun came out. The sunlight walked through the door like it was searching for the little Margot and found a hole in the closet. Then it moved through the hole to Margot. She became happy because at least she saw the sunlight again. And now the children believe her. When the children come back for Margot after they remember that she is in the closet. They found her sleeping with a smile in her face because she was dreaming of the sun and the day when she will go back to the earth.
