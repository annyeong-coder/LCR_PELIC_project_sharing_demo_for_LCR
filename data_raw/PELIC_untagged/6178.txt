I'm living in a nice apartment which is in a quiet residential area in Shadyside. There is a front yard and a lot of fireflies which are flying there cheer me up now. My bedroom has a fan on the ceiling. I use it during sleeping. It makes me feel good. There is no window in my kitchen. It keeps the fresh air out. It makes me feel bad. I'd like to reform there but I give it up because of renting an apartment.
