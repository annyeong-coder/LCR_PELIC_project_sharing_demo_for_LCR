My nice bedroom I have nice bedroom but I would love to modify my room to make it awesome. First I have to pick out a new bed that means I will throw the old one away. Second I will hang up some pictures that will be after touch up the paint. Also I think I have to clean up my room after finish that I know it will be kind of boring. Finally I hope to invite my friends to see my new room and give me some help to set up my computer. In conclusion I think after doing all of that it will become a beautiful room.
