CLASS Writing DATE 8. Oct. 2006 Writing Habits I do many things before I start to write. For example I take showier I eat something then I make my favorite tea I turn on the music or the TV because I like a relaxing environment for study after I do this activity I make outline to support my subject . Then I organize my idea and write it down.
