It happened when I still was an employee. In that morning I wish I had stayed in bed. However I had to go for work. After eating breakfast I drove to my office. There was a lot of traffic jams. I wish the street had not had many cars. When I reached the office my boss asked me to meet him. He asked me do an extra assignment which was due on next two days. At first there was something told me not to receive this assignment yet I thought if I did it well my boss would promote me easily. After that I went back to my desk for starting do this assignment. The phone rang. It was one of my customers. She got into a problem about my project which I just sent her yesterday. Moreover she wanted me to solve that problem immediately. I wish she had not called me. This problem ruined my plan. After I came back from the customer's office I resumed doing the assignment immediately because it was 5 PM. Now. If I had not gone to my customer's office I would have already done this assignment. Furthermore after I began doing the assignment my colleague remained me about the tomorrow presentation which I totally forgot and I did not prepare anything yet. Hence I realized that if only I would I had not received this assignment. However I had to forget my dinner and increased my pace. Until 4 AM. I finished all of my tasks. I was very exhausted. Next time if my boss gives me another extra assignment I will check my schedule first.
