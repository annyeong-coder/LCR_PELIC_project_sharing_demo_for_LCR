In treatment is a TV series which presents stories that take place in a therapist's office. The episode I saw was about a girl named Lura. In the session Lura was talking about a quarrel between her and her boyfriend Andrew she said that he gave her an ultimatum either they get married or they split up and she had to decided in two days which put her in front of serious dilemma. The whole session Lura was talking and Paul the therapist was listening. Then Paul asked her many questions which leaded Lura to confess her love for him. Finally the session was up and Lura left the room while Paul stayed alone thinking.
