Yes I can. First you must differentiate a common knowledge or fact from others' opinion. Second you must cite where the information is from if it is an opinion from others. . E. G. When I was a Ph. D student I asked for a plasmid from a German Lab to meet my research need. Before doing this I signed an agreement with the German professor who gave me the plasmid to promise this plasmid would be only used by me. I did. I never gave this plasmid to the third one. When I have my paper published I cited and acknowledged the professor in my paper.
