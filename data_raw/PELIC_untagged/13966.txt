Dear Members I Know that some of you are discouraged because it is taking you so long to run five miles. Don't give up yet please. I would like to give you an example a runner's five mile time during the first seven years. It takes the runner about 45 minutes to run five miles at the end of the first year. However the runner achieves the great decrease in the amount of time to run five miles at the end of the second year. In addition the time for the runner to run five miles decreases continuously during following 5 years. Finally it takes the runner about only 30. 6 Minutes to run five miles at the end of the eighth year. Therefore I convince you that if you don't give up and keep on running it doesn't take you so long to run five miles.
