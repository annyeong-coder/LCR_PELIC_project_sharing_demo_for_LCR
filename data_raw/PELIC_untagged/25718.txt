Most people state that sex is there favorite activity however a study showed that Americans spend only four minutes and three second daily in sex activity. The difference between male and female is not solely related to sex organs because in many animals that distinction is not clear. Males are usually physically bigger than females although biologists say that females have bigger sex cell. That variation in size between males and females is simply because of the competition between males to fertilize the females. However when both the male and female have to protect the offspring they have roughly the same size such as the penguins. Regarding humans the male is usually 50 larger than the female because scientists say there has been a male male competition in our revolutionary history.
