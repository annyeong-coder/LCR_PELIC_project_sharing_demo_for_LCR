Back to 2008 my brother and I were practicing karate all the time after getting done with our homework assignments. Thus the only thing that I was one of the international team of Kuwait and he is not. My brother and I were playing soccer outside suddenly instead of shooting the ball to him it hit my father's car and broke the window. I was shocked and terrified because if my father knew I would be grounded. Unfortunately my father heard the noise of the broken window and the car's alarm. He came outside and said what happened while I was hesitating in my speech I shocked that my brother jumped and said that he broke the window by mistake and covered me. And the fact that he covered me because he thought my father would ground me and I wouldn't practice karate with the international team due to many absences. I was surprised by the fact how my brother loves me and vice versa.
