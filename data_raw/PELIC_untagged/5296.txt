Dr. Schwartz's advice is very necessary and useful on these days Do spent time getting to know someone. Exchanging e mail before actually meeting. I think that viewing profile on internet or one time e mail exchange is enough to grasp someone before actually meeting. . Internet is just a way to meet someone for the first time. If you wrote a true profile and sincere e mail each other real meeting is more helpful and essential to make a solid relationship. Moreover if they just exchange e mails each other without real meeting they can tell a lie or overestimate themselves or the partner unnecessarily. Instead that meeting several times talking more time and giving a chance to each others can get better result.
