It was a rainy day in one of Pittsburgh roads. A man who had a bad day because he broke up with his wife wasn't concentrating on the road. While on the other lane of the road came another car that was driven by a woman. So the man was driving with a high speed and leaned on the other lane. While he was leaning on the other lane a car was coming on the opposite side and a woman was inside the car. The man concentrated very late so he crashed the woman car. The woman was so angry because she was very late for her appointment. On the side of the road they saw an old woman the man asked her Could you please call the police The woman replied Yes of course I will be happy to help you. When the police arrived the officer which seemed to be older went to the women and asked How did the accident happen the women said that it wasn't her fault the man leaned on her side. While the officer claimed that the man said that he leaned on the woman lane and hit her car. After few moments the press came and asked the old woman who called the police she reported that she didn't saw the accident clearly so she couldn't judge. After that the man went to the women and apologized for what happen and tell her that he will pay for the damage.
