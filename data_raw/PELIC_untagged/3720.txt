You SHOULDN'T CALL OFF the wedding. You COULD HAVE LEARNED to love David but you didn't try. So now you should try to love him. You SHOULDN'T HAVE MET any other man so just forget about James because if your family David and his family know that they are going to be disappointed as you know. If you really didn't like David you SHOULD HAVE REFUSED his proposing. You accepted so you MIGHT HAVE LOVED him. So you HAVE TO organize your mind and try to love David.
