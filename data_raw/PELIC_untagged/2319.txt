I and my wife traveled from Pittsburgh to Orlando last December. We have reserved package include flight hotel and rental car. It cost us around 220 per person. It was good deal for five days. When we arrived to Orlando we went to the renal car disk to receive my car. The renal car representative surprised me by saying that my reservation has been cancelled by the Priceline. When I called the company to clarify that they said that your reservation cancelled for can only with no reason. After that I asked for solution. She said that you could rent a car and they will return the amount of the car in package which is around 60 for five days. But when I ask about the price at rental Cars Company he said it cost you around 50 per day which is unfair for me and it was not my problem. Then I called them about the price and the representative said ok then you can rent car and we will pay the difference after you came back because it was our system mistake. She told me you should to give the rental number after you return the car. After I returned the car and went back to Pittsburgh I called them again to give them the rental number to get imbursement. Unfortunately they said this not our problem and I tried to convince them about the situation and you are the one who give these instructions. Despite all these explanations my effort was not work. I leaned from this situation that I should not to do any thing in the future without documents. It was my fault because I don't have document. I supposed to ask her to send the solution by email but that was not happened. Finally I decided to send email and explained the entire situation. The next day they send an email that they said they apologized about the problem and they will refund the difference.
