Opportunist might be a successful man but definitely not always. Success always belongs to those people who paid out efforts. I have a good example which is about Patrick's test can demonstrate it. Several days ago Patrick took his biology exam. He never studied for that and went to a party even at the preceding night before the exam so in the exam he had no idea at all about the questions. He did really worry about that. While students took the exam the instructor was reading a book. Since the exam was some multiple choice questions Patrick wanted to copy someone's answer. After Patrick glanced around the room he found he can see the answers on Mario's answer sheet which just next by him. Patrick hurriedly copied Mario's answer as soon as he wrote out them until the exam finished. The next workday the instructor returned the exams to the students. Patrick got an F but when he peeked at Mario's score he noticed that it was an A . After compared his answers to Mario's he found that the answers he had copied are all dislocated so none of them were correct.
