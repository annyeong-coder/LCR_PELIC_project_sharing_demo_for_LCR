In college students have many responsibilities and one of them is to understand the rules of the university. International students may be confused by some of these rules. For instances on most American college campuses alcohol consumption is prohibited because of the many alcohol related deaths among young people. Educators believe that students should be made aware of the dangers of excessive drinking. Another issue is smoking in public spaces which is permitted in some countries around the world. In the majority of American schools smoking is not allowed in cafeterias dormitories and student unions. However in most classrooms food and drinks may be consumed. Before students enter a classroom or lecture hall they are expected to turn their cell phones off. Plagiarism and cheating on exams are not tolerated serious consequences may result.
