When I woke up the next morning I was surprised to find that I had overslept and would be late for work. As I rushed down the stairs to eat a quick breakfast I tripped over my cat and had to hurry up. I rant into my car quickly but my car did not work so I had to walk to my company. I had just 30 minutes. I thought that I would be able to get my company if I run my best. While I was running I tripped over rocks again in the street. And unfortunately as soon as I stood up I was able to see demonstration against the government. That is why I could not go a regular way and had to make a good idea. On my way to work I decided to take a shortcut through an old part of town. I could feel relieved because I would be able to arrive at my company on time if I run into a shortcut. While I was running I thought that I was getting closer to my company and had enough time to get there. However as I was getting closer there I saw a familiar place. I realized that it was my house. I had run to reverse way to my company so I had to go back to right way to get there. As soon as I got there it was over 30 minutes when I saw my watch. When I arrived at work I found a note on my desk from my boss. She wanted to see me right away. I took deep breath and walked into her office. As I stepped inside I noticed a scowl on her face. Originally she is very punctual. She has never come to the company late. When I saw her face she seemed that she wanted to punch me. Eventually she started to tell me something. She told me. How long were you late today I answered. About 30 minutes She told me loudly again. If you were late again you would get fired. Keep in mind. Get out of here After she finished her sermon I returned my place in my company. Fortunately I finished my work well without being late so I was able to go back home.
