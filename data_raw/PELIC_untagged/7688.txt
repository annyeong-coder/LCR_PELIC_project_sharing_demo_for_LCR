In four seasons of a year L like the spring more than other three seasons. The spring is a green season because I like green color that symbolizes the living creatures. When the spring comes the snow begins to thaw the grass and tree are becoming green the swallow flies back and the duck swims in the lake. The spring is warmer than in the winter so the preasons start to work in the field and children could also go outside to play. It could bring you happiness. Especially it is important for chinese to have the Spring Festival during the spring in which all the Chinese celebrate each other do some interesting activities have much favorite food. Many people would make a one year plan to work. In a word I love the spring.
