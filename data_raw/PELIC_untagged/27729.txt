After I had arrived to USA I bought a t mobile line. As soon as I plugged the sim card into my cell phone I ran into a problem I had to call them back . I tried to call them but all the lines was busy so I found out that they had a bad customer service. At that moment I had thought I want to talk to the CEO over. I called him the secretary told me to hold on and she made me hold on for a long time so I end up with nothing. I finally gave up and hanged up the phone.
