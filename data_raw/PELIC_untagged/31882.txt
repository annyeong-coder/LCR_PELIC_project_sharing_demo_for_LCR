This class sounds interesting and the participants will defiantly learn from this experience a lot of things such as be patient and adjusts to changes. However I do not think I can participate in this class. Mostly because being a monk means no technology and my model life involves a lot of technology. I use it in my studies work and a way to contact my family and friends. Therefore it is not easy for me to let go of things that operate my life. Also the ability to be focused and absorbed in personal feeling and needs most of the days and not able to talk with friend is the most challenging matter in this experience.
