I grove up a city which name is Samsun. It is a nice city that is located northern Turkey Black Sea Coast. My parents and my older brother whom I love them a lot are living there. Until 18 years old I was living there which my parents still are living in. When I entered Istanbul University Faculty of Law I moved to Istanbul where is located western part of Turkey the Sea Of Marmara and my other brother is still living in. Before I came here to Pittsburgh I was living there. So I can say that both cities are my hometown. Istanbul is the biggest and commercial city in Turkey. Some people who doesn't know Ankara is the capital of Turkey think that Istanbul is the capital city of Turkey. That's because of Istanbul is the most well known and developed city in Turkey. Both cities which are located by the sea people like to live in.
