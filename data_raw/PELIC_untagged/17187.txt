graduation is next month I need to make some plans now because when exams start I will not have any free time . What am I going to do when I finish school my roommate is going to take a vacation before she looks for a job I can not do that because I need to earn some money soon . I think that after I graduate I am going to take a word processing class . As soon as I earn word processing I look for a job as a bilingual office assistant it is hard to find full time jobs though . Part time jobs are easier to find . Maybe I will take a part time job after I find a good full time one or maybe I will take a workshop in making decisions. Before I do anything
