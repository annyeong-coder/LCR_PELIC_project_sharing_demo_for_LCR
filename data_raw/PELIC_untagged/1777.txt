Cooking Habits In my opinion the food in my country is the freshest. Our country is very large and has different counties. Therefore these counties have some cooking habits similar and some cooking habits different. The most general food in my country is Kabssa rice and meat However I live in Madina which is in the west side of my country and our capital city Riyadh is in the middle of my country. So there are some habits similar and some are not. Here are some examples. First the soup in Madina is better than Riyadh. Second our food is more nutritious than Riyadh. Third their food is more expensive than ours. On the other hand there are some similar habits. Cooking beans in Madina is as flavorful as in Riyadh. In Madina we cook meat Mndey in a fire hall the same way in Riyadh. Their food isn't healthy as our food.
