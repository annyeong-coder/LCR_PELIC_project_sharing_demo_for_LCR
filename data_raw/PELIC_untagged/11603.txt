If I were going to start a business I would be INCLINED to start a different business not using an IDENTICAL way that she used and SUSTAINED. First I would look for a kind of business that would allow me to INTERVENE in the market safely. Also I would prefer some business that I could COORDINATE with my parents because they are knowledgeable in business. Then I would look for a competent NETWORK who could work with me in this project. I would agree with the ideas of helping poor people and about INCENTIVE the costumers to recycle packaging.
