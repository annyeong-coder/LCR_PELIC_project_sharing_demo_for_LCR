It will be difficult for widely used languages to defeat the dominance of English as long as their resistance to English is uncoordinated. Although the international organizations or conferences of widely used languages have been set up by the countries which share the same languages they have not enough cope with the cultural uniformity of English because each language has its own geographical sphere in which it is used with varying degrees of competence. However the total number of speakers of widely used languages surpasses the number of speakers for whom English is the official language so the widely used languages would make headway in international institutions if their resistance to English were backed by a concerted strategy.
