I love the rain itself. It refreshes my mind and gives me a time to think. Whenever it rains I feel calm and comfortable. Especially it's a good time when I'm sitting in a coffee house and watching the people outside or hearing the sound of raindrops with the music. If there is a book which I really like it couldn't be better. Also I like the movie Singing in the Rain What a great expression of rain! Besides Gene Kelly's performance in the rain was wonderful. In addition the rain has been used as a topic of a literature or music. That means there are many people who love rain like me. Here is a person who feels same way about the rain. Mikyung said The rain makes me somewhat blue but I enjoy that mood. This is exactly what I feel about the rain. But ANON_NAME_0 states that she doesn't like the rain because it gets her clothes wet and makes her cold. As well I Ling mentioned same feeling with ANON_NAME_0. Of course the rain gives different meanings to each person. In my case I like the sound of raindrops and the atmosphere. That is why I like the rain.
