Dear Concerned There are some of solutions you should do it. First of all you should think what happened late year. That is important to you. Next you had better speak with him but you have to know what time is better for him. The second important is you must speak with his friends such as what happen to Fred Or you should find his girlfriend and ask her to speak with him. She will give to him a good advice. After that you have to go to his teacher and tell her his about Fred. Maybe he loved someone. Also he didn't like you more. I hope you live the room and lets someone live with him. If he doesn't like that you should give him good things. Finally if he did bad things you should do good things. After that he has to thinking about you why you did like this. Advisor Good luck
