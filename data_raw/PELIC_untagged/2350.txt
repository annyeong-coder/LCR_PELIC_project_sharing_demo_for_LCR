Sleep is necessary to rest our mind and body. A good night of sleep is good for our health and skin. Most people need eight hours of sleep to recover after a stressful day. We may differ from each other about how many hours of sleep are necessary to recover after a long day. Even though some people need more than eight hours of sleep and others less than eight hours of sleep to recover themselves from a long day all of us need and feel better after a good night of sleep. I am the kind of person that needs at least seven hours of sleep to recover after a long day. Although sometimes it is difficult to get seven hours of sleep every night when I sleep less than seven hours I wake up the next day tired. Also I suffer from migraine headaches which makes sleep necessary to prevent migraine headaches the next day. So I try to not sleep less than seven hours per night.
