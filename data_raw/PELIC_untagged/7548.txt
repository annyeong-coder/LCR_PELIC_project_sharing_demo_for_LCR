First I did not like writing because I was never good on writing. I usually run out of an idea when I did writing. So I gave up. Until I have to take a TOEFL test. On this test it has writing part. So I have to start thinking about writing again. I always depress when I do it. Unfortunately I see a hope again when I am here ELI. I have a writing class. I think my writing skill is improved very much. May be it is because of activities in this class. I really like Free Writing activity and homeworks because they make me practice on writing. Even though I still think that I am not good but I am better than before. I see a potential improving my writing skill.
