I met my girlfriend while I was enjoying with my friend at a party. I never thought that I was able to meet any girl at that party because it was to crowded with my close friends and I had no time to talk with new friends. However while I was resting for a while from my friends I girl came to have a seat right next to me. We started to have an interesting conversation after we sat together. Unfortunately she had to go home when the time was 12 o'clock. We made an appointment to have lunch next time while I was thinking to go or not to go home.
