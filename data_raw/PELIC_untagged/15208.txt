Last week my family went to New York to celebrate my husband's birthday. His mother came from Russia to visit us so it was an excellent opportunity to make this celebration special. One of the reasons we wanted to go to New York was to attend the Metropolitan Opera performance with star soprano Anna Netrebko. She is a very famous opera singer originally from Russia who played Lucia in the Italian opera 'Lucia di Lammermoor' by Gaetano Donizetti. It was an outstanding performance that received a standing ovation at the end. I have never seen and heard anything like this before. It was simply unbelievable. The next day we went to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and spent their all day. In the evening we met with our friends and had a nice Birthday diner with Champaign gifts and many kind wishes. Unfortunately we could not stay more than a couple of days because I could not miss any of my ILI classes. But I hope that we will take another trip to New York soon. The city has so many interesting places I would like to visit.
