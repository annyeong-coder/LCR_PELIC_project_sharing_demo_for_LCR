First of all I would like to donate a little money to Unisef for a lot of children who are waiting for my help. And then I will invest some money in buying a few bonds and stocks. Because I don't have any experience about any investment I have to receive most advice from several professional fund managers. After that I would like to deposit the rest of money in a bank. Then I want to visit a couple of countries. Those countries should have a great many islands because I want to learn scuva diving. One of those countries is the Philippines. I will spend a great deal of time in seeing plenty of beautiful tropical fishes. Also I can experience lots of tropical fruits and several exotic foods. One more important thing is that I am free from a great deal of stress about money and that I have a chance to enjoy my life.
