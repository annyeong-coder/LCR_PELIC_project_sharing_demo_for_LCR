To make a weekend trip to another city we have to prepare some things. First of all I decide where to go. Then I check about the city. I have to know about Historic spot playground and well known products. Second I decide how to go there. I have to check how much it costs. After that I make a reservation for transportation. I also make a reservation for the hotel where I will stay. Finally I make a schedule of the trip. The time that I can stay is limited. So I have to use it efficiently. Good plans must bring us a priceless trip.
