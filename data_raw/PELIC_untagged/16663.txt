Introducing myself Good evening everyone! How are you Let me introduce myself. My name is Fen. Fen means a good smell from flowers. For me I am a good person you will like me to be your friend. Yes sometimes I am quiet but most time I am openning. When I have a trouble I'd like to go running outside by myself When I am working on something I don't like to talk with anybody The other time I'd like to chat have a party go shopping see a movie or plan tennis with my friends. Also I am very honest I am trustworthy. I hate that some people tell the secret told by a friend to the another and I never look into somebody's privacy. If you are looking for a talk partner please try me. And I am not a person who is easy to give up. I knew nothing about English when I came U. S. I have two boys they keep me busy I am not young anymore but I learn English word by word day by day. I already past the U. S. RN license test. Now I am studying English in the ELI at Pitt. I believe that someday my English will have a big jump. Ok let us make friends help each other happy each other. Have a good night!
