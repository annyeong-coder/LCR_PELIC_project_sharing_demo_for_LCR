Since I have grown up I always make important decisions by myself. The biggest one I had ever made is coming to USA. My husband came to America one month later after we got married. I would lose my job if I went to America with him. On the other hand some of my friends said to me that if I didn't go with him maybe I would lose him because of the long distance. At that time I thought my career was more important than my family and I was confident that our love would never been destroyed. So I decided to stay in China. But situation was not what I imagined. It was really hard for us being separated by the Pacific Ocean. We really missed each other very much. Sometimes I wished I could fly to him immediately. At last I made up my mind to go to USA even tough I would lose my job. Time passed so quickly that I have been in America for six months. If I hadn't come to USA I would still have worked in a hospital and might have improved my medical skill a lot. On the other hand if I hadn't made it I wouldn't have travelled to many wonderful American cities and wouldn't speak English much better than before and enjoy new life with my husband. Generally speaking I think I have made a correct decision.
