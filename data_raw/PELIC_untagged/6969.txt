There are two reasons why I like dogs. First the dog is a smart animal. When I was a kid I had three very lovely dogs. These were all kinds of Maltese. One day our family went on a summer vacation to my grandfather's house. So we asked my neighbor to feed our dog. When we came back we perceived that our dogs were lost missing. My neighbor said that our dogs disappeared when we went vacation. But at that minute our dogs appeared before my family. The fact was that our dog was waiting our family in invisible place. Second the dog is a faithful animal. One day a thief broke into my house. At that minute our dogs protected our family. In conclusion the dog is a friend of the people.
