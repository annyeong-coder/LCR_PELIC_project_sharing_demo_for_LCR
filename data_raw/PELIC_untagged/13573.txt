Two heads are better than one. My boss saved my employment. Last year in December I had gave a report for the company it was a countable report. I helped my boss to check the mistakes this report had one mistake. If my boss didn't detect this mistake I wouldn't continue in the company so this mistake taught me to check the mistakes before I send the report. For this reason two heads are better than one.
