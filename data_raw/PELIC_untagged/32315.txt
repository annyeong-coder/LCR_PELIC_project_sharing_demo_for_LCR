In my opinion men are better parents than women. Women has the important roles in infant years however men is more important roles in the children's rest of their life. In modern society it is more and more important to achieve an individual's goal. Therefore people need role models and instructors for their feature. Although more and more women have had jobs and achieved their goals in society mens' role is still important. The reason is children learn the strength and logical thinking skills from their father. Also most of fathers have more jobs than mothers. So they can advice their children aptly. In addition children see how fathers deal with their problems and how they endure their difficulties. For these reasons men are better parents than women.
