I lived the first half of my live in small towns but also the second half in a big city. From my experience I can say that there are parallel situations between a big city and a small town. In a small town all the people are interesting in the local sport team just like in a big city. The services and transportation problems in both are the same. Not only in a big city is crucial a car but also in a small town to get access to the distant supermarkets. Of course there are differences In small towns you have better health weather and more nature compared with a big city. The big cities have more place to enjoy nevertheless is more funny a small city. You could have more friends in a big city though the friendship is stronger in a small town. Despite the facilities of the education in the big cities the underlaying causes of develop are the small town students.
