The authors are building an argument on Teresa's story which clearly proves that Teresa was interested in art at her early ages however unstudied method of teaching in some schools led to reluctant her interest in art. Teresa recalled I remembered going home every day after kindergarten and telling my mother I wanted to play with crayons I wanted to draw I wanted to paint which shows her interest in art. Teresa grew up and went to a strict school which adapts irrational methods of teaching. The method of teaching was irrational because it imposes children to make something impossible at that age Second graders being asked to copy da Vinci Teresa mentioned. The argument is obvious and the authors have clarified the problem according to Teresa's story. The authors have a good point because in Kuwait where I was born the educational system is not any different. The lack studies about teaching methods and the system of teaching needs to be improved. Students need to have space so they can create and develop. The lack of materials is a big problem that many schools in Kuwait have. Some teachers still use old strict methods of teaching. Some teachers do not accept arguments from students. Arguing and asking are considered important learning skills. All and All it is important as human beings to develop and to coordinate better schools and teaching methods for the raise of our nation.
