When was your creativity encouraged or killed In retrospect I was having lunch when I was in the elementary school. Somehow I heard the piano melody coming form the stereo. That was Dreaming Wedding this song triggered me to learn piano. After getting back home I was eager to ask my parents to let me learn the piano. So I got a piano tutor and a brand new piano in a month. When I play the piano I was engrossed in playing the melody reveals the feeling of mine. I had been playing for one more year. Because the study is getting heavy I was struggling to give up my hobby. The school and the exam deprived me from playing piano. Until now I still deaperate to pick this up again. I won't give my hobby up after settling down everything.
