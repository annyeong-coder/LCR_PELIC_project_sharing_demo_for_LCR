Before coming to the US I was working a loans analyst in a petrochemical company. If I hadn't came to the US I would be working as a loans analyst. If I had been working as a loans analyst I would be in charge of financing my company and its affiliates. If I hadn't resigned from the petrochemical company I might have been promoted to loans specials. If I had been promoted to loans specials position I would have done extra responsibilities than the loans specialist does. If I hadn't chosen the US to pursue my graduate study I would have chosen the UK. If I had selected the UK I would have easily gotten acceptance to graduate school. If I weren't in the US I would travel to Paris. I would have seen Eiffel tower if I had gone to Paris. I would have visited the Louvre museum if I had been in Paris. If I had visited Paris I would have stayed there for a week.
