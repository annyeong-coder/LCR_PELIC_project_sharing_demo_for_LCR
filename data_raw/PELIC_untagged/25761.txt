No I don't. Because I don't like a bad reaction when it tastes gross. Two weeks ago I was in a chinese restaurant with my friends and I tried a strange sauce for salad it was bad taste and I got rid of my salad plate. After this occurrent I decided to eat known plates and sauces. However sometimes I try to eat something new. For example I went to a mexican restaurant with my friend and we ordered Burrito sandwich although we didn't know it it was delicious and we often eat it when we go to a mexican restaurant.
