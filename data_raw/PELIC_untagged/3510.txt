March 24 2007 Dear my husband Honey I'm thinking about buying a new notebook. I searched for this information at the BestBuy online shopping mall. I found 2 attractive items. These are Sony VAIO and HP Pavilion. They are both priced at approximately 2 000. The Sony is 2 299 and the HP is 2 249. Also VAIO has a 1 year warranty and Pavilion has a warranty 1 year too. Furthermore Sony is smaller than HP. Sony has 11. 1 Screen size and its weight is just 2. 8 Lbs. It is perfect for carrying. On the other hand the screen size of HP is 17 and its weight is 7. 7 Lbs. This is too heavy to bring but it is good to watch the movies. Finally HP Pavilion has better performance than Sony VAIO. Sony VAIO has Intel Centrino 1. 33GHz and HP Pavilion has Intel Core 2 Duo Moble 2. 0GHz. However I think it is nothing but a number. I couldn't feel a difference in the performance between the Sony and the HP. All things considered I will choose the Sony VAIO notebook. That's because it isn't heavy to carry and I don't need much performance. I'll use this notebook searching the Internet or doing word processing. I want to hear your opinion for my choice. Love
