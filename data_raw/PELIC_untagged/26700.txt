It is important to me that I meet new people so I always find someone who is very kind and has good sense of humor. When I met someone I tried to talk each other to know his her personality. If they were kind or enthusiastic that I felt I would tried to meet them again. While I was hanging out with them I asked them to know their information that they have taken such as what they have had hobbies what they have been interested in. I strived for maintiang our relationship.
