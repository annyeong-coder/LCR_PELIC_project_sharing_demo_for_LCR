The banality of evil as the entire article that we read in class reminds me something that I read when I was at the High School. The meaning was the same the general topic was the same but the author was different. The text that I read at the High School was an excerpt from a book of Hanna Arendt and it was related to the genocide of the Jews during the WWII. In that book as in this article any reader can face how easy should have been to stop the evil anyone can give a suggestion of how banal should have been to avoid that an atrocity could happen but for every reader the great question that eliminates any certainty is why no one took a side against the evil Maybe more disrupting was and is the answer that people involved in those situations gave as a rationalization of their behaviors. In some cases it was easy for them to recognize the evil but in the experiment as in the history the respect of the authority implied a certain way of acting. This fact continues to make me feel puzzled. The literal meaning of the phrase is the obviousness of evil and it sounds strange or quite unusual because generally we don't think that evil could be banal. We think or maybe we prefer to think that behind evil there are reasons purposes theories etc. . . . However after a quick look at the history book or at The Milgram Experiment could be easier to understand how it can be possible that behind the evil sometimes there are common people who are banal because without any special characteristics or abnormal features that can explain a particular behavior. I hope that the understanding that everyone could be able to do the same things that had already happened will prevent us to be actors in the banality of evil and will prevent our society from a repetition of something that marked so badly all the human kind.
