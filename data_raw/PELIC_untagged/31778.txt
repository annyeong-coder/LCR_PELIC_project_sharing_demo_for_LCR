Mysteries are all around us. What fascinates someone in a story is the weirdness that covers the story. I remember a real story about a woman who was known as the Cemetery woman. This woman couldn't keep any of her husbands for unknown reason. All of her husbands died in a mystery way. Some of them died as a result of sickness others died of accidents. The weird thing in this story is that she didn't spend a year with any of her seven husbands. Everyone in her town thought that she was cursed that is why she couldn't spend a whole year with any of the late seven husbands. Also because she was a gorges woman she had the chance to remarry seven times after her first husband had died but this could not help her in her search for the true love. Moreover everyone who was in town was afraid of her. They thought that she was a death penalty. So they had decided to keep some distance from her if they wanted to save their lives. Having no husband to live with for the rest of her life left her an outsider and old woman.
