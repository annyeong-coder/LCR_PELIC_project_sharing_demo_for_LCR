EID Having an Islamic festival is an amazing experience. One of the most important festivals in the Islamic world is called Eid . It comes twice a year. The first one is named Eid Alfater which comes after the holy month Ramadan and the other is called Eid Aladha which comes before the end of the year. The Islamic festival needs a special preparation before during and after that day. First preparation for this festival begins around five or ten days before it. Schools are closed and work is stopped before that day. Initially all family members go shopping to buy new clothes. Also parents buy sweets cakes and plenty of toys for their children. To get ready for this celebration on the night before Eid houses are cleaned and decorated and special food is prepared. Secondly during that day people do a lot of things. They start that day by praying in the early morning. Then they have breakfast with their families. After that they visit their relatives and all families meet each other in large groups and eat lunch together. On that day people do good activities for example they visit patients in the hospitals and help poor. Moreover children spend all the day in the playgrounds. Finally after this festival relatives are close together more than other days. In addition people remember their ancestors so some of them go to the old villages where their ancestors are living to celebrate with them. Also the poor are happy because they get gifts and sometimes money. On our Eid if you prepare well you can enjoy yourself by doing great work in different methods. It is a tremendous celebration because it reunites people all around the country. I hope that you have a chance to experience this day in Saudi Arabia.
