WHEN I WAS A CHILD I WAS SO INTERESTED IN MAKING THINGS USING COCONUT FIBERS. I ENJOYED VERY MUCH IN MAKING CUTE THINGS USING IT. MY TEACHER ALSO ENCOURAGED ME TO INCREASE MY ABILITY. I WAS SO EXPERT IN USING THAT KINDS OF THINGS AS A CHILD. WHEN I GREW UP I TRIED TO MARGINALIZE MANY THINGS THAT WERE SO INTERESTED WHEN I WAS SMALL. MY CREATIVITY USING COCONUT FIBERS ALSO PARTIALLY LOST AS A CONSEQUENCE.
