I think the English Language Institute ELI is a good choice for students who want to study English as a foreign language. First there are many options and events that we can enjoy using English. It will give you many chances to make friends and communicate in English. As you know from the graph the number of events has increased every semester since Fall of 2007. Second people from over 14countries learn in the ELI. We have lots of opportunities to learn other cultures and also explain own culture. It is very interesting. I think it makes us motivated. I think we can study things for English skills more than other schools commented Gajin ANON_NAME_0 who studied in the ELI last semester. Moreover we have many teachers who assist our improvement. According to the graph 14. 67 Percent of students take only one course. It means it is worth it to take even only one course. I think the ELI gives us not only English skills but also a good experience.
