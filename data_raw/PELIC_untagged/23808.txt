My experience with the food in America is that the most of the american people eat a lot of fast food or convenience food. I have noticed that they eat a lot this kind of food because of different reasons. One of those is because they dont have enough time while they are working but in home the most of the american people eat convenience food. When I go to buy something on the supermarket I see that that the most of the food is ready to eat or ready to heat it on the microwave. In colombia we dont have these kind of food I mean that obviously there are convenience food but no in large number as here. In colombia in my home every day someone cooks and just a few weekends we eat fast food. I think that is not true that all the americans cannot cook. I think its just that they dont cook every day as some people do in other countries and that they buy a lot of things ready to eat and thats the reason why they are categorize like people who dont know how to cook. I know americans that can cook and there are one that loves cook and he cooks really good. He doesnt cook during the week he just cook on sunday but he know how to do and he loves it.
