Yueh ANON_NAME_0 ANON_NAME_1 said We have to have stereotypes to deal with so much information in a world with which we are often uncertain and unfamiliar. I personally don't agree with ANON_NAME_1. I have gone through difficulties of stereotypes. I am studying English with many international students who are from lots of countries. Many Koreans have stereotypes for the Middle East people because some koreans were killed by them. We think all of them are terrorist. When I first saw them I was so afraid of everything about them. I didn't even want to talk with them. Now I know they are not bad as I thought I feel better than ever. However I still have some difficulties for accepting everything such as their particular culture food habits. As a result of stereotypes I still don't adapt to many things about them. If I don't have stereotypes I don't have many difficulties for understanding them.
