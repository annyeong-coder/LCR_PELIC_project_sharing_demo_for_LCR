Minority languages will continue to exist in the future even though English and other major languages remain the most important languages in the world. According to Yale linguist Stephen Anderson English probably won't displace or abandon local languages because in most of the world multilingualism is the normal condition of people. Also according to Language researcher David Graddol the world's language system is rapidly restructuring and as many as 90 percent of the 6 000 or so languages spoken around the world may be doomed to extinction.
