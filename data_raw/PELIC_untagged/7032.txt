In German there is a proverb about friends that is Friendship is a plant which we must often water. It is difficult to understand the meaning of proverb which is written by foreign language. Is friendship a name of plant which grows in tropical zone The answer may be No. Did the stingy German who got lost in the desert and refuse to give his water to his friend lose his friend The answer may be No. In Japan there is a habit that we send a postcard at the beginning of the year to the people who have a relationship with us. The number of friends increases as one grows up. But it is difficult to keep contact to all friends every day. So sending a card is a good opportunity to confirm the friendship between the friends whom we seldom meet. About 10 or 15 years ago there was a friend to whom I keep contact only by this postcard. I had not met him for a long time. But we had felt the friendship with this postcard every year. Sadly I missed to send my postcard to him in one year. Since then we have never got into touch with each other. I learned from this event that the friendship should be grown up by keeping contact and expressing one's friendship each other.
