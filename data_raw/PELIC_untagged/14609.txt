Even though the future is a mysterious event for an individual should prepare a plan for it. I set up a plan for my future which will help me to achieve my targets and compatible to my ability. First once I finish my English course I'll get admitted to my program in the University of Pittsburgh. As soon as I finish my graduate studies in Physical Therapy I'll go back to my country and I'm going to get married. Then to continue my study I may change a country either Canada or Australia to study a PhD and when I finish my studies I'm going back to my country. I'll be the CEO of my hospital and I'll try to fix problems and promote the quality of the hospital. I might be the health minister and I'll find solutions to all kinds of problems in my ministry. I may not have time for my family but I'll try hard to provide a proper environment to rise up my children and provide my wife love and support as well. These are my plans for my future I wish if I could make it true.
