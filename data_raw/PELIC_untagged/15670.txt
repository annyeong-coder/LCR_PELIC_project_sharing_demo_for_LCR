Most of people were loving he because he was kind honest and patient with all people. Kaled had a artistic fighter. Actually he was analyzing all enemy's information and focusing about things which help he to winning before begin the battle. At one battle between his army and Romanian's army had 240. 000 Fighters and Kaled's army had 40. 000 Fighters. Finally he was winner because he had good ideas and clever plans for the fight. For example he changed the left side to right side and front to behind of the army and advised his fighters to take a shower every day. The enemy would think he had new fighters. Kaled was very intelligent leader. He didn't lose any battle during his life he was capable to be winner. He created the victory in worse condition. If he had competitive he will be winner.
