Taipei and Pittsburgh Living in a foreign country is usually a difficult thing . In the September 11 2006 I left my hometown Taipei Taiwan and came to the United States for studying English. Taipei and Pittsburgh are two cities that there are different and similar in some ways such as the weather the transportation and the food. In Taipei the weather is usually warm and sunny. Especially in Summer on July and August it is always as very hot as Pittsburgh. However Taipei's winter is not so cold and usually warm like spring. On the other hand the winter of Pittsburgh is so cold and often snowing. Before I came to the United States I went to work every day by subway. The transportation system is very fast and convenient in Taipei. In contrast I usually take bus to school in Pittsburgh. There is only a short distance subway in downtown Pittsburgh. Sometimes I was late to school because I missed bus or the bus out of the time schedule. I usually bought food outside anytime and anywhere I wanted in Taipei. I could find any food that I wanted to eat easily. This is very different from what I usually do in Pittsburgh. Unlike Taipei I can't buy the Taiwanese food easily in Pittsburgh. I usually cook by myself. However I can also find the fast food like Macdonld or KFC just like in Taipei. Although there are many differences between Taipei and Pittsburgh I still like the different way that I experienced. Also I hope I can getting better and better in the future.
