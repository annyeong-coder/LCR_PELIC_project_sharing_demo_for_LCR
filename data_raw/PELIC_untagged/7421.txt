Call them 'young people' 'learner' and 'pupil'. Sentiment is abundant. Effort with competition. What is a student I can give many categories of student definition. A student is somebody who is studying at school. Or a student is a child who is studying at a secondary school. Someone who is a student of a particular subject is interested in the subject and spends time for learning about it. The types of students have different meaning. First of all we can call them different words such as 'young people' 'leaner' 'pupil'. Young people are under age 13 to 28. And we can call them 'learner'. That's when they have duty to study and they have many exams for their grade evaluation. Therefore they have to learn to study. They spend all time for learning at school. Some people call them 'pupil' because that means they are not young but not yet adult. They are elementary middle high school people or special study people such as tutor of the artiste world. Second of all their sentiment is very abundant. They are very curiosity inquisitive and interest. I think that their emotion at first is out of curiosity. Also they take a fresh interest in life from friendship. And they enjoy learning new things. Such as sports meet new people and their study. They find interested in their major. Finally they are full of competitive spirit. Such as students who work hard get better grades than students who don't. They compete with each other for the grade or examination. They make every effort for everything such as studying or to playing. They are concerned to do everything. Also they should make effort to make progress for their future. My point is that all people had have be a student. Everyone goes through the experience of becoming a student. Student's problems or their situations are basically problems that all young people have as they grow up. They have many ambitions for their future.
