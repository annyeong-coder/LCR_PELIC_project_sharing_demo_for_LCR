I lay my rooms out in Asian style. Because I was facinated by Asian furniture when I lived in Indonesia. The ceiling of living room is higher than room which I lived in Japan. So I hung some Indonesian fabric on the wall. The wall was painted vivid pink. It's a kind of strong color for the room. I picked the color up because it cheers me up even during winter. I pick some lights up at IKEA to light the my room up. In Japan We don't need a lot of lights a room because we attach light at the ceiling it can light the whole room up. Japanese don't put on their shose at home. We sometimes sit down on the floor directly. So I made a place to which take off shose at the entrance. I'll pick up some plants when spring comes. I hope that plants makes me more comfortable.
