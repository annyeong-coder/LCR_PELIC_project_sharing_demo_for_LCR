I met my wife in our house when she and her family came to visit my family. I was sitting in the living room when she came to our house. We were young that time we got in love from the first meeting or from the first look. After that we were talking on the phone. Time by time we admired in each other. I did decide to get married from her then I spoke to my parents about her. They were happy and they agreed to got married especially we were young.
