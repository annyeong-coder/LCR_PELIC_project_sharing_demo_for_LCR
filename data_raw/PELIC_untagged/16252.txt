I was working at the fashion company as a merchandiser when I was in Japan. I liked my job because I had many business trips. From my stand point there is several benefit of having a job that requires a lot of travel. First of all I could visit new places without my money. Although l had a job I was excited because new places made me happy. Usually I didn't need to work all day so I could go to sightseeing. Another reason if I go to new places I could eat local food and alcohol. Especially in my country local food is completely different each places. I could enjoy eating these. Finally I will tell about the most important reason. The business trip can leave the stress. For example Sitting on the chair everyday is hard for me therefore I need to refresh for a change of pace. These are several benefit of business trip.
