Once I had a friend whose character was really similar to me. We had the same good aspects. We were the ones who could feel the pain and the joy of others. We were the ones who could keep the secrets. We were the ones who said only what we really thought. But we also had the same bad aspects. We were the ones who could not manage the money by ourselves. We were the ones who tended to put the things off.
