What I did last weekend was completely unforgettable. At the night on Friday I went to a bridegroom because the wedding was going to be on Saturday. Ryan who was the groom and two of my friends stayed together at that night. After we woke up at 8 O'clock we were busy to get ready to go to the wedding. In the wedding many people came to congratulate them to the church where the wedding was happening. It was very honorable time that Lori and Ryan became together from each other. They swear whatever something happen that they will love and respect each other. Then we had a wedding reception. We had special lunch together and some of us danced. My friend who stayed with me last night and I were clearing away when guests left. The time I spend with a lot of American for the wedding was amazingly terrific. I won't be able to forget what I did last weekend.
