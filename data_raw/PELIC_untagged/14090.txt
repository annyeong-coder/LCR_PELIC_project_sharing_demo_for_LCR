Topic Life in Pittsburgh It is a very happening city a lot of hustle and bustle in this town. It is major multicultural city in US. There are four main educational institutes in this city. Beautiful archeological buildings which are preserved in there original shapes and form. This city also has three big rivers which is unique. It is also claimed as city of bridges. On other hand the infra structure of this city is very old which is leading new problems and there are little chances of its improvement as compare to other urban cities. The number of shopping centers are very few in this city as compare to other cities. There is no major city nearby. If we want to travel in another city we need to fly because driving distances are too long. If I need to fly to my country I need to change 4 flights from here because there are no direct flights like New York and Chicago has.
