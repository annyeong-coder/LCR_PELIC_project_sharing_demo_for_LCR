I met my husband when he was working at the hospital. While he was doing an operation I first saw him. Then we started to work together. I had several opportunities to present my work at a congress when I was working at the hospital. Then he moved to another hospital and one year later I moved to that hospital too. We planned to get married while we were working at the second hospital. One year after the time that I moved to the hospital we got married. One year after we got married we had a child. I stopped working when I had my child. About one year after we had a child we came to Pittsburgh. When we decided to come to Pittsburgh my husband was working and I was not.
