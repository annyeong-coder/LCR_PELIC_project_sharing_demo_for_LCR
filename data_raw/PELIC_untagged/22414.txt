There are two things in my concept of the ideal parent. First the parent who believe their children whenever is the ideal parent. Any parents concern about their children and sometimes the concern can be changed into doubt about their children because their concern is to be big. Concern which is natural and helpful to take care of children has to be always with belief. Although it's impossible to be parents who don't have the doubt if anyone is parent they must endeavor not to have the doubt. Second the parent who can wait their children until they stand themselves is the ideal parent. Some parents overprotect their children not to get hurt. But hurt and failure are important things. The children whom parents don't overprotect can be strong for living themselves well. And they can be people who succeed without parent's help. Parents don't live together with children until all the time which they live in. I think waiting is more difficult than protecting children and is real love for children. Parent whose child can be ideal person might have belief and ability to wait for their child.
