There are many pressures for international students. I am also one of these students too. It makes me very hard to live in the United States of America. The three pressures are composed of weather money and language. Weather is pretty different from my country. It is hard for me to adjust to this situation. My country locates in tropical climate and I am used to be in hot weather. I just came here in last winter and it snowed everyday. I found that it is very cold and I had to wear many clothes so I denied going out from my apartment for many days. I really worry about money problem. I have to pay by myself and everything is more expensive than my country. For example I bought food in US for one week but I can pay the same price to by food for three weeks in my country. Before I buy something I have to assess my budget carefully. Language is the most pressure for me. First of all when I lived in my country I rarely used English. I just studied English in school or university after I finished class I did not use it in daily life. Moreover it is very difficult for me when I had a conversation with American people. I could not understand when they spoke because it is very fast and I had to think for a while before I spoke to them. In conclusion these are three things to make me under pressure. I hope that someday I can manage it or at least I am used to living among these problems.
