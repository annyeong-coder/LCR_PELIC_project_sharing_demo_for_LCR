Seeing decorated pumpkin angry or happy faces drawn on it is the symbol of Halloween. Halloween is a celebration that is celebrated in the USA. The way people celebrate Halloween is done through wearing special clothes giving candies and showing their clothes in streets. Wearing special clothes is the critical part of Halloween. People who celebrate Halloween usually try to wear special wired and exotic clothes and masks. Those clothes or masks usually belong to famous cartoons or movies characters. For example on Halloween day last year I saw people wearing Batman Dracula and Ninja customs. On Halloween day restaurants offer free snacks to any one walking in the streets. For instance last year I got free ice cream chocolate and a small cup of mocha on Halloween day. Streets on Halloween are crowded by people who walk from street to another. The purpose of touring in streets is to reveal their customs to other people in street and to have a conversation with other people in the streets. For example last year I had conversations with strangers who were revealing their customs in the streets. In the USA people celebrate Halloween by wearing special customs giving snacks and touring in the streets. People who plan to celebrate Halloween should wear an appropriate suitable and acceptable clothing and avoid wearing customs that might be insulting of offending to other people's feelings and sentiments.
