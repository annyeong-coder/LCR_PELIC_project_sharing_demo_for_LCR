After many movies that one have watched about Dracula one probably thinks that Dracula realy existed and it must has been a vampire who has killed a lot of people just for their blood so he can drink it. In reality it is an just a myth derived from a real story of a Romanian prince Vlad Tepes Vlad Dracul in romanian drac means devil also in romanian stake is teapa and Tepes is derived from teapa who has ordered that criminals and enemies should have been murdered by pulling them through a stake. Nowadays people think that story about Dracula The Vampire is true but actualy it is just a myth that was probably caused of that era which was a bloody one with a lot of wars and and lots of crimes. In that way his name Dracula was and stil is associated with a lot of blood and from that point it was easy to confuse him with a vampire. For someone who's been following the History Guide of Discovery Chanel that story is no longer a myth because on several times that myth was destroyed by their excellent documentary about Romanian history and particulary about that part of our history. For others who were curious about that mystery and read on the internet or in universal history books about it that part of Romanian history isn't a myth anymore either. It sounds like the myth of Dracula has been completely debunked however their may exist some proof of the contrary. Many visitors of Bran castle Dracula's ex residence reportedly claim they've heard strange noises and have even seen weird shadows or ghosts appearing in the dark. Experts on the matter weren't able neither to confirm nor infirm this mystery. As someone of scientifical formation I think we should solve this mystery rather soon and forever be done with it.
