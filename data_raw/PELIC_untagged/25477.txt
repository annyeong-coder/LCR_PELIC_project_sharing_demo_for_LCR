Last year I saw an accident in the street. That day I was going to school to take an exam. I was sitting in our car while my mom was driving the car. I heard a loud noise. The accident was between a car and a motorcycle. The motorist was hurt seriously. When the ambulance and police arrived he was bleeding from his head. Unfortunaetly I was taking the test when he died.
