One of the happiest moments in my life is when I met my girlfriend. I met her in my cousin birthday party. I remember that when I saw here I couldn't take my eyes on her because she was gorgeous. So I asked my cousin to help me to hook her up. Also what I really think that makes her special is she came in the right time because at that time I was under so many pressures. She changed my life. And she keeps pushing me to achieve my goals.
