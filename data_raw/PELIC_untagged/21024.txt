I think Montreal is the most interesting city that I have ever visited because it is a beautiful city. It's located in the east of Canada. There are the most beautiful international airport and the most intertesting places. Also it is the most diverse city in Canada. It's the cleanest city that I have visited. Also it's the most modern city comparing to any city that I have visited but it isn't the biggest one. The people in Montreal have the most friendly relationships. And it's the safest city that I have seen. Finally I hope to visit Montreal again and have the most exciting trip.
