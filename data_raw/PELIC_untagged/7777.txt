Usually I can't figure out other people's odor type. But when I smell some of cologne I know I don't only notice the smell of the cologne but also find the odor type of the person who is wearing the cologne. Because I love some kinds of cologne and know very well about that so when I smell the colognes I can also distinguish that from other smells In this case that is 'people's odor type'. .
