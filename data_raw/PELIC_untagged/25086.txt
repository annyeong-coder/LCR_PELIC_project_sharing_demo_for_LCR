My best friend is Ann ANON_NAME_0. We were classmates when I was 4 years old in England. At first I didn't like her at all because she always copied what I did and no matter where I go she always wanted to go with me. Ann's mother and my mother are good friends and they were really worried about us. Because Ann and I argued with each other every time we met. So my mother came up with a good idea. My mother mad me to bring cookies to school everyday and share to Ann. If I don't share with Ann my mother won't give me cookies anymore. I still remember the first day I gave Ann my cookies I was very reluctant and angry. However Ann brought me some cookies next day. And we become very good friends because we ate cookies together. Ann and I back to Taiwan in same time and we never lose contact to each other. Althought we are in different school we often play together on weekend. And her mother and my mother are best friends too.
