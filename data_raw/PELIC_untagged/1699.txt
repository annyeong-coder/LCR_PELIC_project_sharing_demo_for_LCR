Two important areas of my life are my family and my friends. If I hadn't been born my father and my mother would have lost a good helper at home. My younger brother who was very dependent on me would have felt lonely if I hadn't been born in our family. However I think he might have been more independent and considerate if he hadn't had an older brother. My friends and I get along very well. If I hadn't been born in the world they would have lost a good friend to play with. If I hadn't been born I wouldn't have been the captain of our department's basketball team and they might not have won games as many as before. My close friends also liked to talk with me. They could not have had a good listener to talk to if I hadn't been born. Ann who has been my girlfriend for almost 4 years would have been very lonely and sad if she had never met me in her life and so would I. Therefore I think that it might be a blessing for my family and my friends that I was born in this world and I should treat them as well as possible.
