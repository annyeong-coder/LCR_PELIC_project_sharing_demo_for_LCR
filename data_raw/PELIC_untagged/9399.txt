Few months ago I was going to the university with my parents. The car was being driven by my father and we were in a long line when a car near us that was driven by an old man tried to join the line. At the other way a motorcycle was arriving at high speed. The old man obviously didn't see him because kept on going out with is car. The young man on the motorcycle tried to brake but the vehicle slid on the asphalt and the motorcyclist hit his chin against the car just in front of our eyes. The young man was near my window where he was carried by the motorcycle. I was so upset that I weren't unable to call the police. My father pulled over the car and called the ambulance. Five minutes later it arrived and the wonded man was taken to the hospital and the street was checked by the policemen. We couldn't have been told about what happened later to the ulucky motorcyclist.
