I was very surprised so I checked the location of Pittsburgh because I didn't know where it's located. Then I thought that I have to do some things. How I came to Pittsburgh Now I talk about it. Firstly my husband decided to work in Pittsburgh. I thought that it's chance for his career because experience in abroad is needed for him. I agreed with his plan. Secondly I arranged my job because I had to quit my job before going to Pittsburgh. I found someome who wokrs insdead of me in my office. I could find someome who works instead of me so I asked her to treat my patients. I didn't quit my job on last my working day so I sometimes miss my job now. Thirdly I applied for our visa and prepared to move. We made appointment for interview by Internet so we went to the U. S. Embacy. The interview was very simple for us because the interviewer only asked us basic questions which are our names jobs object for going to the U. S. . After going to the U. S. Embacy I prepared to move to Pittsburgh. In conclusion my husband decided to work in Pittsburgh. Then I arranged my job. After that I applied for the visa and prepared to move.
