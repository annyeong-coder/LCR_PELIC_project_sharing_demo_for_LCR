My name is Fadel AlJomaia. I come from Saudi Arabia. I am currently a student at the ELI and I am planning to study at the University of Pittsburgh. All my courses at the ELI start at 10 00 AM. I really enjoy being one of the students of Pitt. I usually take the Pitt Tunnel to arrive to the University. After finishing my studies at the ELI I am going to apply for my major in EMS. I am thinking of taking an advanced courses in my major since I'm at the intermediate level. I am hoping to succeed and achieve my goal.
