I am Joyce ANON_NAME_0 and I come from Taiwan. I love my name because it means happiness I also want to bring everyone gladness. I have a sister and she is studying in USA now. I am attending language school in Pittsburgh and I am living in a beautiful house at Squirrel hill. I am going to graduate school this Fall and I am very excited. In my leisure time I like to go shopping and watching movies. I have a lovely dog in Taiwan and I really miss her. I am always dreaming that I am running with her at a big park. I hope I can see her soon.
