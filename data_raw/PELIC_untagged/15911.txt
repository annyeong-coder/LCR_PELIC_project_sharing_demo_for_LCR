I have read the quote by Diane Arbus. I think it means that he likes to visit the countries in this world but he could not do it. I have the same feeling with him. I have visited some countries in my life. First I have visited Egypt a lot because Egypt is close to my country. It is a beautiful and I have done many activities there. Also I have visited Tunisia twice. It has a nice beach. Many people have recently been there. Finally I have never visited Australia China and Japan because they are faraway from my country. In conclusion I like to spend my free time to visit some countries in the world.
