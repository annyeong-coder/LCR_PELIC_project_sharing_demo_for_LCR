If you pay a little bit attention on different kinds of advertisement you will find they are rather humor. For example in my hometown on every seasonal sale I could see the words of poster Tiaolou Jia . The meaning of Tiaolou in English is to jump down from the top of a building. Jia means price. What is funny about this is the words including two meanings one of which refers the prices of merchandise sharply falling down. What is the other meaning What the other meaning is is that businessmen say that they almost want to jump down from the top of a building because the prices of their goods are discount greatly. This is a hyperbole. The fact that businessmen know that most shoppers love discounted goods and use those words to attract shoppers is their real purpose.
