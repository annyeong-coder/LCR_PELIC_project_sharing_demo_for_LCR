For my extensive reading I am currently reading The Broker written by John Grisham. This book tells the story of Joel Backman a lawyer who was once very powerful in Washington DC. At the beginning of the story Backman is in jail for a reason that we do not really know. At the same time the President who decided to put him in jail spends his last day in office. As a final decision he decided to release Backman from jail and send it to live in Italy. Backman who does not speak any word of Italian has to learn the language and act like an Italian to avoid being detected. The story unfolds on two levels and in parallel and in parallel with Backman adventures in the present time we also learn his past and why he was in jail. In fact he had discovered a secret satellite and got problems because of that. He is nowadays searched by people that we do not really know. T o conclude we can say that the story is pretty confusing at this point. However there is a lot of suspense and we will know everything at the end of the story.
