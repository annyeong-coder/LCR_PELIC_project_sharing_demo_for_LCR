A time when you ran out of money In fact that a money is the most important factor in this fast life. The money which I earned form my company was not quite enough for me because I lived far from my home town. The new city which I graduated and worked on it is expensive city compared with my home town. It looks like Paris or Hot city so to speak. This is one reason that I have few investments so far. Most of people who lived in that city have a similar point of view regarding money ran out. Every month I used to go shopping once I received my salary and purchase lots of thing. For example new shoes hot cologne and new clothes and so on which are considered unnecessary by a lot of people. One day after six months my Mother asked me a question she said my son how mach money do you have then I answered her Mother I have just 100. 00 In my saving a count . Then she stared yelling at me the entire day because I do not care about black day in her opinion and I ran out of my money for things that unnecessary. In fact her point of view is right because if I started saving my money I could have purchased my own apartment by now but I don't won't punish my self hard because I don't follow my Mother's a piece of advice. In conclusion parents' a piece of advice is considered as a treasure by the most of people if we follow it literally.
