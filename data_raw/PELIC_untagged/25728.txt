It is commen today to see a saudi student at any kind of English Inistiut in the U. S. . This can be seen mostly in the big cities such as Orlando New York Las Vigas San digo and Pittsburgh. When the Saudi student arrive to the U. S. He or she realize that there are many differences between the Saudi culture and the American culture such as food sports and the weather. Firstly many people know that Saudi Arbia is located in the middle East which has tremendous hot weather in the summer and moderate weather in the wintter . However the U. S. Has all kinds of weather even it doesn't matter if it is summer or wintter because in the summer it can be cold in the north. Also it can be hot in the wintter in south of the U. S. So it deppens on the area. It is obvious that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has a tirabul weather particulary in the last six months from each year. Secondly America has many different kind of sports such as America foot ball basketball and baisball in contrast Saudi Arabia just has one spprt which is soccer. This example clearly shows the different between the Saudi habit and the american habit in the sport area. It is clear that Americans like the soccer the least on the other hand Saudies like soccer the most. Theirdly while most of the Saudies prefer not to eat at resturants Americans love to eat and perefer to eat at any kind of resturant because it is faster than eating at home. This example clearly shows how fast is the America culture move even in their food whereas the Saudi culture search for the qualiti even in the food. It is obvious that there are many deffirences between the Saudi culture and the American culture. That's because Suadi Arabia and the U. S. Are located in defferent areas which cause the defferent weather. Also they have a lot of deffrences in the sport areas and in the food style.
