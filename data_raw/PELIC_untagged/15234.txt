Hi I'm ANON_NAME_0 Last Name . I'm from Saudi Arabia. I came to the USA to study English Language in August 2008. I've been living in Pittsburgh and studying English for six months. I've seen some international student's websites. Then I've decided to build my own website. I've been building this website for weeks. I've written my CV in this website and many aspects of my life. Also I've been posted many new pictures to show all my activities here in Pittsburgh. I've studied in England. So I've posted my pictures in England too. Last week my website reached 100 visitors. That made me so happy. Some of them are my friends. But most of them aren't. I'll develop my website to reach one million visitors as soon as possible.
