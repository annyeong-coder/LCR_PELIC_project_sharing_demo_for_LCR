The Pyramid of Egypt is still a mystery because of its massive size. The rock which ancient Egyptians used was not from where they lived. It is hard to believe that this marvelous structure was built 4 800 years ago. That time was before iron was found and there were no tools to build this structure. When people said some mysteries they often insisted that aliens built those mysterious structures. I watched a documentary which was the Pyramid of Egypt. Some researchers made a new theory which the Pyramid was not built by slaves. Because of the Nile River people were able to engage in farming. When the Nile overflowed people needed their new job and Pharaoh recruited them to build the Pyramid. It was surprised because I always believed that Pyramid was built by slaves. When I watched some adventure movie people got killed after the expedition to Pyramid. Pyramid's use is not found yet. Because people didn't find a real history of Pyramid yet they still made up some mysterious stories.
