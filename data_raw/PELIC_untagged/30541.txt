I would like to live a traditional lifestyle. That is because traditional lifestyle is full of social PARTICIPATION and activities and has less stress. In the other hand modern lifestyle encourages individualism and lacks relaxation and having LEISURE time. In a traditional lifestyle things are clear and simple. People value their relationships and things are less complicated. Modern lifestyle is UNEASY. There is more stress to achieve and less quality time with the family and friends. I wish that we could add those traditional lifestyle advantages into our modern lives.
