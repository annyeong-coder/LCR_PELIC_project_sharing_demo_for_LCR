Online education or class education Have you ever tried online education Despite the fact that there are many people who adopt the class room education there are others who prefer the online education. From my point of view the online education has both advantages and disadvantages. On the whole I firmly believe that the online education is the good innovation. First of all it is believed by some that online education is will be widespread in the future due to low cost. Moreover the online is considered more flexible than other. From these reasons you notice a lot of people are turning to this type of education. In addition lack of commute students who choose online education can save gas and commuting time. Furthermore there is more choice in online education. To illustrate this point take this example about some students which they live in small cities online education allows student to choose from variety of school and program not available in their area. Based on the example shown above it is clear why some people gravitate towards this point of view. On other hand some people claim that class room education is more effective way to learn. So the face to face class qualified to get obvious information from teacher. To certain extent it is true however I think online education benefits to life of education much. Also the class room education will cost people too much including cost of class teacher and facility services. To sum up even though the online education has limitations it has benefits which outweigh its drawbacks. I am sure that the future will be for online education. So I recommend that universities and educational organizations should improve their online system.
