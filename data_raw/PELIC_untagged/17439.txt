Creativity is an inherent state in the children. Eerily in the kindergarten the children are full creative because they can do what they want without strict rules or limited time. That also occurs in the preschool. However children when entire the school the freedom in creativity will be decrease as a result of increasing the control comparing with kindergarten. In fact there are some classes for fun and like art or sport but in this class children can't enjoy their own desires. They are forced to do the same thing that means all the students have to follow same instructors to draw same pictures for an example. Therefore they will lose their feeling about create some thing new and different from any one else. On other hand school should focus on learning besides the activities to achieve the education goals. Creativity and learning should occur at the same time at school. To illustrate students can create science projects ways to understand math problems addition subtract importantly they should enjoy all of that without feeling of excessive observations from their teacher. Consequently their desire to attended school everyday will incredibly increase and then learning which is our goal will occur.
