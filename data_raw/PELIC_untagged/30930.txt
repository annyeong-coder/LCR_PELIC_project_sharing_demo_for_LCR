In recent years people have shown interest in online education which has the potential of reaching a broader audience than traditional classes as well as lowering the costs of education. Despite the fact that both online and traditional face to face education can be used to teach the same contents several differences between the two modalities can be analyzed. Some differences are related to the characteristics of the class. For instance while a traditional class is scheduled at a certain time by the teacher or school online classes are scheduled by the student who can go online and review the class contents whenever he or she wants. Also in traditional learning the number of classmates a student has can affect his or her learning by increasing distractions for example. In contrast in online learning the class size is irrelevant because all the learning process is individual therefore a student could have five or a hundred classmates and he or her would not notice the difference. Others differences are related to the class activities. For example traditional classes usually include lectures individual work and team work whereas online classes lack of activities with classmates providing less social support for the learning experience. A similar difference can be found when analyzing the strategies students can use to study in the two modalities. Unlike students of a traditional classroom that are able to study individually or in groups students of online classes can only study alone. One would think that all these differences would have a strong impact in learning outcomes however it seems that both modalities succeed in their ability to teach contents to their students showing that people can learn in different ways.
