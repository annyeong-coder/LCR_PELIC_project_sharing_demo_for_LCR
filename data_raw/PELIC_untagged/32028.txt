It is better to eat bread in peace than cake in fear I realy believe that. Money and a lot of property are not everything. It is known that the money is an important reason to have a good life but it is not everything. Many rich people do not have a safe life. They usually feel in fear. Some of thim have problems with other people. Another maybe leave in a hospital. Because they could not treat. For example I remembered a rich man who spent two years in a hospital. He could not treat. Then he died. His money was not benefit for him. With these reasons that is why I believe this moral.
