I had never seen the snowstorm since 1993 one of my neighbors said and a parallel situation happened recently. During those days everyone in Pittsburgh was annoyed by this severe snowstorm. Some people inherently whined all day and complained the damages which caused by the snowstorm to everyone they knew and were reluctant to solve the problems but they also acknowledged that it is time to clear up everything and be prepared for next possible snowstorm. However the snowstorm caused a lot of dangers such as losing electricity being stocked on self home or running out of food but can not go shopping. Fortunately a lot of people still alive but they must try hard to keep themselves be safe. The most important thing that people should do is to stay warm. Everyone might have heater at home but some area's electronic equipment were broken because of the snowstorm so people's heaters didn't work anymore they must cover themselves by more clothes and just keep warm or buy a backup and stable machine which can generate electricity in advance. On the other hand people must buy a lot of food or stuffs for the snowstorm. In my opinion people should make a shopping list and eliminate useless item rationally and buy those things as soon as possible. No matter what the snowstorm will be staying warm and preparing enough food are the most two crucial decisions to keep safe and I hope everyone can be safe after the snowstorm.
