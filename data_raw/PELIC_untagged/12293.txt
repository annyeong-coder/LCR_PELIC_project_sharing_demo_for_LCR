In spring break I went to Florida with my husband and friend. We went for one week. We went by air plane we took two hours to arrive in the air port. We rented a car with GPS we went to saw a monument in Miami and walked in the beach. I bought some perfume sun creme and deodorant for my friend after the shopping we went to the buffet to have a lunch. I ate three apples a piece of pizza and a bowl of rice. We had a good time and I hope to go more in the future because Florida was a good city to have fan.
