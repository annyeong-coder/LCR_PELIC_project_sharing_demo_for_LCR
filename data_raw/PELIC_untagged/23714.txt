1. Friendship is a plant which we must often water. I think this means that like plant need water between friends we need keep in touch. Because we have friends whose personality different form us Like me and my best friend Emma who grow up with me. But there is a time that I was kind of estranging her like the whole semester because we were in different class in elementary. I think it is ok but Emma think it is not and one day I go to her home she said she doesn't want to play with me anymore and broke the toy car which I give heron her birthday. After while I try to explain and keep in touch with he rwhere ever am I!!!we are the best friend now and ever
