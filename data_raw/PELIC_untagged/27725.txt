When I got my first SIM card I had many strange phone calls. They had been calling back dozen times a day when I gave up and picked up the phone. He was a weird man and I didn't figure out what he was saying he kept going on and he end up by talking me into signing up then I told him to hold on. Finally it turned out to be a telemarketing call so I told him not to call again and I hang up the phone.
