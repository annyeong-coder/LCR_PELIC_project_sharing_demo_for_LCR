The best mirror is an old friend. . . . . Your old friend is who made you think about you past and your future. He or she talk you the thing that you wanted to hear and when hear it you can think if now you think the same way. Your old friend made you remember where you are in your life whose can be a nice feeling or bad feeling too.
