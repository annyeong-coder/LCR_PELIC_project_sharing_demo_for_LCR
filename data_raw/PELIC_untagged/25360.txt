Heir hair. They also sacrifice a sheep cow or a camel and they cook it with rice for lunch. Plants before this celebration. When Eid starts all the children take their plants to the sea. They sing a special song and they put their plants in the sea. They believe that the plants will reach their loved ones in Makkah and bring them back to their countries safely. The plants are called dokalah and that's why they call this tradition dokalah. There are many other traditions for children but they differ from one country to another. Children have a lot of fun on Eid Al Adha. Celebration. For me Eid Al Adha is the most wonderful celebration that I have ever had.
