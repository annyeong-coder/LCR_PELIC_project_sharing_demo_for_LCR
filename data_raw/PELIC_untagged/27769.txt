My first phone call in the US came from my bank PNC. When my phone rang I was so anxious and nervous that I couldn't pick up the phone! So I let the person hang up and I turned my phone off. The same evening when my boyfriend came back I was determined to straighten this problem out. Therefore I called back the PNC bank and turned the volume of my cell phone up in order for my boyfriend to help me. Furthermore I had thought about the questions which PNC wanted to ask me and I had prepared a list of vocabularies. A man picked up the phone. We talked about my profile my services and also we went over my information address. I found out many advantages with PNC. Besides the man talked me into sign up to pay my bills online. I was really happy because the man was kind and spoke slowly. So I succeeded to figure out the whole conversation. The most difficult was to answer but fortunately my boyfriend helped me. Therefore I kept on speaking with the man for 15 minutes. When we ended up the conversation I thanked the man and he congratulated me. It was a good exercise. I will try out to have more phone conversation in the future.
