Many of you are doubting what I will be doing if become president of the ELI. T o make you sure I would like to promise three things. First of all if I succeed in becoming president I will make all teachers available for your service. Second you'll eat your lunch for free if I get the place that I want. Finally you all know that tuition of ELI is expensive so if I am elected I'll decrease the tuition for you. Unless you vote for me you will lose all of these chances as you know now the advantages that I would do for you when I become president so vote for me and get whatever you want.
