My philosophy about weekends is unique usually I spend the whole weekend relaxing ang getting enough sleep gettin rest is crucial to survive in this tough life. However Friday is quite different than sunday cause I spend half of it in the ELI I still try to enjoy the rest of it by going out with my husband and doughter either to watch movie or have a dinner together. Unlike Friday sleeping untill noon is an inherent part of Sunday I justify this habit by my theory about sleeping I used to say you have to sleep well to enhance the quality of your life. While the majority of the people here have only one day off which is Sunday I think they try full it with the activities they like but the different between Sunday and Friday is that you can not access many places and resturants in the city cause usually they are closed in Sunday. Despite the fact that half of friday is usually spent in working or studying I enjoy it more than Sunday cause I anticipate lovely Saturday which is not the case in Sunday. In Sunday I prepare for Monday busy schedual. In both Sunday and Friday I like to spend my time with my family my small family is the first priority in my life.
