I met my husband in 1994. Actually we worked together in a hospital but we didn't like each other. One busy day I asked him to do some work but he didn't do it. I was angry with him for his laziness. He was talking with a patient when I came there. I scolded him he scolded me too. The patient was also shocked. Then we didn't talk to each other since that time. After one week a patient suddenly complained about chest pain sweating and back pain I called the on duty doctor to help. Unfortunately the doctor didn't call me back. I saw the patient getting worse. I was getting anxious and afraid when my husband came. While the on duty doctor was coming to hospital my husband finished the work. The patient was getting better and better. I invited him to dinner and we had a nice time. We talked about our childhood and personal value. I found we had similar backgrounds and beliefs. We were married three years later.
