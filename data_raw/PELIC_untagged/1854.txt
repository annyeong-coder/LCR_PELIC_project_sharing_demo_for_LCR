I don't agree with Clouse. He said if I saw people as individuals they were all basically alike. But I think there are people who are originally bad. I think most people don't hate to give what they like or think is good to other people whom they like. But I know someone who extremely doesn't want other people to have something better than hers. Even if she was old enough she wanted to brag herself. Also I am a bad person too. When I was a student I used to take a bus to get to school. In the bus whenever I saw the old I got angry and annoyed for no reasons. I just hated to see the old in the bus. I think most people don't feel like that way.
