Are you a new student at the ELI Then I can give you some piece of advice because I'm a student at the ELI. First of all you should understand cultural differences. There are many international students from different countries in the ELI so there are some cultural differences between other students and you. If you understand their culture you can be a good friend with other international students. Second you'd better not miss homework if you want to get good grades in the ELI. The teachers in the ELI don't give good grades to students who often miss homework. Lastly you should make a native conversation partner so that you can practice your English while you are enjoying the conversation. Also the native speaker may be able to help you understand American culture or life.
