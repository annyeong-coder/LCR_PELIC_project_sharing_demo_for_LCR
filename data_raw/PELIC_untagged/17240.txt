I think my personality is a mix between The executive and The Nurturer . Nurturers are people who cares very much about other people feelings. The Nurturer's are usually people who have a clear idea how things should be or work. The Nurturer's are practical people which means they tend to learn things the best by seeing a practical application. I think this apply on as a Nurturer. But sometimes I think I'm a guy whose personality is The Executive . Executives who are very career focused tends to believe that existing systems are there because they work. They are also people who are successful in the business world because they are so driven to leadership. Reference ANON_URLSPAGE_I read about personalities in this site before. I read again tonight and tried my best to turn the sentences into clauses.
