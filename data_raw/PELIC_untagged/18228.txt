Sincere Mr. Brown. I'm Han and now I am attending in ELI of University of Pittsburgh. I would like to apply to your school and I am going to major in mechanical engineering because I have heard there are many able professors and excellent education system. Moreover your school has given many foreign students scholarship. In fact I need the scholarship during studying in the U. S. The price of the U. S. Is higher than my country Korea. I have afforded money for my tuition fee rent and etc. However now I need the money more than I have thought. I can't work in the U. S. And I don't want to work because I am here to study not work. Therefore I hope I receive the scholarship. I already finished my undergraduate in my country but I would like to study again for four years and then I am going to apply the graduate. But before I apply the graduate I have to stay in my country for a year in order to make money for my tuition fee. So I want to know if I can have a long gap between the undergraduate and the graduate. In addition I have allergy to several kinds of chemicals. Could I take this major If I have critical situation for this major I have to give up this major. Thank for your help. From Han.
