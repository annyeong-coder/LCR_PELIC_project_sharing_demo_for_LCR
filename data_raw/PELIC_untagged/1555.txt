I think that Philip Wiley believes men and women should live togather. According to what he said if men and women lived in different worlds the results would be catastrophic. Also he said men are too aggressive to survive on their own and women are too helpless. If women didn't control them men would start more wars. If men weren't there to pump gas and run the businesses women wouldn't be able to manage. Therfore I think he beleves that men and women shouldn't live in separate world. Actually I have an arguments with Philip Wiley. In my opinion men and women should live in separate world in some cases but in some cases they should live togather. Usually it depends on the case. For example if men and women were separated in relationships like marrige we would have a lot of homesexual. In other cases for example men and women have to be in separate sport team because the women physically are not close in performance to men. But if women had the same performance as men they would play in one team. Another example in the Mosque men and women have to be separated because if they weren't separated they wouldn't foous on praying to God.
