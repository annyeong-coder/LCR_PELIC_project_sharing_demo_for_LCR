As a student in the ELI Friday always is my favoitte day in a week It is exhusting at the last day of the work week but I feel release to done with my class that is actully what Thank Godness It's Friday. I can do anything that I want to do after Friday afternoon such as hang out with my friends relax at home or stay in the library to enhance my knowledge. There are some similarities and differences between Friday and Sunday I can do anything on Sunday if I anticipatory done with my homework before. However it is a crucial if I done with my homework earlier on Sunday because I usually leave my homework at the last. The differences are that I can sleep till the time whenever I like on Sunday and I have more time can spand on Sunday. The only thing that I feel disapointed is the next day is Monday so I have to wake up early again.
