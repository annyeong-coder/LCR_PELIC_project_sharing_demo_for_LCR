Yes I think that a sand castle is a work of art because it is not easy to build the sand castle piece like Effel Tower. In other words making the sand castle requires a high concentration and patience as well the sense of art. Also we need some tools such as pail shovel and gadget etc for the sand castle. Moreover it needs a lot of failure effort and time to make a good piece of work. That's why I think that it is a work of art.
