I'm going to describe the picture that I'm seeing now. In the picture I can see two pieces of cheese. Also beside these pieces of cheese there is a knife. Also I can see one slice of watermelon. In this picture I can see some fruit I can say some cherries and some grapes. Also there is a basket of fruit. In the basket there is one apple. There is one cup of pink lemonade. Also there is a pitcher of water. In this picture I can see a chair. That is it.
