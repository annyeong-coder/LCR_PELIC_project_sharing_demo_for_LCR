At this time I want to write a personal statement to apply for graduated schools. I also want to study hard to pass the TOEFL test. I am planning to call Lamont Restaurant to make a reservation for tomorrow. I need to change some pieces in my car before traveling to Washington DC. I will go to Washington DC on Monday so I need to buy the equipment tomorrow. As a reward I will drink a cup of coffee after finishing this plenty of homework.
