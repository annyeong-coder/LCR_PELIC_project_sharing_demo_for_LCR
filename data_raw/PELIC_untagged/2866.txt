When I was child I lived in city. So I couldn't encounter experience my country's traditional culture. I've interested my country's traditional culture since I was junior school. Also I became to have interest in another country's culture. So I've tried learning another country's culture since I was junior. I've read a book about culture. I've been learning English since 2006 in Pittsburgh. I think language help to learn culture. So I've been planning learn another language for future since 2003.
