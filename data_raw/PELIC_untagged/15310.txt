My teacher asked us to choose one from two classmates to cooperate with him for all activities that we do in the class. It was after I compared and contrasted two students ANON_NAME_0 and ANON_NAME_1 that I finally decided to choose ANON_NAME_1 as a partner. At first ANON_NAME_0 and ANON_NAME_1 have a lot of things in common. Both ANON_NAME_0 and ANON_NAME_1 are cooperative students. They always help anyone in the class who needs help. Also ANON_NAME_0 as studious as ANON_NAME_1 ANON_NAME_0 always asks questions and he keep on doing his homework and ANON_NAME_1 is a good taker note and he always try to get full grad in his tests. Actually I knew these things about them because there is another thing in common between them that they have the same classes with me. Although they have many things in common there are several differences between them. In personality while ANON_NAME_1 is shy ANON_NAME_0 is social person. Also in nationality ANON_NAME_0 is from Libya but ANON_NAME_1 is from Korea. So ANON_NAME_0's native language is Arabic however ANON_NAME_1's native language is Korean. In conclusion after analyzed the similarities and differences between ANON_NAME_0 and ANON_NAME_1 I think I chose the right person. Working with partner has different country different culture and different language has many advantage such as exchange the information about the culture and the most important thing of work with partner has these characters is we have to use the English language to understand each other all of these things I found them in ANON_NAME_1 because ANON_NAME_0 and I are from the same country so I chose ANON_NAME_1 as a partner.
