Do friends have to like each other in the first meeting I do not think so. My friend Zyad and I are best friends who were foes in the elementary school which located between our two villages. He was very quite child who stay alone most of time but I was naughty child that loved fightings a lot. We were fighting every day after classes which finish at noon. After we graudated from the elementary school we moved to another school in a city that have intermediate school and we were go together. Then we became best friends.
