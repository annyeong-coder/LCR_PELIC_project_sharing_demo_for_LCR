Before I began studying English in Pittsburgh I had lived in Seoul for 24 years. Also I had been swimming for 16 years. I had been studying about physical education for 3 years. Before I came to the US I had never been to the US so I was so excited. By 2006 I had finished my military service in Korea but I hadn't graduated my university yet. By I became 18 I hadn't drunk alcohol. By 1996 I had never won a swimming competition. However I had won many swimming competitions by I was retired as a swimmer in 2005.
