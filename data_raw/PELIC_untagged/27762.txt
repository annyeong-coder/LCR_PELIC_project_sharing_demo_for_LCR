In this day and age alcohol has been common in people's daily life. More and more persons make alcohol as their part of life. At the same time the age of the people who like drinking alcohol is lower than many years before. Under such a background some people feel that the drinking age should be lowered from the current age of 21 to 18 despite many others do not agree with this overture. As far as I am concerned I believe that the age should stay in 21 because 18 is really too young to a people to control himself for drinking alcohol.
