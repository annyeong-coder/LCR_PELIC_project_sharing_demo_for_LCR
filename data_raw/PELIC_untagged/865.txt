10 17 2006 Dear Ruba I received your last letter and I'm very happy that you are all fine. Speaking of family matter I recently decided to change my oven. However I'd like to have some advice from you. You know I have had a gas oven for 10 years ago. It is old now. I thought if I want to reaper it it will cost a lot of money. Therefore I would be willing to pay a new one. I feel that is difficult to take one choice from many available options of the two main kinds of ovens a gas oven and the electric oven. They are different in two main reasons. At the time the gas oven is healthier for a cook you will find the electric oven is safer than a gas oven. I'm having a trouble with a gas oven when I change the gas cylinder. Also there are more diverse offers of the electric ovens than gas ovens. For example there is a digital electric's oven the self clean electric's oven and the electric oven with a flat surface on the top. I liked the last one. It was awesome but it was more expensive than others ovens. Any way when I have the new oven you will be the first person I invite her to share us the cheese cake. I know you adore a cheese cake so I'll make the special one for you. Love
