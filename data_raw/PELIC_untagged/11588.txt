When I was an elementary school student I read a book which is the Little Prince . The book which is related to our relationship taught me the meaning of tamed and taming. Also this book reminded to me the meaning of love which I had forgotten and made me think about my friends. I was able to get previous friends who always encourage and help me because of the book. I have two friends with whom I have hung out since my childhood among my friends. One friend's name is Won Sang and the other's name is ANON_NAME_0 Heum. First Won Sang has a chubby face which is like a baby's. He wears glasses which are frameless. He has a younger brother and his brother whose major is architecture is studying at Harvard now. Another friend is ANON_NAME_0 heum who has a younger brother. ANON_NAME_0 heum whose major is computer science is studying in the United Kingdom. He is a doctoral student now and he always says to me that I should go to Britain. Also he tells me British English is cooler than American English. However I answer to him I prefer American to British. I think that they haven't changed at all. When we were younger than now we used to fight each other. However we had been in company for teenage years. We had gone same schools until we entered university. Now even though we are far away we believe that our friendship will be not unchangeable.
