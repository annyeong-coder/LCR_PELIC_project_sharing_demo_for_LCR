I would like to talk about my room. My room is too big I have many stuff on the room. On my bedroom I have a queen bed and study table with study chair. Every day I have to wake up early for school. After that I check out the books and I go over to my homework. At night when I enter to my room I turn the light on take off my cloths and hang them away. I like to sit on the sofa. Because my chair is uncomfortable I will look up on Internet to find any comfort chair. I throw my cell phone away when I enter to my house because the network signal for T Mobile is bad. I talk over with T Mobile about the network signal and they figure out what the problem.
