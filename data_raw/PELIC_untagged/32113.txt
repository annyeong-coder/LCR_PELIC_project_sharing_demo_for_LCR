The effect of electron Human have discovered several things for couple of century. The most beneficial discovery would be electron. Since human used electron civilizations have been developed so fast. And there are not current high technic without invention of electron. The effects of discovery of electron are obvious using computers using network understanding nature. Due to discovery of electron people invented computers. Computers couldn't work without electron. Since computers were invented computers have been essential to human being. With computer people accelerated to develop their civilizations. The computer is the most beneficial invention. Therefore the most beneficial effect of electron is using computer. Now people can use computer with electron. And then people made the network. The network works in digital system. The digital system uses electronic signal. People can send information to other area very fast due to network. Wherever you go there are not places without network. I can hardly believe that people can live without network. Therefore using network is one of the greatest effects of electron. As people can use electron people can understand a lot of phenomenon of nature. For example human and animals even plants have electronic signal in their body. It implies human can't discover anything about them without understanding electron. Another example is weather. The thunder isn't understood without understanding electron. The power of nature is too strong so people should sometimes escape from disaster like thunder. It is obvious that electron is the most beneficial discovery. Electron can make us comfortable and develop anything. However people should be careful to use electron because wrong method of using electron can be cause disaster such as fire.
