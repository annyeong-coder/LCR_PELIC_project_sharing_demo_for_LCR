A guide of international student's school. Thing that studying in a strange town or city is very difficult let alone other country. Essential language in the world or necessary language to business or scholar is English. So many people of many countries want to learn English in the English speaking world. In result they who want to learn English could make new school that just study English such as ELI English Language Institute and ELS English Language schools . Students who are in school can be divided into three types students who want to enter a university students who want to get a good job and students who want to live in USA. First of all students who want to enter a university in USA are usually younger than other students. They just graduated high school. Their purpose is that entering the university and graduates the university so they will probably stay in USA approximately 4years. Therefore they don't care time that is they think they have a enough time to learn English so they are more relax than other students. Next students who want to get the good job are almost an undergraduate. They took time off school during 1 year. So they'd like to learn English as soon as possible while they stay in here. Their purpose are kind of a certificate of qualification such as TOEFL or TOEIC. Therefore they didn't seem calming down. Finally students who want to live in USA are almost very young or middle age. Their purpose are listening and speaking to live in here. They don't care about test by other organization. Most students in the English school want to speak English very well. They organize the school and they study with international students. Although their purpose is a little different they make friends in the school and they establish friendly feeling. I think that this process is kind of good chance to make friends and learn English.
