Dangerous if they escape the prison getting down the value for my neiborhood childern education needs building about education Have you ever imagined a new prison is in your neighborhood It is going to be very unhappy to you especially if you are a person who is really eager to make your neighborhood happy city to live. I do not agree with building the new prison in my neighborbood becaue of several disadventages for the people who are living there. First it is very dangerous to build the new prison in my town because it cannot avoid thinking about the possibilities of escaping. People in the town are scared of that and even cannot hang around freely at night . Even though how they have been living happy it makes people feel unhappy. In reality after building the prison more and more people leaving the town due to the danger. I think people always think about the value of their town. However it is obvious that the prison is not helpful for the value. Honestly nobody likes building harmful features like prison incinerating facility and even facilities for the old or disabled because people already know when the building is built the value is getting down. While some people claim the prison can be a good for the children's education. The children can learn what is wrong action and happens if they do thoes behaviors from the prisoners. I understand their opinion but in the other way they can learn the crime that they do not need to know Because the children are very young to distinguish.
