Becoming an adult means that is able to do everything what they want such as drinking smoking or gambling. But freedom which is from becoming an adult carries responsibility with it. Because drinking smoking or gambling cause a portion of social problem. For this reason many countries have a limit of age for drinking smoking or gambling. Most of countries have a limit of age under 18 that can't allow for drinking smoking or gambling legitimately. Whereas it is illegal that someone who is under 21 drinks alcohol in the only US. Although drinking alcohol requires responsibility and is possible to cause a social problem that under 21 can't drink alcohol is not reasonable. Because over 16 can have a qualification of getting driver license and most of over 18 can get in the university. For this situation how can under 21 keep the rule of drinking alcohol There are three reasons that drinking age should be lowed from the current age of 21 to 18.
