In order to improve my English I decided to study English at Pitt. I have studied English for one and half years. I really want to improve my speaking and reading comprehension before starting graduate school. I have thought about reading a novel for two weeks since I came to ELI. Today is a month later but I have not finished any book. Actually I cannot afford to read a book regularly so that this is very tough for me to accomplish. Even though I have not made a new hobby of reading I have been watching the drama Friends instead. I am still watching it because there are so many episodes in the whole series. Moreover I have thought about speaking English at least 12 hours a day. Because my sister lives with me I cannot speak English with her. I do not have a solution to solve this problem yet but I have been looking for one.
