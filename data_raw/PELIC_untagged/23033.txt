My apartment is small but comfortable. I lighted it up with a lot of lamps and also I hung up some mirrors. I chose up some furniture and I gave it out in the living room. I took down the awful pictures that I had as a result I could touch walls up. I covered the floor with a gorgeous carpet and I took off the older one. My husband turned the bed around and my daughter straightened her bedroom up. I plan to take the kitchen down and put another one newer.
