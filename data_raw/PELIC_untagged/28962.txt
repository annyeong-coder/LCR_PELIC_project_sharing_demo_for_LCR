Jobs I would be good at I would be good at a job working with people with details and with numbers. These processes improve my skills. While I did a different work I did well my role. I challenged problems and I was capable of doing more things. First I was working with people. I like to contact with people. For example I was a restaurant waiteress. My works are table service and dished the food. I contacted with people each day. While the customers complain the dishes or the service I tried to pacify the customers. I gave a good service to the customers. Such I was a secretary in the internet company. I worked with my boss all day. The emphasis is on take care of the boss. I have to control my emotions. I did not want to influence my boss. For instance when I was an accountant I have to contact with customers and government organizations. Second I was working with details. For example while I was a waiteress I had good memories. I remembered the price and what consist of the dish and how many dishes they ordered. For instance I usually detail to my boss when I was a secretary. I gave my boss available information and assisted him to contact with customers. While I worked in accounting firm I analyzed the best way to save tax to the customers. I reported the income statement to customers. Third I was working with numbers. For example I should account for the customers before they left the restaurant. For instance I was accounting income tax to government for the customers. Accounting tax should be carefully because the tax is for government and it is important. Whether I do any works I have to do my best and pay patience for work. Let the boss knows that I am of great worth.
