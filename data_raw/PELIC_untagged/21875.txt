My father was born in 1955. In last year my father was 55 years old. We are having a birthday party for my father. In the morning my mother was prepared decorate our house. First she cleaned up our apartment and washed the kitchen. Second she bought a lot of foods that including fish fruit chicken beef and so on in the supermarket. She wanted to give a surprise to father so she bought a bake that father always likes one. Next she invited many father's friends to come to our party. In the evening they arrived our home. We ate great dinner. Then we are talking about my father's life. At some time my brother took a bake to my father. He was very surprised and happy. Finally we sang a song to my father. It is having a good night.
