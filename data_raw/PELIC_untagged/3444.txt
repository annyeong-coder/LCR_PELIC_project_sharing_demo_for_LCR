When I was child I remember my granmother's kitchen which was small. In the right side was the table which we will eat are all meals. At front of the door was the sink on the top of the sink was a big window that has the view to her garden which she will spend a few hours every morning. In the kitchen beside the table was the refrigeridor which was brown. The stove was beside the sink which was also brown. On the table she always had a pice of chees that I will eating with a pice of membriyo. In the gabinet which were on front of the sink she had all the food cookies and bread. Granmom and I used to spend a good times in the kitchen. I remember that I was too short to wash the dishes in the sink so I will put a chair on front of it to stand on which let my granmom nerveous about it.
