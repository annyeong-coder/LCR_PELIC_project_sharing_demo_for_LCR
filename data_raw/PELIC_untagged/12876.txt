Dear the President of the United State My name is Minsuk Last Name from Korea First of all I'm pleasure in sending my first letter to you. Because of the source of trouble recently I made a decision to send a letter. I discussed an issue for smoking adolescents during a reading class. It seems to be a big serious problem in the whole world. Even though smoking is one of individual favorites troubling is the rise in youth smoking. Especially almost all cigarette companies are advertising for their tobacco around the world and it causes trouble that is increasing rate of smoking children. What is more important they don't become aware that commercials from cigarette companies are getting more insidious. In addition government in the U. S helps them with diplomatic pressures. Of course I figure out your economic aspect. However your government seems to miss the true nature of the moral problem. Protecting teenagers from smoking are our task for the future. It is including with not only American young people but also adolescents all throughout the world. Consequently I strongly ask you to improve a line of policy for the industry sell tobacco overseas. Teenagers in the world are significant for the future. I believe that you love all young people. Sincerely Minsuk Last Name .
