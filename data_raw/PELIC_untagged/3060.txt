A best friend has to have many good features. First he she is the person who always helps you when you need help. For example if you have financial problem he doesn't hesitate to help you. Second your best friend is also who worries about you. Third he she is the person who rejoices when you're happy and glooms when you're gloomy. Finally it is hard to find your best friend easily. My advice to you is don't leave the person who seems your best friend . Don't be upset when you shock in your friend because you chose the wrong person. It is very important to have a friend who has all of the characteristics above.
