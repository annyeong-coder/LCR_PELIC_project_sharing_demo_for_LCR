I have a good friend who lives in Madrid and she is my second best friend. She has a cousin who is my first best friend. Both My friend and I share the same birthday which is in February seven. Mary is one of that people that says friendship is for whole life and I really like when she said that because I think the same. We have lot of similarities which keep us together for a long time. Mary whose hobbies are the same of mine says that maybe in another life we were sister or twins. Despite the fact that Mary is my second best friend she has a dog who bothers me because it is barking me all the time. Mary built a dog's house that is wild and I think that dog does not deserve that house. However I love my friend and I miss her.
