Now the Beijing Olympic Park is an accessible place. It is free for every visitor. However during the Beijing Olympic Game you had to get the ticket to visit this park. In order to get in it you need go through a security check place. One of my friends told me that he was waiting there for 2 hours to get in the park. I did not have the ticket for watching the Beijing Olympic Game but the Paralympic Game. I remembered that I was waiting in anticipation to get in the Olympic nest building. It is a tremendous building I have ever seen. At night the decoration lights enhanced the image of the bird's nest. In the other side of the park there is another famous building the Water Cube. I walked besides the building and revealed that this building was covered by hundreds of Plastic air bubbles . Under the sunshine the Water Cube likes real bubbles. I spent a whole day to visit the Beijing Olympic Park and took a lot of photos. I think the Chinese peaceful corporation policies underlie the success of the Chinese stable developing.
