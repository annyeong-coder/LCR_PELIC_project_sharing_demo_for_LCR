I think the sand castle is a work of art because of many reasons which are the person who made it has a vision and far imagination thoughts starting from choosing the type of sands place and the equipment that he going to use. I never heard about it as a major of study but it is one of the skills that it comes with long time of experience hand skills and imagination. When the sand castle have been built you can see the difficulty of doing one like it. From my prospective I think the person who did a sand castle is an artist because it's require a lot of work to do to make it in a good shape and satisfying the people.
