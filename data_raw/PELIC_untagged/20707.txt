The story that turned out as my mother hopes and expected happened after I graduated from a university in 2006. At first I had a plan to study master degree in major hospitality in Switzerland. However my mother did not agree with my opinion because she would like me to have a work experience first. She mentioned that if I have chance to work I will know what kind of work suit me so I decided to apply for a job at the hotel which I used to be a trainee during my internship period. Fortunately I got accepted from the hotel and I worked for the company as a sales representative for a couple years. This situation caused a tremendous change in my life because it was my first job. Moreover it was a very tough duty. I had to deal with many people who had different characters. Besides I had to tackle with many problems that happened. As a result I had changed my mind not to study hospitality because I knew that I did not like a service job. I did not know that what would happen to my life if I would not listen to my mother at that time.
