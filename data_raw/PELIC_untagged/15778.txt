Five months ago I fill out an application when I rented my apartment but before I signed up I looked over the application I found some mistakes. I talked over with land lover and we corrected that mistakes. Now I am feel vary comfortable in this apartment because this apartment like my old apartment in my country where I grown up. Also there are many things cheer me up in these apartment such as its location it located in quiet and safe aria. My advice for any new student wants to rent an apartment thinking over and pick out the apartment in a good aria.
