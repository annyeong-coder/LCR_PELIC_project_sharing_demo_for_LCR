Locked in a closet on Venus Margot risks to miss the sun which is visible only a few hours every seven years. Just like a flower waits the spring to bloom Margot who is born on the blue planet has been ardently waiting for this celestial revival. Unfortunately if she doesn't find a way to go out of this closet Margot would wither and fall into a deep depression. Meanwhile William and the other students are waiting for finally having the occasion to play outside in the warming and comforting heat of the yellow giant. Suddenly Margot notices a small hole in the side of the closet. Through this little hope Margot is able to get her small fingers across and open the closet. Released from its prison of shade the fragile earthwoman runs towards the door where her schoolfriends are still waiting for a light that they do not really know. When she arrives at the door all of them look lost and desperate. The sun will not come not today not even tomorrow. The scientists just announced it says William. Unable to bear it Margot pass out and falls in the ground. At that moment the flood of tears stops falling from the sky and a huge golden smile shows his face. William lied the sun is coming. Instantly all children run outside to enjoy this redemption. Margot still unconscious lies on the cold ground of the classroom. And when she comes to her senses again William and the others are back in the classroom. Outside the long cold and sad winter sets in for seven more years
