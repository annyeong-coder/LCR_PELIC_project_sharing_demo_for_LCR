This morning I woke up when the phone started to ring. I picked it up like a instinct and I that wasn't for me the call nobody calls me here! The worst thing is that was a record so I'd to listening everything 'cause could be something important. But it wasn't. Just one more telemarketer to talk me into sign up a gossip magazine. I tried two times to explain that I'm not the owner of the house or their son just a exchange student. So I give up and said to him to call back at afternoon to talk with Pam and maybe go on this. After I hang up the phone I got a shower fast 'cause I was late!
