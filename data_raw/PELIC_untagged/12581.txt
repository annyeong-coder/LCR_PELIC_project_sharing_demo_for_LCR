When I was little the town where I lived Seoul was always full of cars and people. I had three best friends who always rode bikes with me at our school's sports field. I can remember that more than half of the homes where people lived in my hometown were apartments. Many Korean people liked apartments but to this day I don't know why they do. Also there were many big and small parks in my hometown where my friends and I often played and rode our bikes after class. At that park my friend who is named June fell and broke his arm. I'll never forget that day. The reason I'll never forget that day is because we had no phone. Therefore it was my friends and I who had to take him to the hospital on our bikes. In the neighborhood where I lived there were also some big churches. Every week I would go to those churches to listen and pray. I liked going there because it was a place where many good teachers and pastors went. Also when I was little there was a lot of construction on Seoul's subway so I remember all of the loud noises. When they used dynamite sometimes I even got so surprised from the noise that I fell over. But nevertheless I liked my hometown. It was the place where my good friends and parents lived. Though I'm studying English in Pittsburgh now sometimes I miss the place where I grew up.
