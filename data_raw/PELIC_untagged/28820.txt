Since I was young I have had inherently a lot of curiosity toward the world. I observed all subjects around me and asked myself continuously for the world. I really liked to create and imagined the new ones which did not exist or were not invented in this world. I tried to make cartoons in a little my notes and write a number of stories and scripts. After being an adult I have started to dream about more specific world beyond my abstract childhood when I used to imagine what I hope. I wanted to find and make my philosophy considering my academic background. At that time I was wondering about human being because human being was the only existence who was able to create and invent something in the universe. Thus I really wanted to know and read one's behavior and mind. I thought there would be something special that can control and stimulate human mind. By finding this I believed that I was able to make better world. Human being is the most complex one in the world. Understanding and learning about human I would be able to create more convenient and sustainable society. My major Human Computer Interaction would attribute to make innovation of society playing a crucial role in being a bridge between human and computer. Studying both human and computer people can generate a method which people have never imagined in order to change the world. Therefore I desire to study further and I believe that I can make better place for the entire human race through my study.
