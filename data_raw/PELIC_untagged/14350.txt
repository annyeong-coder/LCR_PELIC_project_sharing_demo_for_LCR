Today is on Sunday. ' When I woke up I suddenly wanted to listen to my best friend ANON_NAME_0 seon's voice. So I looked up her number and then picked up the phone. As pleased she said to me she still is going on studying to be a government officer and she'll never give up. Also she told me that she is thinking over breaking up with her boyfriend in next week. I didn't want her to be depressed. So I said he is really kind and I talked her into keeping on getting along well with him . First she turned down my advice but she seemed to think about him again. I was glad that she seemed to figure out they would be happy. We had a good time for a long time. After approximately half hour I said Take care and I'll call you back soon. I wanted to talk to her more minutes but I hung up the phone.
