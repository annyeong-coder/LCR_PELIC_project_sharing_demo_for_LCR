Before making a decision about what I will study I thought it was very difficult decision and not easy because I didn't have any trend or philosophy about any things. In the same time Having depended on it and my dream will be truth it is very a crucial decision. I wanted to ask my parents about it what they wanted me to become. They told me that think about your ability and about your future and try to generate something will help people in all life. I started thinking about something is will help humanity in different aspects. I decided to ask some friends who are closed from me. Some of them gave me ambiguous opinion that is difficult to understand other told me that I should study in medical field. When I was in high school some teachers told me that I ought to study in medical field that will help people to recovery from diseases. They attributed me by bringing some materials that will help me to get acceptance in university. I decided to apply in university having called King Abdul Aziz University. I applied in medical school having had more than three exams that made my chance for acceptance very low. I passed two exams that are very easy. The third one is very difficult and I cannot pass. I choose other university that it accepted me after I took two exams. Now I'll continue in medical fields that will be helpful for my future.
