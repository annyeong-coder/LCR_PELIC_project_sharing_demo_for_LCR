He might have fought with someone because he refused to speak to anyone or he might have had an accident. Whatever he must have visited a hospital because of broken arm. Last week he must have felt bad because he missed 3 days of class. And he must have been sick. Now he must feel embarrassed because everybody want to know about the reason why his arm was broken. Also he might not be sick than before. He should not fight with friend or he should watch out for danger.
