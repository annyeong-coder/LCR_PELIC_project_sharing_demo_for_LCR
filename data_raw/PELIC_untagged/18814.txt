This semester I learned a lot of things one of them was learned English but the most important and exciting was met many people of all around the world. It is not a usual thing that I can do every days or in every places. I could understand many different customs. In addition I could improve my English speaking to them about differences topics such as their languages their economical country systems and their cultures. After three month in ELI I think that my English has improved but isn't enough yet. I have improved so much my speaking skills and my listening skills and I have understood that the process is slow and difficult and require so much patience to be happy and relaxing with my second language. Finally I'll try to continue improve my English skills by myself because I'm going back to Chile in two week.
