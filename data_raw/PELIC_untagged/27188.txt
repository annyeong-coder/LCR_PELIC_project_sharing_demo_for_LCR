Food and water are the most important. First I think we should take many pails of fresh water and a lot of beans. We might not find enough water and any food on the island. For the other devices I think We could take one fishing equipment and a telescope and some of fireworks. For fishing equipment because food will be run out. We can use the fishing equipment to fish for eating. A telescope may help us to find new food or a waterfall even other boats. Finally we can light the fireworks to let other ships save us.
