A friend is the person who I hang out with all the time and the acquaintance is the person who I say hello to sometimes but I don't go out with. A friend is the person who I share my secret's which nobody knows about them except my friends to and tell him a story that I like to share with friends. But the acquittance is not the person who I like to share with him everything. Actually im not sure if I really want to open a subject with him.
