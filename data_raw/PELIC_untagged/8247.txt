It is not easy to make a decision when you are a leader. When I was an associate chief I could not make a wonderful plan. I needed to survey the opinion form all members to organize my activity before I done the plan. Some of members would give me a few of suggestions while we are promoting the plan but it was not really useful for me while the personal suggestion did not benefit for everyone. Maybe I could accept it that is suitable in making another plan. After that I lost the member when the decision was not good for him. This is the reason that I will receive different opinion form the protest. I can't please the person in that most members are not really wanted that.
