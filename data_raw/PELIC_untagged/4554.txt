I think that I have been most influenced by my mother. Everytime I had some problems I was helped by her to figure out how to solve the problem. When I chose something wrong I was persuaded by her to change my mind. After marriage I am surprised at how I am acting. Her influence can be seen in my behavior to my husband and my son and I am still inspired by her especially by way she teaches me how to make happy family. I always thank her.
