American and Saudi cultures Every nation has its own culture. There are many different between the cultures in several aspects social economy education religion food etc. I think it's very interesting to know about different cultures and discover what are the difference and the similarities. As example there are many different and similar between American culture and Saudi culture in several aspects we can mention social economy and religion. First there is some similarity between the tow cultures in the social life. Families meet on weekend and like to have picnics together. In the both culture people Help others visit the patients and respect old people. Some of difference between the tow cultures that Saudis Live in a large houses and the family has a big numbers of members. Saudis often keep the relationship with the tripe. Also Women have a special situation is Saudi Arabia She covers her self so nobody can know her and She's usually separated with men. Second in Economy the tow country are Capitalism and they depend on oil. In addition there are an Economic connection between Dollar and Riyal. But Generally USA is more expansive than Saudi Arabia and there is no tax in Saudi Arabia. The resource of the economy in Saudi Arabia mainly is the oil. USA has many resources in additional of oil like industry and military. Finally USA and Saudi Arabia are religion countries and they respect the other religions. On the other hand the religion in Saudi Arabia is only Islam. The religion in USA is variety but the majority of Americans are Christians. The place of pray in Saudi Arabia call mosque and Muslims pray five times daily. Christians pray mainly on Sundays in the churches. Saudi Arabia known as the leader of Muslims and Christians obey Vatican but this isn't accurate at all. Its not important to be the same but what ever we are different we can live in peace and understand each other. In fact Americans and Saudis are connected by very strong friendship.
