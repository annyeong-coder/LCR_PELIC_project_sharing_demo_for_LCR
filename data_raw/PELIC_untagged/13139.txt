There was a man his name is Aron Ralston. He likes to climb the rocks by his bike. In April 36 2003 Aron went out of the city to hike in southeastern Utah. He got an accident and his hand stuck under the rock for fife days he tried many times to help himself but he couldn't. He found only one way to survive which is to cut his hand and leave to any place to help him. He did that and the family found him and called for help after that he survived.
