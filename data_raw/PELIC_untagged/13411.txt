When I was childhool I used to play barbies. I carried it my hand all the time. I used to have a perm hair. I liked it. I used to live house with my family and I used to walk anywhere. Today I am living apartment with my cousins. I don't like to walk. So I always take a bus. I have straight long hair. I don't play barbies. Because I'm 20 years old.
