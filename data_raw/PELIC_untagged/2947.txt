Being a Successful ELI Student It's not easy to be learn another langage not owns. Still more we have young kids. Ther are children who we must take care of in home. Husbands wait that we prepare the dinner. Babies want us to play with themselves. We have no time t study in home. How can we a successful ELI student By not skipping the class going over it before and after the class and doing apply environments around your self. An important first thing is not to skip the class as possible as you can. If you often skip your class you might have more trouble to follow the course. Of course your children can be sick. The children's school might be able to closed by heavy snow. So sometimes it seems to be unavoidable to skip the class in the emergency case. Even though make effort not to skip the class. Consider a counterplan when kid's school would be closed. To give an example you can find neighbor to look them after. Another strategy is to go over it before and after your class. It's very useful to review the contents that would be learned that day in advance. If you went over it you can understand what teachers say more easily. To go over it you need to schedule the life time of family in home. Even if small time every day do review what you leaned after school. In addition to it doing apply environments around you is help you to improve English. We can't join the group out of the class like the movie group the sports group something like that. But we can talk with children's teachers talk with moms of sons or daughters classmater about camp program healthy matters and education problems. We can read a lot of children's school letters and also read a lot of picture books to put them to sleep. Because we are not only a wife or husband but also parents who have to take care of children studing English is too difficult. When you do three things what I mention above you can feel more comfortable to be a good ELI student.
