I was listening to a small concert in a jazz club when I met her Jaekyung. Because I was stressed out from excessive writing at school I went there with my friends to refresh ourselves. We enjoyed several musical performances and then she appeared on the stage with her band. She was a vocalist. I was entranced with her sweet voice while she was singing. So I made a request to her to sing one of my favorite songs Misty and she accepted my request. After all the songs were over I got near her and talked with her about music for a long time. And before long we felt friendly toward each other. From that day she and I have been close friends and we have continued our friendship up to now.
