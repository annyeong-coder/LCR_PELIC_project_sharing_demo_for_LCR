Effects of Economy The world economy is in a serious recession. Inevitably it has affected a lot in my country. First of all some people in my country were laid off when the world economy was depressed. They had good jobs before the economy crisis. Then suddenly they were told to pack their stuff and do not have to go to work anymore. Although they could get some compensation called severance pay they were still anxious. What could they do All they could do is to find another job if they could and adapt the new one as soon as possible. Moreover the stock market crash made so many people lose their whole money in one night. Some banks just revealed this situation to their investors and said sorry. However they did not do anything to compensate their costumers. That made people angry. Therefore some people went to a demonstration to show their strong dissatisfaction. In conclusion the world economy depression triggered a serious of problems. The government should do something to reduce the bad effects. I wish it would not happen again in the future.
