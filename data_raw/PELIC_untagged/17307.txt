It has been three years since I came here in America. When I first time came here I had never expected myself to fail. But truthfully there were nothing close to my expectation which I had learnt from Hollywood movies. Of course as a new resident I was faced with every single difficulty such as language barrier and cultural differences. I even had trouble to find the right food which was the food I used to eat in my country. Everything seemed so hard to me and I always thought about going back to Mongolia. The first year was completely difficult but by the second year I started working as a Mongolian reporter in the States and even I had opportunity to make a report from the White House during the Mongolian President's official visit in America. By the beginning of 2008 I had found out that I was pregnant that was a reason why I stopped working as a reporter. As today I have been busy since my baby Simonne's birth. Also I have been trying to improve my English. Compared to my first year experience in America I have gotten more confident living here and now I am comfortable with my future.
