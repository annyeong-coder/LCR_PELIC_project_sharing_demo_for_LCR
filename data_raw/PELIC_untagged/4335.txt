My favorite restaurant in Taiwan is a noodle soup restaurant. That restaurant is very famous. Many people know this restaurant and the restaurant also could make many kind of noodle soups form different countries. Usually I will go to this restaurant eating my favorite one with my family and girlfriend. Maybe four times a week. Why did I very like this restaurant Because I am very like spicy soup. And the restaurant can made very spicy soup too.
