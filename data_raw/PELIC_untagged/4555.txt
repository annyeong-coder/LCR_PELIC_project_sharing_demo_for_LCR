If I could live in any time period I would choose to live in present. Because I like the way my life goes right now. First as I am only 18 right now I will get many opportunities such as continuing education getting jobs. Second I really like that I am studying US right now by living in present. It's such a great experience. I am having more advantages than others who are in my ages. In addition I like the place where I live right now. There are movie theater shopping mall and coffee shop around where I live. I love to enjoy all that advantages by being there. Finally I am having independent life by living in US. I can think of myself by being alone. I get to behave my self by my sense of responsiblity. Considering all that reason if I could live in any time period I would like to choose the present time.
