I have thought about taking a Yoga class because I have wanted to lose weight and to make shape of my body good. However I changed my mind recently because I heard bad things about Yoga. One of my friends said that the purpose of position of Yoga is calling a ghost inside people. So I was scared and did not want to take the class. Instead of that I am thinking about taking a Pilates class. I hope it doesn't have anything about ghost. Resubmit I have thought about taking a Yoga class because I have wanted to lose weight and to get my body in shape. However I've changed my mind recently because I've heard bad things about Yoga. One of my friends said that the purpose of Yoga positions is calling ghosts inside people. So I was scared and did not want to take the class. Instead of that I am going to take a Pilates class. I hope it doesn't have anything to do with ghosts. But today my grammar teacher said Yoga is not bad. So I've been thinking about taking both classes. For now I have not decided yet.
