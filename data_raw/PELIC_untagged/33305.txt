Last summer I was painted our house. The job took about tow weeks. First I washed the exterior using warm water and a mild detergent. Then with putty were sealed all the chinks and pores. After the putty had a chance to dry The exterior could be painted. A latex paint was used because it is easy to apply and cleans up with water. A whole week was needed to finish this part of the job. I was very careful to apply the paint evenly because I did not want to have to apply tow coats. A color was used that very close to the original color. Our house is a two story hous which mean that a tall ladder was needed to do the second story. The paint can had to be balanced on the top rung of the ladder while I worked. When the job was finished I felt a great deal of satisfaction. I had to pot myself on the back. Even my dad said that a good job was done.
