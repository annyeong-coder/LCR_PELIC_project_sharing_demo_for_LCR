When I looked back to myself I found that my personality would fit in extrovert and thinker. It is distinctly clear on my learning process which is taking place in ELI. I really feel learned more in classes than study by myself in Human library where I usually study in. Also I realized that I am a thinking person. Let's use knowing my grade as an example I think grading from teachers are fair enough in that they evaluate mine on my what I have done in classes and homework which are a part of studying materiel. There are my personality which I have found today.
