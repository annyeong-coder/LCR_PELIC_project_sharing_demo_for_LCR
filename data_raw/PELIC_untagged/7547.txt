When I have to write something I first of all think about a topic and than I write it. If the topic is good that is I already know about topic or I have a lot of feedback about topic I can write more easier. However If I don't have enough idea about the topic I can't write enough. Second I always try to write new grammar in the writing of course that is probably wrong but I try it. Thank you for teach me. See you later. .
