Parents are the first teachers that we ever meet. When I stepped into this world I was unfit to survive on my own. Therefore childhood years are the most suitable time to create the characteristics of a person. In addition this is a crucial time for parents to teach their children about good things and bad things. Children have the largest capacity to learn and always are ready to get knowledge. Indeed most children regard their parents as their role models so it is very important for parents to inherit good qualities. First of all I strongly believe that an ideal parent should be committed. For instance my mom whose name is Soon Rye devoted herself to her family. The number one priority in her life was her husband her daughter and me. I can learn from her love and I think that my mom is the most important person in my life. Second an understanding parent is one who is supportive and shows consideration towards their children's decisions and views. This is to prevent their children from feeling upset and making them feel happy. Finally parents must be caring and focus on their children. If parents don't focus on their children they will feel neglected and they would not receive enough love and attention from their parents. As a result they may indulge in crimes and other undesirable behaviors such as smoking drinking and premarital sex later in life. I swear that I will be a father who is like a friend to my children.
