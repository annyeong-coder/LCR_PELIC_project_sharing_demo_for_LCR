Thai and Chinese really have the same eating habit even though they are owned eating custom. Each country around the world has the diverse food and eating because they are separated by geography and culture. This was amazing things that I found the similar eating habits between Thai and Chinese. First of all both Thai food and Chinese food are cooked in the same way. Not only Chinese usually cook by boil stir fly or steam but Thai also for example Pad Tai is the popular Thai menu that is known around the world which cooked by stir fly meanwhile China has fired rice as the main dish on a table that cooked by stir fly as well. Second Thai always eat cooked food and do not eat raw food Chinese either. Chinese custom believe that what they eat should cooked in order to kill bacteria or virus Thailand as well. We do not eat raw fish like Japanese and fresh salad like American. Finally most Thai food is made of vegetable. Likewise Chinese food is almost made of vegetable. You would see at least one dish of each meal that was made of vegetable such as stir vegetable soup vegetable or steam vegetable. In Thailand has the unique dip or sauce which has to eat with steam vegetable. The similar eating habits between Thai and Chinese are the way to cook food always eat cooked food and the food almost made from vegetable.
