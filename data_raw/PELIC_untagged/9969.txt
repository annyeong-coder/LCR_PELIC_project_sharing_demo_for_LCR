I have good ideas How to learn English. First of all you should watching TV then you can listen a lot of conversations. When You watch tv show you should watch your favorite TV shows. It is very interesting for you. Second you should use environment of your school. If you use it it helps a lot of your studying. Third you should make friends of native English. Then you are learn how to learn speaking English. Next when you listen to the radio tv or tape you should note taking. Then you understand more than just listen. Finally you should study very hard when before you go to the school first you study review the textbook. Also after your classes you should study that day learn. Most important is just do it. If you do concern everyday you can't get anything. You should do it right now.
