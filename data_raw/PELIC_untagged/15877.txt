One of the many art styles I like is oil paintings of the outside view. For one thing View paintings are rich colorful and alive. For example the famous painters in the world Vincent Van Gogh drew thousands of images. His paintings are very colorful and alive. One example of an outside view from his paintings is Starry Night and Sunflowers . Also outside view paintings are relaxing and enjoyable to look at. I loved visiting the art galleries in Europe. I recommend visiting the Louvre Museum art in Paris Van Gogh Museum and many more famous museums. Finally looking at view paintings helps imagining places you would like to currently be at. It makes you drift away with your thoughts. There is something special and inspiring looking at view painting. I like view paintings and I wish I could have some original outside view paintings at my home.
