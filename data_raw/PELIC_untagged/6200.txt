When I moved in my room for the first time my room was very messy so I took away many stuff like desk chair table. My room is very hot. That is why last week I picked out the fan. I have a roommate who is from Taiwan. He cheers me up because he is very friendly and kind. When I realize that I have to wash the dishes and clean the room by myself those brings me down. I'd like to have lager desk. I will go back Korea this December so I'd like to get ahead for learning English in here during the remainder of period.
