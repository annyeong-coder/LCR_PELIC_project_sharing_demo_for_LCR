My best teacher is my father because he has taught me about life. When I was young he made me learn to be honest. When I was an elementary student he always helped me do my homework even though he was tired. He let me stay over at a friend's house. He always trusted me. Sometimes he got me to learn drinking manners which is important in my society. He didn't have me meet a girl when I was young. I really appreciated that he is my father.
