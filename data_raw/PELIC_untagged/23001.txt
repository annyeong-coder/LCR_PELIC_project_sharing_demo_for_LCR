Flow is that you do something you like to do or you enjoy that moment you want to continue it. During the flow you feel deeply relax. I like sitting in meditation. I am a Buddhist. In several years ago I went to a temple to take part in an activity. I couldn't speak with everyone and couldn't write anything. I just sit in meditation in seven days. First three days that was difficult to relax I felt tired and bored. However everything was changed in after several days. I felt clear and clean. It's not easy to describe the feeling. Now I try to sit in meditation every day. It only needs several minutes turn phone off close eyes and relax body muscle . I can do this anytime or anywhere but I will recommend a new learner to sit in a quite place that will be easy to feel deeply. Schools should give some right for teachers because they know students' reaction in the classes. Teachers can design the teaching processes to become flow.
