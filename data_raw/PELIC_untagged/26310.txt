Sadness Everyone around the world went throw sadness situation with out any known that will happen. I saw a picture there was a woman and her daughter the woman were crying and her daughter was trying to make her smile but that eas hard I think because the mom was very sad. The most three thing that cause someone cry is lost someone feeling lonly and losing a job. First most of people cry because they lost someone in thier life maybe the mom lost her son in accident. Also I cried when I lost my grand mother when I were kid because she was really nice with me she were always asking how am I doing in my life. Second maybe she is crying because remember her husband and how he was make her happy and treat her as a genteel man. About me since I have travled abroad from my country I feel lonely because when I were there I used to hang out every day with my best friends ever even thou I have my class mates but there is different between friend whome you sharied allt he happeniss and whome you jusr met in another country. Third now a day it is really difficult to live without a job because it is everything to survive in the life. She might lost her job and she is crying because she can not feed her children and afraid for them to become homeless and her daughter try to relief all the prusher from her mom. I knew someone who used to be in a great position on a company and he had a great salary and one day the company fired him because he had a illness so he can not work anymore so he cried for many days for that but thank god that he had sons that care about him because they have a jobs. In order to lost someone feeling lonely and losing a job that cause the sadness to everyone who had been in those situation and we should always support all the people whome have any of those problems so we make them happy not sad.
