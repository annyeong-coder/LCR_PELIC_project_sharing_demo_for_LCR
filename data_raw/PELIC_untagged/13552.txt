Most researches are conducted by investing money from governments organizations or individuals and sometimes some of them can produce disappointing or controversial results. Scientific researches or experiments have many factors that researchers can't control or predict when researchers do research. So we will change original plans to control or consider unknown factors for optimized results. If the result of researches is not good due to unknown factors we can learn from the result what researchers did how to do or not to do and why the results are not good. If the poor result of researches is due largely to mistake these researches and researchers become a serious problem. Despite the fact that a research results in not good we can learn from experience about what is done by the research how researcher did and how we will do next.
