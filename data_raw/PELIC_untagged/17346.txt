My apartment is very mess and it bring me down so I have to straighten it up. I have to put everything away before I clean my room. For example my books are putted in everywhere so I have to keep it before I vacuum my room. Moreover there is much dirty paper on the floor which I have to throw it away. In addition I should put some picture up on the wall in order to cheer me up when I feel sad.
