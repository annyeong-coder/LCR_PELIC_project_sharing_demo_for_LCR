Tripoli the city where I was born is located in north of Libya. I remember the school named Aljbal which I was studied on. My teacher ANON_NAME_0 who taught me in geography was good teacher . I do not forget the garden where I was played with my sister . This school which I still like is located near our house. This house where my parents live is very big. I like our house is garden which I was met with my friends . I played with my neighbor is son whose house close to the school. I love that days when we lived asjust little kids . .
