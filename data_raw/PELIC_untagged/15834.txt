My family is big and has many members. I have three aunts two uncles and three brothers. However the most interesting is my uncle Aziz. I love my uncle so much because he is very kind smart and he is a hard worker. Aziz is the oldest member of my family. Although he is an eldrly man now he is in good health condition. He has a short and white mustache and grey beard. Under his messy hair he has a wrinkled forehead and brown eyes. Aziz is short and skinny and he wears the traditional clothes. On his right forearm he has an old scar caused by a knife stab. Uncle Aziz has an amazing history. He had a hard time. He was born in a poor village in the desert. His father died when he was ten years old. He could not continue his education because he had to work and help his family. When he was eighteen he left home to work as a truck driver. He faced a lot of problems in his life but he overcame them. For example when he was in one of a terribl trip in winter his truck has been stolen and his documents lost. Further more he had to work 14 hours a day in order compensate these lost staff and look for a new documents. Finally he became a successful business man. I love spending time with my uncle Aziz because he is wise and has a wide experience in life. I like his advice because he teaches me how to be patient and work hard.
