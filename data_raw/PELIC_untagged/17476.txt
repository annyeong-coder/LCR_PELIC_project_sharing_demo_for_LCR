Learning and creativity seem different but I think they are connected. In my opinion we can develop our creativity though learning process. Creativity doesn't mean anything without its result. When someone is interested in somethingthat is specific field he she needs to study about something. As they learn their specific field their creativity can come out. However when they learn their field if someone who teaches them is so strict and tries to evaluate their students every time it kills the students' creativity. I think the best way to improve student's creativity is to encourage them to keep interested and give a positive direction. Also if it is possible to teach children who are interested in a particular field I think children can learn their interests without going to school in terms of creativity.
