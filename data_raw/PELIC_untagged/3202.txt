ShenYang where I was born and grew up is a big city on the northeast of my country. Shenyang where it recorded my childhood is also a place where my new life begins. I clearly remember that my home a small house was on a semicircular street in my hometown. The building is just one story and it did not have basement so my family's members were easily to come and go out. In the back was a mini park that was a funplace for our children. My friends and I always went to the park when school ended. In the spring we often played different balls such as basket ball. I really loved the winter because the park was changed to a skating rink when winter came so I went to learn and practice my skills of skating in the skating rink. My school was next to my house. I always invited my classmates to dinner with my parents who liked to cook delicious food for us.
