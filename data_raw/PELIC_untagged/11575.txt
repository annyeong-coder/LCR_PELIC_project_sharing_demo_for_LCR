I often went to my grandfather's house where my grandfater is still living now when I was a child. There was a big garden in front of the house and a field behind it. I liked to play in the garden with my little friends who lived in the neighborhood of my grandfather's house. They were all so kind so I always remembered the wonderful time that I spent with them. I also remembered a girl whose name is Xiaowe because we were in the same elementary school before I moved to another city. Last year I went back to visit my grandfather when I ate at some restaurant a woman whom I met just was her who was the owner of this restautant. I was wrought up for meeting unexpectedly.
