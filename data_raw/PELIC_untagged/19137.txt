I personally think that it would be a good thing if the tourism to my country were to double in the next 20 years. However this has to be control strictly by the tourism authority and other related industries. Travelling can help improve the country's economy. Also the tourism authority and other related industries can provide more job to the locals. A lot of tourists visiting the country also means that it is another way that they will help promoted my country to their friends and relatives. Nevertheless there are also many attractions that the government has to strictly control the population of the visitors to maintain the pristine condition such as the national parks. If not these places will be destroyed and there will be no natural resources and in the end there will be no visitors as well. The visitors also have to acknowleged the invaluable of the places that they visit. It is crucial that everyone has to help reserve the natural environment for our future generation.
