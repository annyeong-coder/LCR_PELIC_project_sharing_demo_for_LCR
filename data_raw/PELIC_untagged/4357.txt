Yesterday I should have taken an umbrella with me. It rains a lot so I had to wait until it stopped. In the morning I watched the sky and I felt that it might not rain again. However in case of rain I think I might bring it and leave it in my cabinet. Before going out it might be a good idea to check the forecast.
