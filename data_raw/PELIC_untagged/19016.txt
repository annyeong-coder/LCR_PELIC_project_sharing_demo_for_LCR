I think if let me choose where in the world you would go if money no object I will definately say to go back my home town China. Because home always let me feel so warm. First I don't have speaking problem after I stay us a couples of year when I have bilngual lanuages it make me strong I can work for different international companies but my main language is still Chinese. Second I can oftenly see my parents and family folk I don't have homesickness anymore. Weekday I work hard weekend I go back my parents house and enjoy mom home made foods. Also I can hange out my close friends to go different fun place. Such as famous Chinese dian shen place watching tipic traditional Beijing opera show. The last reason I often visit different famous Chinese resort by myself driving. After work hard whole week day week end I carry my ipod and cooler drive around different resort I only spend 2 hour to Hangzhou west lake drink longjin tea and sit with nice lots lake. All exhuasting is releasing. . Now I have the family in the US I come back hometown and live there always become my dream.
