Variety is the spice of life In daily life variety is usually the spice of our life. Some unusual happenings in my life often gave me or my family a lot of delight. When I continuously work hard for a long time and finished the work perfectly I should have a vacation together with my family or my good friends in beach. When I research a project and come up against a little trouble I should have a cup of coffee and enjoy wonderful music. I have a child I am his father. But I may be his brother and may be his friend too. In these occasions I and my child are extremely happy. I haven't seen my parents for one year. If my parents would come to Pittsburgh soon I and my family must be delighted to hear the message. I enjoy all kinds of variety.
