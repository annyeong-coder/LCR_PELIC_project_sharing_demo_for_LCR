It is hard to believe that the semester is almost over. Time is really flying though. Of course I have acquired a lot of acquisition however I stretched myself out from head toe. After three months of studying I am assessing myself that How well did I do I had several principal goals to reach when I started the ELI class and one of aspect of them was the enhancement of the vocabularies which I use. Initially I started with basic range of vocabulary knowledge but through this semester at the ELI it improved considerably. I can proudly say that I achieved to my targeted goal however a lot to do more in the future. Despite studying it was fun time to spend with my international friends at the ELI. It is a little bit sad that I can not meet with them every day like I sad to do through this semester. Can you imagine that students who are from all different cultures race incorporated in one class and English was connecting us. Therefore this is the one of appreciative aspects of English however we struggled to study a lot during this ridiculous language. Can not believe we turned so many chapters of new knowledge and can not forget to thank for generous our teachers. Although it was a lot of pressure however it was very efficient time which I spent.
