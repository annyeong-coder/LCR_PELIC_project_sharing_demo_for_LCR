It was three years ago. At the time my university classmates and I were having a graduate trip in Bali Island. We tried one of their most famous meals the dirty duck. It was the best but also the worst meal we had in Bali. The dirty duck was not really dirty. The waiter said that when the store was established the boss couldn't find a proper name for this duck meal. One day he saw ducks playing in farm and they were very dirty. That was where the name came from. The process of making the meal was simple to image. The chief put ducks into an oven and toasted them to become golden and crisp. After that those ducks were served with a secret sauce. Therefore the dirty duck was very delicious. However at night most of us felt getting butterflies in our stomach. Was that because of the dirty duck or another meal We had no evidences. Therefore in my opinion the dirty duck was the concoction of the best and also the worst food I have ever tried.
