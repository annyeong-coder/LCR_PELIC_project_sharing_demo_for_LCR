My teacher of writing class asked us to choose one from two classmates to cooperate with him for all activities that we do in the class. For instance when we work on editing paragraphs or analysis an essay my teacher always asks us to work in group because that has many advantages. It was after I compared and contrasted two students ANON_NAME_0 and ANON_NAME_1 that I finally decided to choose ANON_NAME_1 as a partner. At first ANON_NAME_0 and ANON_NAME_1 have a lot of things in common. Both ANON_NAME_0 and ANON_NAME_1 are cooperative students. They always help anyone in the class who needs help. Also ANON_NAME_0 is as studious as ANON_NAME_1. For example ANON_NAME_0 always asks questions and he always does his homework. ANON_NAME_1 is a good note taker and he always tries to get perfect score on his tests. Actually I knew these things about them because they have the same classes as me. Although they have many things in common there are several differences between them. In so far as personality while ANON_NAME_1 is shy ANON_NAME_0 is a social person. Also ANON_NAME_0 is from Libya but ANON_NAME_1 is from Korea. So ANON_NAME_0's native language is Arabic however ANON_NAME_1's native language is Korean. ANON_NAME_0 speaks very fast but ANON_NAME_1 speaks slowly. In conclusion after I analyzed the similarities and differences between ANON_NAME_0 and ANON_NAME_1 I think I chose the right person as a partner. Working with a partner from different country with a different culture and a different language has many advantages such as the exchange of information about culture. The most important advantage about working with a partner is that we have to use the English language to understand each other. I found all of these things in ANON_NAME_1 so I chose ANON_NAME_1 as a partner.
