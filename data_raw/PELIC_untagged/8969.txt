I have many friends who are living in Turkey. Some of them who I met at university are living in Ankara which is capital of Turkey. Also others who are living in my home city have been my friends since childhood middle and high school's years. Some of my friends who have already gotten married have started to worked and some of them who are stil student are living abroad. Moreover some of my friends whose husband I have already known got married my other friends.
