I agree a quotation which is Friendship is a plant which we must often water. I think that friendship needs give and take. If I can get something from my friend I want to give something to my friend. So we can motivate each other. I have some best friends who give me good influences. One of them whose name is Kanako. Our friendship has continued since senior high school students. When we were senior high school student she encouraged me. There is for example When I didn't have motivationof study for math which was my dislike subject. She talked to me that importace stydying of math so I could have motivation it. I try to it and if I have chaces for her I want to give good advice for her.
