When I go to a desert island I have to take a flashlight because I can see everything at night. In addition I had better prepare batteries for the flashlight. Another thing I must take a knife. I am able to cut a cooking ingredient. I could cook. Also I should take matches. I do not think I would have trouble eating in the Desert Island.
