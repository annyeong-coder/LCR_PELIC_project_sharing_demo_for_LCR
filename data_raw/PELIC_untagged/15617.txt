It is a nice thing to make your bed tidy when you wake up in the morning. It makes you feel that everything is neat. It is easy to make your bed if you follow the right steps. First cover the bed with a fitted sheet. Second put a bed sheet over the fitted sheet. Third tuck the sides under the mattress. Then insert the pillows inside the pillows sheet and put them on the head of the bed. After that spread the comforter over the sheets and pillows. Finally put some decorative pillows on the upper end of the bed. I like to make my bed every day. It makes me relax and gives me a good feeling every morning. For that reason my youngest sister started to make her bed when she knew about my morning mood secret.
