Since I'm here in USA I've had insomnia. So usually I stay awake until 3 am. This is really making me look tired all day but doesn't matter how long or tiring is my day I take a long time to sleep. Today I tried to found some solutions for my problem and I found some information in the ANON_URLSPAGE_of them that I'll try is take a warm shower and drink warm milk before sleep. Other option is listen music until sleep. But if this doesn't work I must see a doctor to found my insomnia's origin.
