Recently Becky my listening teacher in the ELI let the class show a film known as one of the American movie classics. It was The Wizard of Oz filmed in 1939. The story is about an adventure of a Kansas girl Dorothy and her dog Toto on their journey finding the wizard of Oz living in an Emerald city to ask for getting them back home after getting transported to somewhere due to the curse of a bad witch. Even though it was an old movie the special effects of which was not fabulous as much as recent Hollywood movies I loved it having a lot of fun from its dorable visual effects like scary wood where the castle of a bad withc is located the Munchikin land where small people called Munchikin lived and the way characters such as a tin man a crowman and a lion dress up and face up. I want to watch it again when I have children in the future. I guess they will love it too.
