I do not feel good all day because I have difficulty in getting deep sleeping. It is really serious for me. This has been happening to me a lot lately. I go to bed around midnight but I lay there awake until 3 or 4 am. For that reason I can not think or keep from yawning in class. Moreover I'm too tired to do anything productive. There are several tips to get to sleep faster. First or all I should drink warm milk before bedtime instead of coffee. I usually drink too much coffee a day. Donald R. Townsend 2006 stated Caffeine acts as an adenosine receptor antagonist. Adenosine is a substance in your body that promotes sleepiness. Caffeine blocks the adenosine receptor to keep you from feeling sleepy. Warm milk might be good for soothing tired mind and helping me relax. Secondly I ought to take regular exercise. According to David C. Nieman 2005 compared with those who avoid exercise physically fit people claim that they fall asleep more rapidly sleep better and feel less tired during the day. For example exercise such as yoga might help prepare my body for sleep. Finally I could create a comfortable sleep environment. Before I go to bed I should make my room enough dark. For example I might pull the curtains closed and screen lights from electrical equipment in my bedroom. In addition I should remove my clock not to look the time because I feel anxious. Therefore if I follow these tips I will be able to improve my sleep problem and overcome my sleeplessness. References Townsend Donald R.
