When I was a high school student. My parent's traveled on business suddenly. Seriously I had no money couldn't make foods anything. Anyway I had a little puppy. The dog had been eating only high quality feeds but my home's feed ran out. I couldn't make a meal neither could I buy some foods for my dog during 5 days. Also I had a meal just little bit and I didn't attend a school because I had no money. Poorly my puppy became skinny so I gave some rice including only water to the dog. My dog eat very well. It was amazing. I fixed my puppy's finicky eating habits.
