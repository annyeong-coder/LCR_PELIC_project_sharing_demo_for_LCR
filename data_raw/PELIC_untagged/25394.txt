Roben Hood was last movie I sae it which it was one of the most good movies. It took three hours long and they speak by British English which was hard to me to understand every thing. That day the movie theater was crowded most of who were there want to see Roben Hood because we went there on Friday 14 may which it was first show. The movie was talking about some wars between France and England which they were strongest countries in Europe that time.
