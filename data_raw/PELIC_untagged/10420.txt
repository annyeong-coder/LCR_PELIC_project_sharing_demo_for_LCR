I feel comfortable when I am in my room. One day I figured out my wall color was pale violet. It has calmed me down without noticing. I usually like everything organized. So I straighten up the things and put similar stuffs together. I thought over about moving the bed around but I turned it down because it didn't worth it. However when I felt my room was dark I lighted up the room with a lamp then I cleaned up the window for more sunlight. I also put the mirror on to make my room bigger. After making out my room it wore me out but I was happy to finish it. Now I like my room way it is.
