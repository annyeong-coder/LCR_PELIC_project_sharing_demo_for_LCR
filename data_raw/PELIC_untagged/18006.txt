The total students of the Springfield Academy are growing every year. There are two groups of students at this place the first group is American students and the other group is foreign students. All of these groups are represent the total number of students. The number of students does not remain the same at changing the years it changes from the year to other year. From 1992 to 1996 the number of American students increased and the increasing percentage in the American students was greater than the foreign students. Over against the number of foreign students remained the same from 1992 to 1996. In the year 1996 exactly the number of foreign students equaled to the number of American students it was 100 students. After this year the increasing percentage in the foreign students raised and the percentage of the American students was fewer than the foreign students. From 1999 to 2000 the number of foreign students remained the same it equaled 150 students. After year 2000 the numbers of foreign students increased but this increasing in these students was less than the increasing in the American students. For example in year 1999 there were twice as many foreign students as American students. You can see now the foreign students represent such a large percentage of the student body I think that the school must development the activities which give to their student because they are from different countries and they have many cultures.
