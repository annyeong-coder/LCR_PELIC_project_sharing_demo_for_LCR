Last Friday my friend and I went to the chinese restaurant located in down town. When I opened the door I smelled my favorite sauce which is Szechuan . The smell makes me ravenous even if I feel full. Szechuan sauce in this restaurant has a unique flavor different from other chinese restaurants that I tried from them . I usually order Szechuan shrimp with steamed rice. They served it with different kind of vegetables . That makes the dish more colorful like brown sauce's color orange yellow and green. In a while I heard sh sound coming towards us . It was grilled fish the second dish we ordered it the smoke went out from the plate it was hot. I unconsciously touched it and I felt a little bit sting on my skin. But it was so delicious. I like chinese restaurants especially this restaurant because they offer something special and I like their decoration too. It is fabulous.
