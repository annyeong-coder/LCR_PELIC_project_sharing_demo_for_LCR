Dear Mr. ANON_NAME_0 Thank you for taking the time to provide me with great information at Hillman library last Friday. I certainly appreciate your effort in explaining how to use the library database to search for valid articles relevant to the topics of interest. I'm now able to find specific information in a more profession way. Thank you again for your time and consideration. Sincerely ANON_NAME_1 Last Name ELI Student
