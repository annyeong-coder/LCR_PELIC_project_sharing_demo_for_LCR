A Chinese adage says Gentles' friendships are like pure water which means friends should not be too close but be polite and gentle to each other. That is also the way that I treated my friends so most of my friendships were simple and dull. But I still have some best friends whom I can share opinions and feelings with. I met one of my best friends Ryan when I was fifteen. I thought he was the weirdest guy who I had ever met at that moment and what he was thinking was exactly the same. Both of my friend and I are the people who love imaging and creating things in an unusual way. But we usually have different opinions about what we are discussing. Some people said a friend is someone who has the same interests or personality. Ryan and I have the same interests such as sports and making money. Most of the times that we spent together were sharing ideas and opinions about business and sports. We spent hours talking and chatting with each other when we served at different military bases. It is really a good thing that someone can talk to and help you figure out the problems in your lives. Right now I am studying in the U. S. And he is working in Mainland China. It is hard to make a phone call but we still send messages and keep in contact with each other. I think I will keep doing this for years with this guy whose thought is as equally strange as mine.
