Last Saturday was ELI Night which is a typical ELI celebration and my friend and I ate foreign food and we took a lot of photos each other. I should have eaten more because one hour later I was hungry however the food had finished. When ELI Night ends my classmates went to a place to drink something but they forgot telling me when I knew I thought they must have gone fast but they might have called me. After one hour they called me and they said we must have called you before but we had a problem and I thought they should have had a big problem then I said Ok where are you . Finally I went to the place and I spent a really good time with my friends.
