One month ago I watched a movie about Louis Kahn My Architect. This movie excited and fascinated me because I got an introduction to the projects of Mr. Kahn. Some movies are disappointing but My Architect was very interesting. The buildings designed by Kahn surprised the viewers with the geometric forms. In the beginning of the movie I was confused because the narrator was disappointed with his father. But I enjoyed this exciting and amazing movie.
