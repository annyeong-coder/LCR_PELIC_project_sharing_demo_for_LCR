I think they expect the movie of bat man will start filming in Pittsburgh so they have started interviewing with extras from Pittsburgh. There are a lot of nominees such as Williams Josh Korzendorfer and Kersty. They want chance to act even the smallest part in the movie. The students of filming department in Point Park University are trying to get some action behind cameras. Making the movie in Pittsburgh is great chance to make this city is more popular. For example in 1914 movies have started filming in Pittsburgh so hundreds of thousands have been employed as extras. They are offering 58 for eight hours in addition to overtime. Science 1977 Batman Movie has started but it wasn't anticipate to be a big draw when it was released. This movie bat man wasn't attractive for adult's long time ago but the movie Star wars changed that kind of ideas.
