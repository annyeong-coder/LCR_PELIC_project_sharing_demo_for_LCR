Actually this is the first time I hear about Leisureville. It is wonderful place like a dream to have fun and relax. Every one they have a long time to ponder. Also in that place they have facility for an assisted care. It is amazing place if you are their would to pinch yourself to now if that real or not. All people their senior citizen retirement widower and widow. In my opinion I do not like to live in that place. Becouse it is boring place quiet and no children. The situation in my country completly different. The senior citizen live in house with their family and around them the children. Also the senior citizen tell us stories about the past live and custom. We enjoy with them and love it.
