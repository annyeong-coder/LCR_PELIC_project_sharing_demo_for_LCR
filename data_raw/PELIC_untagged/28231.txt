Today which is the vote day in the usa where I live I have been to the school where I study for 2months for taking the class that peter who has shaved his beard for donating the cancer organization that is in Austrlia teaches grammar which is my favorite part of English. But grammar that is also my weak part of English is too hard to study. So I who is the best lazy student in my class that is 4Q was sleeping during the lecture that is about adjective clauses.
