Our group decided to bring fresh water ax compass fishing equipment map of the area. Because if we don't have fresh water we couldn't live many days and although we bring some food it has a limit so we have to catch our food. In addition we have to protect by ourself and to make boat to escape this island. So we need ax. Last of all even if we can succeed escape we have to know where we have to go. So we need map of the area.
