Initially I didn't determine to go to America originally. After I finished my job I should have finded the job in Taiwan but I didn't do it. After my fist job I though that I wouldn't stop studying. I could expand my vision and improve my English level. It was a dilemma for me. I needed to give up working payment and spent much money to study Englsih. I would have thought it carefully but I maked the decision very quickly. Because I known that poor English was my weakness if I hadn't faced it it would have been a regret for me. I didn't know this decision was right or not but I known that I needed to study hard. I wasted too much time on unmeaning things before and I could have used my time well. Anyway I'm here I should use my time well and I look forward to having a new future.
