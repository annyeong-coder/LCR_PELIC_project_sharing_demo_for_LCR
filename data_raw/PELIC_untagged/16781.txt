The meaning of eco tourism which is for protecting the environment is good. However I don't think people don't harm nature at all when they are traveling although they don't intend it. In the case of a forest if people have walked for a long time a road is made. Even if they don't have a thought which is about making a road the environment is changed and harmed. Moreover I don't think every tourist wants to follow the rule which is for protecting nature. If this kind of people is increased the eco tourism can be a mediation of destruction of nature.
