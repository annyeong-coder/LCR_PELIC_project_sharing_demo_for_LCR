My long weekend which I had with my friend was hunting trip in 1999 at the desert environment. In our foreseeable the trip will be safety because we toke all procedures which will dethrone ourselves from fierce animals. We aspired to get some deer after arriving at the area that we should launch hunting we were waiting to become night. At the beginning our hunting has been an unqualified success without disruption we got two deer. But not at all post two hours we got lost because we lost our compass then my friend who was culprit acknowledged his culprit humorously. In this status we have dilemma so we have to wait until morning without food or come back without camps after an argument we decided come back via following stars then we arrived the started point. Honestly I considered this adventure as a cumulative experience for me.
