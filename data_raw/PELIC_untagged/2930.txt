Title Spring in Lebanon Indent Spring season in Lebanon is like living in Heaven. The sky is as clear and blue as the ocean. The weather is fabulous the smooth wind makes the trees dance and the flowers clap and the light rain is like a renaissance for the plants which grow in this season. On top of this you can enjoy walking because the ground is like a long green carpet which seems like the perfect place to be during spring because the weather is great outdoor activities become very popular like picnics during the weekend associated with tasty barbeques and when the weather is great all the beaches and pools open their doors for visitors who enjoy water activities especially swimming which is very popular in Lebanon during spring and summer. This atmosphere make you feel satisfied and hoping that this weather last for ever. Spring is better than summer because it's a warm season where the temperature is moderate not too cold and of course not too hot. That is why people prefer to enjoy their outdoor activity during spring time. This nice weather has a positive influence on tourism because tourists can go skiing in the mountains which are not far from the beach. Then when they get bored they can go down to the beach. Spring is the only season which allows people to practice winter and summer's sports together such as skiing swimming and a lot others. For all the reason above Lamartine who is a very famous French artist said that Lebanon's nature is like heaven on the earth and he expresses his opinion in a poem student still studying it until now. This gift from God for the Lebanese people is appreciated by Lebanese and non Lebanese people who visit it. Finally Spring is my best season everywhere I live but I think that Lebanon has this specific nature during spring and the sky the sun the beaches the wind the mountains and the ground make you feel that you are living in an ideal place in a perfect weather just like HEAVEN.
