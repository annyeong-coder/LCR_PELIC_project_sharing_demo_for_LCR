I've already called my friends but I haven't called your friends yet. I've already cleaned the pool but I haven't cleaned the chairs yet. I've already bought beer but I haven't gotten the whiskey yet. I 've already prepared for the food but I haven't prepared the drinks. I've already done all my work for the party could you check what we've already done and to do I haven't time to checked yet. I guess we've already most of the work done but maybe we've forgotten something.
