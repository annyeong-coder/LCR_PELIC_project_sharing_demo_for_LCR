I'm very like my elementary school fifth and sixth grade's teacher. She was very important to me. She taught me how to get good grades and how to memorize the thing important in the text book. She also taught me some polite words in some different situation. I remembered once when she came in the class I was sleeping. That time she told me to stand whole class and I knew that's my falls. Anyway I learned a lot from her.
