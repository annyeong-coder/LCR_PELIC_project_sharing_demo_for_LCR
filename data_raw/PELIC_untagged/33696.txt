Do friends have to be people who have the same interests or personality I don't think so. My friend ANON_NAME_0 and I are best friends who are complete opposites. He is shy who can not walk into a room that is full of strangers. He lives in abha city. Abha city which is a very exciting place is too small. ANON_NAME_0 who is working in university is very athletic and goes to Gym everyday. We have graduated from king ANON_NAME_1 university since 2010. We like to travel together for tourism although we are opposites. Next summer we will go another trip that sounds great. We intent to visit Dubai which is a place he knows a lot about.
