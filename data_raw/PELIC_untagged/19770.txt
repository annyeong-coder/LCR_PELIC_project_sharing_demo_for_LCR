Last weekend I went to IKEA to buy a table with my husband. IKEA triggered a memory of the time when I had started living in Pittsburgh. At that time we didn't have a car so I traveled to the place by bus and I felt inconvenient and exhausted to look around there without a car. I thought how giant the place was! Now we have a car and we can access anywhere in Pittsburgh easily. We had already decided what we buy before I went there. However unfortunately the table was sold out. So we had to go back there two weeks later. I was anticipating getting the new table and coordinating my living room autumnally so I was a little disappointed. As a small consolation I went to see puppies in the neighbor pet store. Then I looked around the neighbor mall but I couldn't find something special. After I finished shopping I had a dilemma about dinner. I was a little tired after shopping and wanted to go a restaurant but I wanted to eat Japanese food which I cannot find in a restaurant. I asked my husband which he liked but his answer was ambiguous. After all we went back home and cooked the Japanese food.
