In my mind there is one word no one could ever define and no one knows why because happiness is a feeling which many simple things could bring about. Children can find their happiness in new toys and sweets which may not cheer a younger heart longing to be beloved. However being surrounded by my beloved family having many trustful friends and feeling the accomplishment in life are the keys to my heart. As a result I always feel glad to have such happy days in my lifetime. It is a grace to have my adored family who always stands by my side. They are here where nobody is around celebrating my finest moments and telling me not to give up in my hardest times. Furthermore they are standing behind to support me when I fall down. Now how could I not be happy when I feel the spring in my heart Sharing a secret with a trustful friend has unique taste of joy and cheerfulness. Not only sharing some secrets but sharing moments enjoyment sadness and even a bad day with a friend can make me always feel better. It has taught me to give rather than to receive and that the kindness of giving could bring some happiness to a broken heart. Always strive to win another prize. Obviously nothing can give me such a feeling like this sensation of self fulfillment. Accomplishment always has its reflections on anyone's personality confidence pride and appreciation. Consequently they all come together to strengthen the power within. It means a lot to me to proceed and successes. In my belief happiness is not a beauty that you can see a song that you can hear or a sweet that you can taste. Happiness can only live inside a kind heart inspired by true love trust and pride. In fact it is here and wherever you go.
