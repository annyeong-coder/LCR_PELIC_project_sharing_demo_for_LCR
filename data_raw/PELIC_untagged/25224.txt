How I came to Pittsburgh I am in order to study English aboard. I spent half year search much information and ask many friends' advices. In result I decided to go to Pittsburgh. Because it has famous building and less Asia people. I first understand what transport tool I want to take. So I booked airline tickets and connected school and homestay. Then I applied visa and prepare to pack my baggage. I remembered that my most friend tell me they planned to study aboard and learn many things as language make friend international view etc. So I surfed the internet and compared many language school. My parents adviced me to not go to private school and find traffic transport is convenient. Finally I decided to Pittsburgh because it's bus is free. I started to book airline tickets. Because the airline continue to add money every week I booked the thickets whose path need to be transfer three times. I was in order to save money I took the method.
