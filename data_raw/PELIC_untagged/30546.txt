Yes I would like to live a nontraditional lifestyle. Three reasons make me prefer to live a nontraditional lifestyle. First Living in a nontraditional lifestyle allow me to PARTICIPATE with other people that not part of my culture. Second In LEISURE time I will find more places to hang out rather than traditional lifestyle and also to avoid ISOLATION life. Finally It is easy to find any thing I want such malls supermarkets airport and so on.
