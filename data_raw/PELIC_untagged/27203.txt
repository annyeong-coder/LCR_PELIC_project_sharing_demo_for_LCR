If I will go to live alone in a deserted island I will take with me much chocolate that I like it. Also I will take radio and some batteries to can replace the old batteries. I think I will find much water there so I'm not thinking to take much fresh water. I will take a lot of fishing equipment because I like to go fishing so I do not need any pasta or beans for food. I do not need any books or telescopes. I think I will take a few maps of the area to know the directions that I need it. I hope these thing will have benefits for me.
