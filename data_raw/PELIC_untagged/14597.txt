I broke up with my American girl friend last week. Since last week I have been thinking of what I had done wrong to her. I might have kept going on our relationship. What should I have told her the last time I saw her At that time I drank too much so still now I can not remember anything about that night. That night I checked my score of my recent Toefl exam. My score was so low so I was so sad. I just wanted to be drunk to forget everything. But I could have drunk alone or I ought to have gone to my room early. But at that time I missed her too much. So I called her to come to me. I should not have called her. Otherwise I ought to not have check my Toefl score that day.
