Lately in my country air pollution is a big problem. Because of the air pollution people and animals are damaged and we are living with many difficulties. Even though government is trying to solve those problems actually it is hard to find fundamental solutions. I think to reduce the air pollution in my country we should decrease the number of cars and give some information to the people and establish some organizations. First of all we should decrease the using of cars. Theses days many people have and use their cars. I think cars are the most cause of pollution. Instead of cars government should recommend people to take public transportation or bicycles. And Government should establish a law that people can not use their cars once a week. Secondly government should give some information to the people. Many people know the air pollution but they do not know serious of pollution well. Knowing the problems is too important to find solutions. So to give some information government should offer some advertisements to the people through the media. And in school for students government should teach them how to preserve the environment. Thirdly government should establish some organizations.
