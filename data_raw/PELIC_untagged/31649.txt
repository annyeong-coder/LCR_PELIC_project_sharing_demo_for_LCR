Nowadays using cell phone is a big part of our living. We carry our cell phone everywhere and hold it on every time. Although we can't deny the cell phone's inevitable effect in our lives we should prohibit using cell phones in classroom. To begin with some people claim that using cell phones should be allowed in classroom because of emergency situation. In fact cell phone will play significant roles in many situations. However that is emergency situation. It means that the situations happen rarely. Especially in classroom if the students have an emergency notice such as their family's car accident or someone's death their parents would call to the dean or their children's teacher. That's because the parents should explain about the crisis if they want to take their children home. This point directly contradict the some people's claim that we shouldn't prohibit the use of cell phones in class room. In addition if we prohibit the use of cell phones it would help our students focus on their class. One of the main distractions in classroom is the use of cell phones. Students enjoy web surfing such as twitting or doing face book during classes. The serious problem is that other students could be affected by someone's distraction with cell phone including ringtone sound from chatting. As a result the whole class's performance could be lower. In sum if we care about our students learning environment we should prohibit the use of cell phones in classroom.
