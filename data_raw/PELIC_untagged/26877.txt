The author states that when she was in kindergarten she was really 'creative'because she could draw and make what she wanted to and felt enjoyment and happiness. Those are believed to be an inherent part of creativity freedom of creation and happiness from it. However the author says that when she entered a school of higher grade she had to do waht her teacher said. I totally agree with her. When children are forced to 'study' they can hardly feel freedon and happiness. The study is just their duty even music or art. In Korea to enter the university is very hard so Korean students are under severe competition. So some students kill themselves not to overcome the pressure that they must get a good grades and go to a good school. I was one of them. I had had to 'study' which was close to memory or copy something in many text books and of course I forget everything. I don't think I was creative. But as I could do what I want I felt I was 'creative' and sense of achievement. Eventually creativity comes from the human nature that explores new world and develops original idea. Therefore to educate students creativity first they have to learn to be free to find what they want while enjoying the process.
