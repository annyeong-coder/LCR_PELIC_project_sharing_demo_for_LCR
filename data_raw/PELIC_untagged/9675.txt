One of my pleasures is having an airplane meal whenever I travel abroad. We can enjoy typical national cuisines on a flight. In fact Asian airplane companies have placed much importance on their meals as part of their services these days. However the worst meal experience I've ever had was also an airplane meal. When my husband and I flied from Tokyo to the US seven months ago we were so exhausted and hungry on the flight because of hard work in Tokyo. We felt like eating anything served. A short time later after takeoff we were served a meal. The main dish was lasagna and the side dishes were cooked salad with shrimp cocktail and bread. The dessert was a piece of chocolate cake. All of them looked perfect and we felt relaxed in front of the meal. However we lost our appetite as soon as we tasted each of them. Lasagna was not warm and its pasta was solid at the bottom of the plate. In addition the cooked salad was bland and the bread was too dry to eat. Finally my hope was pinned on the dessert. I was sure that I liked any kinds of sweets and they would help us to relieve our fatigue. Unfortunately the piece of chocolate cake disappointed my expectations. I felt that the chocolate cake was made of only sugar. That was more harm than good for us! At the same time I noticed my husband frown at the leftover. After our plates were cleaned up one of cabin attendants started to serve something again. As I didn't pay attention to her a small bag was suddenly thrown to me. It was peanuts that I hated most! Why didn't she hand it me Needless to say her attitude toward passengers made the airplane meal more disgusting. We decided to sleep and thought it was to dream of Japanese cuisine if there was any solace.
