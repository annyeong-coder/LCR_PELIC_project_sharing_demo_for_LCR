MY WRITING HABITS I think that a comfortable environment can make me study better. For example before I'm going to study I always do exactly the same things because I need to have concentration. I need to study with a clean desk and chair notebook pencil pen and highlighter. Also I have to change my clothes and I wear sweat pants and a sweat shirt. And I make a cup of tea with milk. However I can study in different places in the house sometimes I study in the bedroom and sometimes I study in the dining room. But I need bright light warm temperature and the place should be quiet. I like to study in the early afternoon around 3 p. M. Because after I can go to bed early around 10 p. M. But I study when I can. Then I can start to study and first I do the homework for that day and after I study grammar writing listening speaking and reading if I have a test. My methods to study are write and rewrite the information highlight important ideas in the book and read new ideas several times. For example when I have a test I like to read more about the grammar reading writing speaking and listening tests I don't only read the information the teacher tells in class. In conclusion when I go to study I need to be prepared and then I can start.
