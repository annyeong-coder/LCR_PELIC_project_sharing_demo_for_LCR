I chose the topic In your opinion what are the advantages and disadvantages of learning how to cook your own meals I think that are more advantages than disadvantages of learning how to cook my own meal. First to cook is a challenge because many people don't know or don't have capable for cook so they can learn to cook. Second cook my own meal is healthy because I don't use many calories or I can cook meal more diet such as a diet of fish an vegetables. The last I think that cooking is more cheaper than eating out although to cook has many process of gettig a good meal. Only one disadvantage is that I can spend a lot of time for cooking while if I buy ready meals I don't spend time.
