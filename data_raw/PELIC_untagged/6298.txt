In these days United States have had the control of the world therefore this is the most powerful country in the world. Also the country has a god economy and there are too many opportunities for the people so there are three main reasons why I decided to live in the U. S. To learn English to study in a good university and to get a good job. One of the main reasons to live in the US is to learn English. I have studied English in my country and it's good but if I want to speak English better I need to practice with Americans. In addition I can enter to a good school of English like the ELI and to meet new people and make a lot of friends. The second reason is to study in a good university. The United States have the best universities like Harvard Stanford University of Pittsburgh Carnegie Mellon and more. If you study here you can be more prepared but sometimes study here is too expensive. In this case you can get a scholarship if you are a good student and it's easier to pay the expenses. My last reason to live in the US is to get a good job. I can find a good job because United States have a great economy so the jobs are paid very well. These are only a few reasons to live in the US but can have more although sometimes it's difficult to be far of your family or your friends. I know that if you do an effort to be more prepared you will have more success in the life.
