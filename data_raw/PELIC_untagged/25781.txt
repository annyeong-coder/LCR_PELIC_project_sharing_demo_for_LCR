Marge got upset but Homer was trying with her they went to see a movie but it was noisy inside the theatre so they decided to go skating. Then they founded that it was curling but they were excited to try it. During that time they met Seymour and his mother who dropped by their house next day to tell them about the Winter Olympic Trails. Surprisingly they won the competition so they were chosen to represent the U. S. In 2010 Vancouver Games. In Vancouver Bart was snowboarding with friends but Lisa was addicted to buy olympic pins. She wanted them so badly that she traded her pearls away to get one more pin. Meanwhile Seymour and his mother were talking to Marge about taking Homer off the team. For this reason Marge and Homer were trying so hard to win the game but Marge was hurt and could not play. Also Lisa was getting worse in her addiction to pins and Bart was trying to help her. He took away all the pins and helped her get her pearls back. At the last minute Marge decided to continue playing and because of her the U. S. Team was the first winner in Vancouver Winter Games.
