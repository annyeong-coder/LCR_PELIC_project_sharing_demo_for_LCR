One Sunday some time ago I was sleeping in my bed when the ringing of my cell phone wake me up it was early maybe 7 Am. I pick up my phone and answered the call. I was so lethargic that didn't check the number. A strange voice started to talk me into buy a product or something I don't remember what was. I didn't figure out anything and just hang up the phone and back to bed. Just 2 minutes later the phone ringing again the guy call me back and go over with the same story about buy something I was so upset for everything and didn't think over just turned off my phone and returned to sleep.
