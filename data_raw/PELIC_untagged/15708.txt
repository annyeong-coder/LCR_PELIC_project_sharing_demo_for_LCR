I like my classroom. But to be honest I would straighten the room up. First the classroom should be cleaned up. Students must move desks around and put chairs away. Moreover people who has classes in the room must do cleaning over regularly. Also I would touch up the interior for example would hang up some pictures and light up a room. I want to throw old magazines and papers away from the classroom. That all makes up a good stimulating atmosphere for learning English.
