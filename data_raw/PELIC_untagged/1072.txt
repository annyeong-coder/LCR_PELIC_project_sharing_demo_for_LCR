DINO I've to take matches because we need to cook foods. With matches we can start a fire. TRISH I agree with you. The foods are an important thing for our lives. DINO So we have to choose matches. That is the first one. Should we choose a toothbrush TRISH No we shouldn't. I think we are able to find something on the island for cleaning our teeth. DINO I think so. We should have a knife. TRISH Why do you think we should have a knife DINO Because with a knife we can cut small woods or prepare foods. TRISH Yes and with small woods we could get warm. It might be wood fuel. DINO Exactly. Now we have to choose another one. TRISH What do you think if we have got to take some chocolate DINO I think that's not good idea. We might not be useful for us. TRISH But I think we may not find some foods in the first day so we could eat some chocolate. DINO That's good idea. I agree with you. TRISH Now we are able to choose three things to bring with us to a desert island. We have matches knife and chocolate.
