For students writing is an overwhelming and pain which they face when working . Heni Nouwen wrote about writing in his book Seeds of Hope . That explain how is writing difficult to student. I agree with his ideas that are writing is often the source of great pain and true writing requires writing more than just ideas but rather releasing what in your heart. Writing is the source of pain and stress. Students have a hard time to believe their own creative mind. Without confidence it is not true to stay without Strain. There are many source that have things you could talk about it and make it difficult and try to rewrite what is written down. Student think when they write about something was written before they will not make it perfect and they think why we wrote it and someone ales made it professional. For me I think if they try more and more they will overcome the pain and stress. Writing Necessitate writing more than ideas it's about what are you feeling your heart. Sometimes we write what we feel about something and that make it improving not just put the idea down also its discover our experience about the life. Writing is like a encyclopedia so when you write in our feeling that true writing. Many teacher advise students to write what they want but students do not know the meaning form that. It could help them to improve their skills in writing and feel comfortable when they start writing. In summary I think believe in your thought and ideas its being to write them creatively is a the key of best writing also practicing in writing will improve your skills. When you write the ideas think what about your feeling and write it that could help you to discover yourself. In my opinion writing needs to daily exercise to develop your skills and read more and more to learn a lot of style of writing .
