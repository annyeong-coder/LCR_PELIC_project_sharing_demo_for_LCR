The story talks about the history and the evolution of martini. It's made of gin and dry vermouth. It was invented in America and has become an icon. Martini was popular in urban areas and it defined cool and modern. Its popularity faded in the late 1960s and 70s because of reduced expense account dining the growth of health food stores and the appearance of other mind altering substance. The classic cocktails made a comeback in the 1980s. New types of martinis with flavored vodka and fruit purees have become common in bars with loud music. According to the writer E. B. White this is wrong because the drink should be an elixir of quietude.
