The building which I grew up located in Xiaoyi city China. Many people who were working in the coal factory lived in this building. It is a 3 bed room apartment on the fourth floor. Because I only have a sister who is 2 year older than me I can have my own bedroom where I slept and studied. We moved there in 1987 when I went into elementary school. In my room there was a big window which I could watch outside through. My bed which is on the left side of window was very comfortable. All the stuffs in the bed were blue which is my favor color. I could relax in it. I put a Baby bear whose eyes can blink in my bed. It was a birthday gift form Miss Li whom my mother worked whit. Also there was a mirror that is beside the bed. I could organize my clothes before I went to school. There was a desk which I often studied on with Xiaoming whose father is my father's friend and ANON_NAME_0 whom I used to play with opposite the bed. I lived there for 10 years. I missed there very much.
