The life in the US is dangerous especially ah the night. When I was on a road after the midnight many of my friends advised me not to hang around without a car. I didn't understand why they told me like that because many people in Korea don't care about hanging around at the night. Being outside at night in Korea is not really dangerous. Most people can't have a gun individually. Also I even have experience that I was outside every after midnight during two weeks. And people can also have a travel without any plan and money. They can have sleep on a road with a tent. Many people who live in the countryside can sometimes give traveler a room for a night and some food for free. In the US I have to take care of myself for being here.
