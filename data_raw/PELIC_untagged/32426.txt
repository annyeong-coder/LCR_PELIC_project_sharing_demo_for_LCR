Nawwarah Al farwan Feb 28 2012 Writing 4 Humans discovered a lot of things that improved their lives over the last years. In my perspective technology is the most important invention among them. Technology enhances the development of the health social and education sectors in many ways. First technology is ever increasing in health sectors. Many technologies have discovered. For example MRI is the most beneficial device for investigating the brain diseases. Moreover the technology facilitates many operations by using telecommunication. These kinds of operations are very complex and some countries do not have the ability to perform it. Thus it is obvious that the technology plays a critical role in saving human life. Second education has improved since 100 years ago. Technology has been playing a crucial role in education by providing many beneficial resources. For example computer has a lot of websites that have a huge amount of information that are assisting graduated students in scientific researches. Finally technology facilitates communication among family members even if they are living far away. This communication did not exist in previous years. For instance twitter facebook and messenger are the most popular networks among people. In conclusion technology is the best invention in today's world. Education health and social sectors benefit the most from the technology development. Thus I highly recommend increasing the speed of technology development in the developing countries to provide the best life for their people too.
