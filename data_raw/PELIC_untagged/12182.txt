I have a sister whose name is Dorothy. She is two years younger than I. We have living together for 22 years. We have been growing up under the same parents. Even though my sister and I were born from the same parents we have a lot of differences. First both look young. When people see us they think we are just over 20 or below 20. It is an advantage of our family. Despite our childish faces our appearances are totally different. Even some people do not believe we are sisters. The biggest different appearance is eyes. I have a double eyelid but she does not. Second we have similar personalities. We enjoy talking to friends and joining clubs. And we are active persons who like playing outside. But our methods of solving problem are different. When we are facing a problem I try to solve that with my friends or someone who can help me. But my sister tries to solve that by herself. Third our education courses are similar. We graduated from same elementary middle and high school except university. But our interests of studying are always different. I really like math and science. On the other hands my sister likes literature and language. Finally that reason makes us go to another university. In conclusion since we have differences of appearance the methods of solving problem and interests of studying people can probably distinguish between my sister and me.
