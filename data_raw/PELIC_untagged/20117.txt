My apartment is too white and monotonous so sometimes I feel bored. Unfortunately I can't cover the wall up with another color because I am a tenant but I can hang up some pictures. It will cheer me up. Also there is an ugly calendar hanging on the wall but I don't think it matches up with the wall well. So I will take it down. Generally Feng Shui says facing the east when you sleep is good for your health but my bed is not facing the east. So I am going to move around the bed toward the east. Also I will straighten up the beddings.
