I think Bakhtiari nomads are most unusual because their life styles are completely different from me. Firstly I can say that they and I live in different ages because they refuse modern life. I am used to modern life in other words I can not return traditional life. Secondly Iranian culture and Japanese one are also completely different. As most Jpanese people I am not familliar with Iran so it is more difficult to understand them than the ordinary people in Iran. Therefore It is very hard for me to imagine their life styles.
