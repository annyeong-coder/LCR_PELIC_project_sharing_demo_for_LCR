2Weeks ago I and my friends were invited to Philadelphia for meeting my cousins. My car was chosen for a means of transportation. We got there by driving for over 5hours. After meeting my counsins we wanted to go out to find something to eat because we were almost dying with hunger. It was about midnight. Unfortunately on the way to restaurant my car was hit by the car behind. We called a police officer quickly and we were being watched by several witness. We also called embulance because two of the people in the car hit us got injured. When police officer came my accident no. Was reported immediately. Fortunately none of us were injured seriously we were so shocked at that time. In case of my car it was broken the rear bumper so it will be supposed to be charged everything by the careless offense's insurance. Even if it was dangerous and not tiny accident I think that it was good experience for me.
