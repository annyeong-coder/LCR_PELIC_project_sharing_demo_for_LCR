On October 10 2011 my chidren and I created a time capsule. We buried it ander the oldest bed in my house. The capsule contains 8 items. Each item tells somthing about the lives we live tody For example we put a toy car a picture of my family some fabric made out of cotton several books a lot of tools two games a few coin tree cameras some jewelry six nail scissors. There is still a lot to learn from thes time capsule called the hardware of my family .
