I remember my boss in our company because I think he is the greatest engineer in our country. Do not be surprised at this. His name is ANON_NAME_0 Bani. I know he is the richest engineer in my country because he earns his position by working. First of all he let me work at a design office as a civil engineer despite knowing I worked at my university as a teacher. At the same time he made me learn the style of working as a designer. He made me work in a group with good engineers. He had me ask about any equation and he let me enter his office at any time and I got his documents to study any problem at work. He got me to be a good engineer because he knew that I was the first student in my group when I graduated. I promised him to be better than him in the future because this is my dream.
