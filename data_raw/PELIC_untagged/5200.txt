I think such a role of smell is not reasonable. There are a thesis on the relation of smell and to choose a soul mate but supporting ideas seem very weak. It depends on just immuno and odor types differences. There were no evidences of actual statistic results like analysis according to types of smell between married couples. Therefore this topic is very interesting but I can't fully agree with that.
