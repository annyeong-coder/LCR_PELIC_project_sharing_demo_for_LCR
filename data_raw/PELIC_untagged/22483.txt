Hi I'm ANON_NAME_0 Last Name . I have been building this wonderful website since last weekend. I wrote the first page to introduce myself. I was born in Dammam city which is located in Saudi Arabia. It is really a nice area because of the beach. Fortunately I have gotten scholarship from Saudi's government. Then I moved to the US for studying. I have been working on getting a good score in TOEFL exam for one month also I have been studying in the ELI since I left my country. Consequently I have learned lots of things and my English has improved amazingly and fast. My social life is awesome. I have been always pragmatic and sensible. Last month I wanted to be married but I couldn't because my girlfriend's father hasn't approved about that yet I have experienced a lot of plays. One of these plays is soccer. I have always played this game for a long time. In conclusion I hope you will have fun when you see my special profile.
