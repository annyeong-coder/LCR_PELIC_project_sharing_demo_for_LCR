Eid Alfetr Saudi culture has great traditions and Eid Alfetr is one of the popular celebrations for Muslims. This holiday for celebrating when Muslims finish fasting Ramadan and it takes place on Shawal 1st of every year in the Arabic calendar. All families believe that wealthy and poor Muslims are alike when they feel hungry in Ramadan. In my hometown Riyadh preparation begins one week before the holiday with the purchase of new clothes preparation of Mosques and the construction of boards. To celebrate in the traditional way everyone purchase new clothes which has tradition impress. For that Women like to buy precious Jalabiyah which has wonderful color. Men sew special white Thowb and Gotrah boys too like to wear Thowb such grown. My Thowb was the greatest thing I had. Eid Alfetr prayer is the most important ceremony in that day. Begin processing mosques one week before Eid carpeted with new carpets and living space big enough worshipers. Early morning in 1st of Shawal Muslims meet to pray Eid Alfetr prayer and to congratulate each other. That is one of the finest moments. There is increased holiday joy when Muslims meet their families. Most families wish to see each other in Eid Alfetr and make huge board has traditional food. Some meals made especially for that day like Konafa some times you cannot imagine that taste. Celebration continued four days with a lot of ceremonies. Everyone has a great time with his family and spend time with friends. The new clothes and wonderful food are great memorial in the mind of everyone I still remember that last beautiful holiday in Pittsburgh.
