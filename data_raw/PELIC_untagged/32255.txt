My bedroom is dark and big. However I like it very much. Sometimes it brings me down but with this cold of Pittsburgh a dark room is not that bad. Actually my bedroom is not naturally dark I straightened it up because it has 3 windows and 1 of them is very big. So I put up blackouts which helped me a lot because now I can sleep until late without any light in my face. I have my books right beside my bed. It cheers me up now that I'm here I just look up for books in English. Maybe a thing that I could change in my room is in the next time pick out a colored blanket because I have everything in white. My bedroom is messy but I like is my organized mess. Another good idea would be hang up some photos in my wall. It would make me feel at home.
