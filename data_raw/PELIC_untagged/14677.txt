Recardo Hausmann and Bailey Klinger two economists developed a new way to describe world products. They were able to show the probability that if a country car exports a specific product it will also be able to export another product. Their data was transferred onto a network developed by a graduate student. The network shows world experts linked to the counties that produce them. The closer the exports are on the network the higher the probability they will be exported by the same country. The method developed by the economists will help others to understand the growth of companies and counties.
