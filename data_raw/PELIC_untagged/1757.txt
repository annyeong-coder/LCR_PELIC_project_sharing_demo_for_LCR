I evaluate Giant Eagle. First of all I consider convienence for people. Because most people want to be close from Giant Eagle to home. If Giant Eagle is far from home some people seems to give up to go to Giant Eagle. In addition after majority of people use up thier living goods go to purchase food beef fruit and comestic rolling papers. So they have to pick up heavy stuff for living. Second it is a big store for people. People wanna look around many products for buying previously goods. And It has to have variety goods for everyone. Because if there have a lot of varuety products customers wanna go to Giant Eagle to finding a product easily. And people do not have to go to other shopping mall or supermarkets for buying thier wanted products. Third Giant Eagle need quility customer service than now. Some employees are not kind to customers. So when I've shopped at Giant Eagle I've been strung out and nothingness about thinking employees. And when I have gone to change quaters at service customer they look me like a bagger. After I changed quaters I though they were the worst service men for me. Finally they must increase parking lot and garage. Because there are many cars from everywhere. Especilly weekend there are really many cars in Giant Eagle parking lot. So there ain't no parking place in parking lot or garage. They must make more garage and parking lot. In my conclusion Giant Eagle has some criteria for evaluating. I list all about criteria.
