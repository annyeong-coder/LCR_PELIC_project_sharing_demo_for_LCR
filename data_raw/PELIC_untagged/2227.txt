I agree and I don't agree. I agree when someone has a good luck and he works hard then he will success. Howrver alot of people have a good luck but they don't do any kind of interest. So they will not be succeessful peresons. On the other hand there are alot of people have a good talent and experiences but they don't do anything about themselves and there society. Unforthionatley most of those people have a wonderful luck but they don't do anything. I think those people are our problem in this world.
