I grew up in Saudi Arabia especially in Dammam city. Which is located at Arabic Gulf. Saudi Arabia changed at several aspects Such as the case of people between the past and now. Saudi Arabia didn't use to be rich country because it didn't have the resources of energy. Nowadays Saudi Arabia is one of rich countries in all over the world. Another aspect is relationships between Saudi Arabia and foreign countries. Saudi Arabia never used to have relationships or cooperation between another countries at a lot of things. For example education. But now it has cooperation with great countries such as USA England China France and Russia. One of important aspect is the citizens. They used to travel to another city or country by camel but now the go to anywhere by modern transportation. For instance car bus and airplane. Also they used to make the buildings by wood because they didn't have available materials to built as rich country. The last aspect is the right of woman. Woman used to drive the car in the dessert because sometimes they don't have man to drive the car So that they used to drive in order to get their necessary stuff. Now they don't drive because the governement issued new rules and a lot of punishments about woman driving. I hope they will drive in the future.
