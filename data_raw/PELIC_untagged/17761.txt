Last week one of my Turkish friend who is my brother's friend called me when the ELI activity in downtown was about to end up. I picked up the phone he told me 'let's meet and have a dinner' and I said 'I have an headache want to go home' but he talked me into it finally I said ok. And I added that I was in front of the seven eleven store which is closed to his restaurant. He told me 'keep on waiting there don't move I will pick you up in one minute' than he hang it up. After 5 minutes later he called me back and said that he coulnd't see me in front of seven eleven store and asked me what shops and buildings I see closed to it. When I answered his question we found out the problem and figured it out. I was in front of another seven eleven store which is another closed to his restaurant. How could I know there are two so closed seven eleven store. Finally he picked me up and had our dinner.
