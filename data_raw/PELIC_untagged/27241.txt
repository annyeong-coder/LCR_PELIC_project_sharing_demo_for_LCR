Each of us generate trashes so obviously we have to bring our contribution to the recycling. Having read the text about the recycling of tires I was very impressed by the noteworthy idea of the academics. By monitoring the consumption of tires a year the researchers made different proposals in order to recycle tires. For instance they have to recommend the use of used tires for the construction of dam as materials for houses. . . It is self explanatory that these methods are not expensive and that nobody going to reclaim the tires since it was abandoned. Therefore it is really beneficial at the same time for the environment and also for all the persons who want to curb their costs. In conclusion I was really enthusiastic by this text which shows dynamic persons pursuing their purpose to protect and to respect the environment.
