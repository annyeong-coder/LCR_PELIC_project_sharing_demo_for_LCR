Indent The Chinese New Year is very important to the Chinese. The date of the Chinese New Year is different every year because the date of the Chinese New Year is based on the lunar calendar. We celebrate the Chinese New Year for 15 whole days and each day has a different meaning for us. However the most important thing is the families need to get together during the Chinese New Year. I remember when I was a child I loved the Chinese New Year a lot because during the Chinese New Year I could visit relatives with my families and I was delighted to see my relatives. We could also travel everywhere we wanted during this Chinese New Year this made me enjoy charming scenery in Taiwan. The most exciting thing for children is we only allow playing fireworks in the Chinese New Year. We usually bought many fireworks from the grocery and played many fireworks with my cousins in a park near our home. Playing fireworks was very exciting you can experience the wonderful scene of fireworks. I also enjoyed the time playing with them because it's hard for us to meet each other in our daily life. I miss my childhood a lot. The Chinese New Year is coming soon. It's a pity that I can't get together with my family because I'm in the U. S. But I will call my family and sand my regards to them. I hope all of us can have a wonderful and perfect new year.
