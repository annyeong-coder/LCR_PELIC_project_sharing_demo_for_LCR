I studied in King ANON_NAME_0 school. I use to wake up at 6 00am. Usually I don't eat my breakfast I overheat my car and I go to my school. I use to reach to my school at 7am. My favorite class is math . I use to be ready to participate my class. After that I have a break for 30 minute. Actually we have a lot of great classes for example English classes and chemistry and Arabic classes. Sometimes I use to participate in sports classes. I finish my classes at 1 00pm and I come back home and set with my family and having lunch together. After that I use to study my subjects. SO I like my school and I wish that the old school day's come back.
