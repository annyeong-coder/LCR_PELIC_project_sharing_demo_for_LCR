Study It's not easy to learn something with foreign language I have to get good grades to transfer to CCAC 3. Money Students are consumer Now increasing exchange rate Conclusion Although these difficulty I'll get my goals here in Pittsburgh Living in U. S. As an international student is never easy. I arrived here Pittsburgh about 1 month ago. At first although I have learned English 10 years over I can't talk with native Americans. But that is just the beginning. I have never been alone before even in Korea. So doing everything is challenging for me. First all new circumstance was waiting for me. I had to make contract with an apartment manager. It's my first contract to get the house and with English. I can't understand some part of contract. And I'm living alone so I have to cook. I didn't cook as yet. So I stared learning to cook rice. In addition I couldn't talk with American to order food at restaurant or drink at caf In conclusion as I am here I have difficulties to live here. But I have a dream so I can overcome these problems. It has a value to fulfill a dream getting over the obstacles. I'll get my goals here in Pittsburgh beyond these difficulties.
