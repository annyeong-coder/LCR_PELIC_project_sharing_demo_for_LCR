My name is ANON_NAME_0. I came Pittsburgh last year I have been here for 8 months. I began to study English at the ELI at the end of August of last year but I have not yet spoken English fluently. I wanted to make more native friends to improve my English so I signed up for finding a conversation patner. Now I have a patner who is a senior of University of Pittsburgh. We have already met once at some Chinese restaurant then talked a lot abuout our hobbies and our family. Her talking interested me She has been living here since she entered this university also has been learning to take the photographs for a long time. She said to me that if I also like taking some pictures we could enjoy exchanging our pictures! I thought that was a very good way for keeping company with each other.
