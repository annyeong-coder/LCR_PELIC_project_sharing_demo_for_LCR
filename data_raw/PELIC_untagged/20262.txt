From my perspective men have had more weight than women in the construction of social order. Most nations have been founded on patriarchal societies it means men have established the rules and organized the power into the collectivity this point is relevant because it explains why historically men have kept the main positions in the economical and political ambit and women instead have concentrated their efforts in raising children and strengthen the family. If we look back thirty years it is evident that the leaders of countries were almost all of them men if we observe the different areas of knowledge we will also see that most of their representatives were men. Nowadays the situation is modifying both genders are equating their roles and we can find more women in powerful positions however the consequences of centuries of masculine order are still perceptible in our society.
