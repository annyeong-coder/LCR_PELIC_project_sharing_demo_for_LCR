One of my friend who used to drink too much called back my cell phone today morning because I was trying to reach his cell phone before this morning but he had not answered my call beside this he had hung up the phone. I thought about him he is upset because sth and I need to pick him up where he is. I had called him many times but he was just holding up me on the phone. He was not talking. And I was trying to keep him on the phone for find his location. At the end of the long struggle someone who were in the bar where he drunk I got the bar name and address. I dropped him off his house. And in this morning he found out person who dropped him off last night. That why he called.
