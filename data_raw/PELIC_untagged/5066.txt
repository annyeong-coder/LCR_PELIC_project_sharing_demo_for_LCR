I agree with her opinion of paragraph3 and 4. I am so called an old type man. So I don't like online dating itself. Because the communication with other people is not only exchange one's opinion but also observing partner's expression tone of his or her voice and behavior. Even if directly we met someone we took a long time to know his or her personality. We should take more time to know about partner's when we use on line dating. And we should not give our personal information before we know enough about our partner. I don't agree with her opinion of paragraph5. Certainly it is important to give a chance. But according to each circumstance there are some cases in which the first impression is more important. To prevent to be involved in the crime it needs to believe the impression.
