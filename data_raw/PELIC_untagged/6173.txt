Now I live in a rent apartment in Pittsburgh. The prior tenant had set up the environment and I didn't have to pick up the furniture. That really cheers me up because I just paid little money and then got a lot of necessary furniture. However a part of my room is sharing with other roommates and there is no shadow between my own room and the sharing part. I felt no personal privacy and that really brought me down. Later someone suggested me hanging up a curtain in the middle of the room. I tried this idea out and it was very helpful. I don't take away my roommates' right to use the sharing space but keep my privacy. I solved the big problem then I could enjoy my new life in Pittsburgh.
