I chose the topic which is the Look before you leap . Because I have some ideas about this topic. This idiom refers that you should think before you to do. I think people should not remove from their brain this idiom. I mean they should behave according to this idiom. I can support this idiom with one Turkish idiom similar that. Turkish people say Don't roll up your pant legs unless you see brook river . This phrasal is pretty appropriate for my idiom. This sentence intends don't judge or don't make comment about anything unless you see the context or situation. Actually I sometimes can be excited so I can behave and I can decide without thinking. But if I don't want to be upset after my decisions or behaviors I should behave with thinking. I should look before I leap!
