Working and studying part time In some countries like the United States for example some teenagers has the practice of working wile they are also still students. This occurs because they want to start getting money and feeling free to take some decisions about which kinds of thing they are going to buy or eat. In my country Brazil we do not have this kind of practice if the teenager goes to school he just have his studying and extra school duties. I do not like the idea of sharing time between going to school and working and the two main reasons that make me think that way are the teenagers has less time to think about really important things for there ages like studying and socializing and working makes them take more responsibility than is appropriated for there years. Teenagers are full of energy and can be easily distracted. In my opinion the most important thing that an adolescent should think of are studying practicing a sport and having free time to do whatever they like for example developing some king of hobby learning a new language or spending time socializing with friends. In the teenager years being somebody to the group is very important and this is part of their evolution. I do not see any place for a job in a teenager life unless they need to help their family with money. Having a job is a duty that requires a responsibility. There is always somebody counting on your work and needing you in any level when you have a job it can be your boss or some coworker. In my opinion is good to teach the adolescent that a grown up person have responsibilities but is always better to show this in other ways than working like for example in the school proposing some kind of group exercise or helping with home duties. In conclusion I think that working are for grown ups and children and teenagers should be focused in their own years duties like studying playing and socializing.
