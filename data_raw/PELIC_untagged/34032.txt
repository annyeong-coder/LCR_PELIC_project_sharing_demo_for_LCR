Many people may have the problems with money. There is no exception about me. I spent too much money last month. I bought a new laptop moved to a new house and tried a lot of different and expensive food. Therefore I realized that is a big problem when I had to pay my tuition last week. I shouldn't have spent too much money during one month. However I can get more money from another account but I couldn't do that anymore. Now I want to give some advice to the people like me. You should have a specific plan to spend your money. Moreover you outht to create a safe account which you might never use but you can use it when you have the troubles with money. In addition you should have some good friends who can help you when you get in trouble.
