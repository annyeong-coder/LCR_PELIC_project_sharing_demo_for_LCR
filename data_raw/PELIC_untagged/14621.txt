My future plans First of all I am going to register in the next level of English language in the ELI at University of Pittsburgh. Then I may go to Washington DC next month. I might not stay there more than two days. I must register in the GRE course. When I finish the next level of the English language in the ELI I will set the TOEFL test. If I get high scores both in GRE and TOEFL I might get an acceptance in a University. Then I will start study as soon as I complete the registration. I might not go home before two years because our Embassy will not give us the plane tickets to my country before that. After I finish my study I must go back to my country and I could restart teaching in my faculty. Also I might change my car after that.
