When I asked to write about the place where I grew up lots of nice things came to my mine and I started to remember them. Our neighbor who has a big house is sociable. He used to invite us to have a dinner which is usually a big meal called Zabiha. His son whose car is very popular in that time is so funny. We used to make a fun of him because he has a special character which is different from us. His little son whom I used to play with was playing soccer well. He was able to control the ball which was made of nature leather. I like this place where I grew up because there is a special emotional feeling which is coming from inside the heart. I grew up in a small village where you can find a verity of old building. This village having unbelievable natural views has a big impact in my character. For example I am serious almost the time and that attributed to the kind of environment where I used to live in. Many people who have lived in this environment like to the old houses. They remember their childhood and how the real taste of the life was. My old friend whose father has a big orchard is an honest friend. I never heard something wrong about him. He was admired and trustful friend. Finally these words which I am writing now don't describe the whole thing about my childhood because there are no words can describe the nice moments of your life.
