I agree with ANON_NAME_0. A useful generalization about other people become a harmful stereotype when people are from different groups. People use their experience to judge others who are from different groups as them this can lead to the bias and prejudice among different groups. People tend to have their own stereotype of thinking of how other people are. The difference can sometimes trigger people's mind the set a stereotype towards other people.
