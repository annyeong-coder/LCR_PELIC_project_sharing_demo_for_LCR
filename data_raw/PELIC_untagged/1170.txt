Majoring is the common problem that student faced when they finish high school. Sometimes student regret their choices and change more than once their specialties. Sometimes they complain I should have chosen literature instead of history and some student might say I must have learned another language that may help them to study abroad. Especially for non US citizens those always exaggerate the importance of learning English they think that learning this skill might have helped them study in U. S or other English speaking countries. In fact choosing a major could have been harder for me if I didn't have a plan. Every high school student should have done a list of his own that must have all his interest and he must have contacted an advisor to help him in this critical time . If he is done all this steps majoring will be less confusing. In order to success he should have done an ambitious plan and he must have taken this issue seriously. Then he will succeed
