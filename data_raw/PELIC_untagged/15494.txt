Brazil is a colorful country with its interesting carnival. Carnival is an important part of their life as a party. My friend said It started many years ago. Parents and their children dance on the streets together in Brazil. They eat food and spend very good times. At that nice entertainment oriented carnival they make more firm their relationship.
