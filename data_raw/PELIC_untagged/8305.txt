I agree that variety is the spice of life. I lived and studied in Taiwan. The most of people live in Taiwan who will go to college when they finished their high school. But I decided to learn English in America. Then I feel it is excised for me to have a different experience. Also I find that I am more mature than before. Moreover my English is better than before. Variety make my life more excited and interested. I would like to have a lot of variety in my life.
