Yerterday I was thinking about my life and then I felt unhappy about my English. If I had studied before I came to Pittsburgh I could have Known so much English now. Then I might have enjoyed more of all those years that I lived here in Pittsburgh and maybe I shouldn't have had some of the bad experiencies. Maybe I ought to have had more American people. But now I'm felling better because my English is getting better day after day.
