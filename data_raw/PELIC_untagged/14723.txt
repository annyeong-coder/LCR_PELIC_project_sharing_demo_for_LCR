I'm always nervous from the open water. My sister tried to encourage me to do it. After many tries I agreed. In the beginning I was so reluctant. She didn't let me swim by my self. She helped me swim in the ocean. She gave me some advices such as you have to breathe well. Also she had me practice her lesson under the water. She made me discover a new world. She got me to try the new activities. I did the snorkeling surfing and parasailing. Thanks my sister you gave me a new soul.
