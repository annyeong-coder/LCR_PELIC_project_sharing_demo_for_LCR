Some people can't afford to buy movies music or books off the internet. Therefore free downloading saves their money and expands their variation of leisure time. I understand that sometime free downloading gives both customers and industries benefits. For example we can enjoy new singer's songs for free and they can expand their name more easily than others. Although there are some advantages about free download this action might disturb a business cycle as well as bring down someone who earns money by legal and official downloads.
