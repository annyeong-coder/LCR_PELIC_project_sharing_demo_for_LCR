I had never taken treatment for all of my wisdom teeth by the time I came America. Since I moved here I had had a pain in one of them and it had been getting larger day by day. Finally I couldn't stand for the pain. I went to dentist. A dentist took X ray and he said that I need to remove them soon otherwise it would be factors in mouth trouble. While I was taking treatment I was sleeping because I had taken sedation shot before it began. When I wake up I was surprised that the doctor removed all of my wisdom teeth at once. I had had 4 holes in my mouth and my face had been swollen for while. He counseled me to avoid eating food for 2 weeks. Since 2 weeks later I have been eating regular food. As for pain new pain that appear after surgery was terrible. I had had the pain for a month. That dentist's process was initial experience for me. Because dentists have never removed all of wisdom teeth at once and no one have used sedation when they remove a tooth in Japan. That experience has become my principal memories of America. However using sedation is a great method. It helps us reduce stress of treatment. Whatever I hope that I will never go to dentist.
