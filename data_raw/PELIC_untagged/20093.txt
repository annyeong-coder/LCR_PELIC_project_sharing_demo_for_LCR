Today there are lots of social problems in my country Korea such as sexual discrimination regionalism population and etc. Among the social problems I want to focus on population problem in Korea. Korea face population problem which is decrease of population becoming aging society and concentration in urban area. Also those problems cause many effects. First of all to explain about the cause of population problem today in my country Korea population decreases than past. In past most people prefer boy than girl when they are pregnant. Therefore some people had abortion since the baby was not boy. Furthermore in 1980 government had a policy which reduces children because of economy. Also as increasing opportunity women to learn the woman who works are also increased. However since there are unfair treatments to pregnant women in their working place many women don't prefer having baby. Like above reasons population become decreasing and Korea faced serious problem. According to a research by UN Korea is becoming ageing society since in 2000 as population is decreased. This change of population affects economy aspect. First there are not enough people to have a charge of producing part. Also the people who are consumer are decreased. Then as the population which should depend on supporting increase financial state will be put hard. It can bring a shortage of labor and lose revitalization of economy. Furthermore population concentrates on urban area since most people prefer to live in urban area. This preference has some problems. One thing is traffic jam. As there is a serious traffic jam the time which people spend on the road is increased. This also influences the air pollution. Also there are no place all of people to live in urban area while rural area has extra space. As people move to city there are not people to agriculture in farm. In conclusion there is a population problem in my country Korea. This population have many results negatively.
