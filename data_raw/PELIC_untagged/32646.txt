2 I lived with my parents and my siblings who you have met. 5 My brother who I hardly ever saw slept on the living room coach. 6 It was a large old coach which my father had made himself. 7 My best friend whose family I loved lived across the hall. 11 They sold delicious bread and cake which people stood in line for hours to buy. 12 My brother and sister who I miss live far away now.
