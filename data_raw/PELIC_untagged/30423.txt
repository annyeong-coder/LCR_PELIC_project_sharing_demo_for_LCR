Should could ought to had better Dear SAND Thank you for trusting me and treating me as a close friend! In my opinion you could've asked him whether he loved you or not. You ought not to quit your job since you have't known what's going on with your boy friend. You had better make sure that he truly loves you and would like to be with you in the future then you decide if it is worthwhile for you to quit your job. You could visit him once a week if it is possible. But you should let him know in advance. Sincerely! Chatty
