My flow generated when I did my choreographic projects for my last showcase on stage in college. When getting to work I used to lock myself in the dance practice room with a giant mirror and imaged a story just happened right there. After searching the music suitable for my mind what I needed was a quiet and closed environment for letting the music absorb me and transport me. I took the time to analyze the music and think about which moves would fit with each section to express my own story. After squeezing hours of brain juices I started to respond to how the music felt at the moment through improvisational moves as a creative outlet. The whole process of making choreography was exciting simply because I cannot stop moving and thinking. However I always found my progress of that choreography was delayed when time flied because so many ideas developed on my mind at the same time. During that period of time I could dance on the road and even dreamt I was dancing in somewhere. Therefore I knew I sensed the inner flow while I was dancing and choreographing. Even now when I wrote down these words about my experience I can feel my soul dance somewhere continually in process.
