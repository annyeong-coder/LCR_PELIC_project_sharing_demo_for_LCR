Long time ago I wanted to book a flight ticket to come home. I picked up my phone and made a phone call to a travel agent. I asked for her help to figure out a best price for me and she said she will call back later. It was a holiday period at that time therefore when she called me back she said that she could only book a normal price ticket for me. I gave up looking for lower price ticket and accepted that one because I had a strong desire to come home then.
