Three month ago I went with my husband to Washington DC. My husband took part on a conference. While he was seating in the conference I was visiting some interesting places in Washington DC. For example I went to the White House and to the Spy Museum. One day I went to the Tysons Shopping Mall. I spent the whole day there. In the evenings my husband and I ate dinner together. This was our first time we discovered the restaurant The Cheesecake Factory . We spent one week in Washington DC so we had many different clothing with us. For instance my husband had to wear a suit. Moreover the weather was cold and wet. Finally we had a great time in Washington DC.
