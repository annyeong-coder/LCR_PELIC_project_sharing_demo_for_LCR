Three mouths ago I was thinking should I continue studying in ELI or not Fortunately I decided to stay and I think that was a correct decision. If I had not stayed I would not have had the chance to further consolidate my overall English ability. Grammar for instance I feel more comfortable to distinguish the subtle difference. If had not decided to stay I could not have built that kind of strong connection between small differences in my mind. In addition I started feeling the pressure of being a student at level five. It was much easier when I was a level four student in ELI however I began noticing some pressure such as memorizing lots of difficult vocabulary in reading class. I think the pain is caused by the process of making a big leap. Thus if I had not stayed I would never have had chance to be better.
