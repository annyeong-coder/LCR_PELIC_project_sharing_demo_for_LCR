Some people are probably more successful in their relationships. They have the qualities essential to loving relationship. However the lack of these qualities is probably the cause of many problems that we have with other people. Many of us would benefit from developing those qualities we don't have. For example many people get married and divorced over and over again and others don't get along with coworkers on the job. Therefore their lives would be easier if they were better at communication and more honest about their feelings.
