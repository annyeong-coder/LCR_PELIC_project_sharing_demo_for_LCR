The last month I was interested to buy an iphone. I called to the AT T customer service and I received information by an call center agent. The next day he called me back for the aplication and he insisted me to fill it out. I tried to figure out if I wanted that phone or perhaps an android. He told me in the website there are some information and I could find it out. My roomate called me at this moment and he held on in the line for a few seconds. Finally I thought back on my old phone and I realized that it was good. The agent got through with the call and I hung up the phone.
