When I pass the TOEFL exam I'll study here in the U. S. If I can graduate from PITT I'll proud of myself. Unless I study a great deal I may not speak correct English. In case my parents worry about me I'll go back to Taiwan as soon as the ELI has finished. Because Pittsburgh is a lively city it will be good to study for my graduate degree here at Pitt. After I make up my mind to study I'll do my best to achieve my goal. As soon as I finish my graduate degree I'll travel in the US from the east coast to west coast. Once I find my true lover I believe it will be a new chapter in my life. Before settling down I want to pass the TOEFL exam in the US. Although I feel homesick all the time to better my future I have decided to continue my higher education in the US.
