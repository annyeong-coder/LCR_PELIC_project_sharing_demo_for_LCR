Stereotypes of social groups invariably prove incomplete and biased. Walter Lippman There is a stereotype in Korea from long ago A man must not enter the kitchen. Our ancestors believed if a man entered the kitchen the man would not success in his life. It means a man concerned about housework and the man could not do great things for the societies or nation. In other words housework is a female part and outdoor work is a male part. There are male and female parts in Korea from long ago. Actually most of men who are forty years or older have not done work at home. However it proved incomplete and biased these days. A man who works housework and outdoor work well is on the increase. So far from working any failure at the outdoor work they do great work. For example a pastor who is my church in Korea often said his experiences. He has had many titles as a pastor a chief of churches and a director of college but he does not neglect his housework. He strongly recommends doing housework to his men's saints. He also does wash dishes and cleaning room. He knows there are not male and female parts. Next I know a person who is my brother in law is very busy for outdoor works. He is a university professor the manager of Duranno Father School and deacon and teacher at the church. Even though he is busy he does his best his housework. He often does wash dishes make a dish and cleaning room. Therefore the stereotype a man concerned about housework and the man could not do great things for the societies or nation proves incomplete and biased.
