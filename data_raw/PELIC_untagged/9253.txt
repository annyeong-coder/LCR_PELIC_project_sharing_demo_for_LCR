I have many friends most of whom love to see movies. I have seen a lot of movies several of wich were hits. One day I and some friends decided to go to the movies. We saw the film Pay it Forward wich is based on the book with the same name wroted by Catherine Ryan Hyde. The genre of the film is Drama. Mimi Lender who is the director of the film is a very good director. Kevin Spacey Helen Hunt and Haley Joel Osment all of whom are a very good actors are the main actors in this movie. This movie I s a story about a twelve year old boy who creates a proyect as a class proyect to change the world. His name is Trevor feature by Haley Joel Osment. He has the idea of paying a favor not back but forward. He chooses three people for whom he will do a favor and then when those people thank him for the favor and ask him how they can pay him back he explain them that they shuold pay it forward by choosing three people for whom they can do favors. With this ideas he change his life his mother life and his teacher life too. This is a story of how ordinary people made extraordinary changes by the simple faith of a child. Is a story of hope. I highly recomend this movie. I don't remember how many times I have seen it and every time it touches my heart deeply.
