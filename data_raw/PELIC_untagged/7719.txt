I have a small but pretty yard in front of the my house. Like most garden it is a square. When you enter yard through back gate there is a small pool in the middle of the yard. There are five old threes in the corner of the garden. The table is right side of the garden. There is a hammock between two trees. In addiction there is some little chair and tables in front of the back wall. There is a small area on the left side for kids to play. It is really funny to spent time in my garden especially afternoon. I think that every yard has different characteristic. As a conclusion having a yard is good and excited.
