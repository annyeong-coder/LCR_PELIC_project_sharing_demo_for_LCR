3 DAYS WEEKEND Usually the weekend is two days but this weekend is different because Monday was the Memorial Day so it is three days Sat Sun and Monday. On Saturday I started my day as usual with jogging then I called my friend Naeil to ask him if he needs help to fix his buggy car at 10 00 I was with him in his garage we started fixing the car it was in bad situation He hit a tread with the rear wheel so the suspension system broken it took seven hours to finish it after that I back home and I took relaxing shower and at 7 00 pm I went to Lenor's goodbye party He left to Russia He is a good guy I will miss him so much. Sunday was a long day at morning I called my brother in Turkey He was in a business trip there I talked with him about the design of his house which I am working on it these days at noon I went fishing with my friends We were unlucky We could not get any thing I think the fish was in a vacation too at night I went to LOWE'S theater with Naeil We watched Night at the museum 2 it was interesting but not as much as the part 1 then we walked home for 40 minutes. Monday was a working day My friend Rob asked me to help him paint his fence we started at 11 00 am at first I thought it will take two or three hours but it took the whole day I was tired at the end of the day my back was hurting me so much so it was terrible end for my long weekend.
