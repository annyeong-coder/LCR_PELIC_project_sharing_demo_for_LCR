Hi ANON_NAME_0 When you come to the USA I advise you to come to Pittsburgh because it's a very nice city and there are many universities here from which you can choose and you should bring heavy clothes because the weather in the USA is very cold in the winter and you'd better learn some words in English to help you when you come here and don't forget to bring with you a camera to take some pictures because the nature in the USA is very beautiful . About the studying you ought to learn English very well to pass TOFEL exam you should get high score to get acceptance from university and I advise you to take English course in the ELI English language institute in university of Pittsburgh because I am taking course now in the ELI and I benefit from it and another reason the teachers here are very friendly and competent . After that when you study your major in the university you should study hard and make great effort to get high scores you'd better study with group because that will help you much . Bear in mind to keep in touch with your family from time to time and don't forget them . Finally can you please bring me some Libyan spices because I didn't find them here . Best wishes .
