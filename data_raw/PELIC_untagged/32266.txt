The one quality is a strong sense of responsibility is the character quality that keeps you going even when you are tired and helps you to go the extra mile for the sake of your patients. It makes you do the right thing even if it involves sacrifice without ulterior motives even when no one else is looking. The second one is a physician who is kind compassionate humane considerate tolerant generous empathetic and sensitive. A physician who is genuinely interested in your well being and he is sensitive even to the unspoken needs of the patient. Third one the quality that ensures that the patient's rights autonomy modesty and privacy is respected at all times. Being a patient is difficult and many patients feel that they are vulnerable not just physically but also emotionally and psychologically. Being professional is not a quality that is innate and I think many do not realize that. Being professional at all times is difficult because we are only human and human nature with its needs weaknesses and desires do often run contrary to being professional. In summary being a good doctor should have different kind of qualities to become a good doctor.
