My room looks very fully and dark. However my room always makes me comfortable. I moved here last August. When I came here first I straightened up the furniture. I put up curtains with my host family and I decided to throw away many useless things such as candles fan and chairs. I touched up my room to make my own space like my room in Korea. After I came here I used to leave on my computer. Also I want to make up my new desk more clean and arranged. I have one bed that is in the back side of my clothes chest. I want to turn my bed around to other side because some times I can feel wind from the big window. One day last year it was really heavy rain with thunder and lightning. Suddenly our street's electric power was interrupted. Kevin and I try to find candles and light them up. We were scared because our dog started barking so we just stayed in my room and prayed that lights would turn on soon. This is just one situation about my room. Kevin and I are sometimes talking about tearing down our wall even though it is impossible. I'll try to change my wallpaper because I want to make my room to cheer me up.
