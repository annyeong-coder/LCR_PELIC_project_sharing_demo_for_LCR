Conversation between student and teacher ANON_NAME_0 Hello ANON_NAME_1 did you sign up for talk time activity. ANON_NAME_1 yeah ANON_NAME_0 hold on. Let me check your name. Ok here we go. So you should call me back to inform you the time of this activity ANON_NAME_1 sounds good. Excause me could you think over that I can't come during weekend because I have some duties. ANON_NAME_0 I think you can pick up appropriate time later. I don't think that you would end up with unappropriate time. ANON_NAME_1 could give me a favor. ANON_NAME_0 definitely ANON_NAME_1 well I was wondering if you'd mind talking into our director to give up doing other activities. ANON_NAME_0 Well I will try. I hope he wouldn't turn me down. ANON_NAME_1 One more thing before you hange the phone up. ANON_NAME_0 what's that ANON_NAME_1 I promise you to keep on doing the best as much as I can.
