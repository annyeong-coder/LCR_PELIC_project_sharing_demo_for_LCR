I went shopping for food this morning. There was a great deal of rain and a lot of traffic. When I got to the store I bought many things that I'm going to need for the next week. I'd like to cook this week a special recipe but it needs several ingredients. I need a few zucchini so I bought a dozen. I'm going to need a lot of flour to fry the vegetables. I don't like greasy food so I'm going to use just a little oil. I also bought a few personal things. I like this store because I can find a lot of things that I used to buy when I lived in Mexico.
