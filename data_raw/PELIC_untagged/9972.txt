Last year the biggest oil spill in South Korea's west coast occurred. The reason for the accident was an oil spill when the steel wire linking a tug boat to a barge carrying a crane snapped in seas. The oil spill has triggered an environmental tragedy. Unfortunately the spill was all over the west coast and it came in the neighborhood of this area Taean Yosu. But Yosu was the place to be held for an international event called Expo. Because bidding for the event South Korea insisted its slogan was 'the living ocean and coast'. But now South Korea's west coast is not clean any more. Also the theme of Yosu's Expo cannot maintain no longer fantastic slogans. Therefore it will be faced with the successful Expo opening and advertisements. From site of the spill area to drifted lower area the oil stuck showed up continuously and settled to the bottom. Even though masses of oil contamination were partly removed by soldiers and volunteers in my opinion it is difficult to restore the west scenic beaches and the maritime ecosystem in this region to its former condition. And this makes ripple effects to villagers. Some of the fishermen killed themselves or attempted suicide because they lost their living site and felt frustrated. It is not only a disaster but also a calamity. Even now there are so many people who want to extend a helping hand to the villagers in Taean. Movement of cleanup has kept on doing for the maritime organisms' survival and the local residents who were struggling to resist many kinds of serious damages in the area of oil spill. I hope the effects of many natural disasters may be minimized with proper planning.
