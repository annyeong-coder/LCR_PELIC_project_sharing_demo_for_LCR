Hi I am ANON_NAME_0 Last Name . I have been building this site for two months. I've written this page to introduce myself. I am from Japan. Also I grew up in Nagoya Japan. But now I have been living in Pittsburgh for about 15 months. Because I got engaged to my boyfriend. He came in here two years ago. I just followed along. I met him nine years ago so I have been having a relationship with him for eight years. We discovered a mutual interest in golf. We've practiced our golf swing. We get along extremely well. For example He likes long hair style. Also now I am thinking of changing my hair style. I have kept my hair shorter but now I let it grow longer. It is shoulder length now. We haven't set a date to marriage.
