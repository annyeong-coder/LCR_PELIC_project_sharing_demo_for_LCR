I met a very nice friend Natalie when I was studing at high school. She's been my roommate for 2 years. She always thoughtful and kind to me. We know there is no secret between us. My mom also likes her she told me if Natalie could be my sister that will be wonderful! Even though I'm in the U. S. A now sometimes we still can find the same time to talk. I remember when I decided to study abroad. She was sad and we cried together. But she knew that is a rare opportunity and whole new challenge for me. So she chose to bless me and gave me confidence. And we just talking on phone 20 mins ago!!
