Even though my first major is biology I decided to become a dentist for my future. After I got a master degree in the field of microbiology I worked and researched in the laboratory of Medicine Company. But routine works in the lab made me think again about my goal. So instead of becoming a biologist I made a difficult decision to be a dentist. In spite of the difficult situation my family encourages me to persist in studying. While most my friends enjoy their lives the fact that I am still studying make me depress. However whenever I feel depressed I always try to instill self confidence that I can do. Although it is very hard for me to study in the ELI and to prepare examination at the same time I believe that I can manage to do it. For sure after I finish my examination on December I believe that I will receive a good score to apply the school. If so I can bring my wife and daughter here and my dream will come true. After three or four years from now on I will open my own clinic. One more thing if I have a chance I would like to participate in a project such as the study of bacteria that cause dental caries which is related to my first major microbiology. This activity will give me a good motive in that this research will upgrade and build up my carrier.
