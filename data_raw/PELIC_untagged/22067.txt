Most Korean think that New Yearis a really important holy day. The New Year's day is on January first of every year by solar calendar and we have another New Year's day by lunar calendar that is in February. So we have to prepare two times to celebrate the New Year. The New Year's day is pretty big and important to keep traditional custom. Therefore at first we need to prepare food and clothes for New Year and then we do activitys. Finally We celebrate together. First Usually we need to go shopping to prepare food that is traditional food before we begin. After that my mother cook traditional food that is Bulgogi Korean rice cake etc. While mother cook traditional foods we wear the traditional clothes that is HanBok. When we wear a HanBok we should help to cook with mother. Before we meet relatives we must finish everythings for New Year's day if we meet them in my house. It depends on where we will meet relatives. Second Actually most korean want to go hometown that is far from their city to meet their family or relatives. So they move to eto activity. Our holy day is free except my mother who should cook. All process is controled to do everything.
