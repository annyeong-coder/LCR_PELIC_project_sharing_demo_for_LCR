My Office My office room in my house is very neat and comfortable. The office usually cheers me up if I stay in and keeps my offer up. From time to time I try to fix it up. For example I brought a board and hung it up to write a new English word on it. Also I bought a new lamp to light my desk up. Some time I prefer to sit down on the ground if I get back from the school so I try to keep the ground clean all the time. In fact I don't have enough shelves to but my books back. With just a few small changes I will end up feeling happier in my office. It's worth trying on.
