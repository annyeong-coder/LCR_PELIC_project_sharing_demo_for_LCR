Dear Xavi In my opinion to choose Pittsburgh as a living place is the best alternative. Despite its weather when people come here they never want to go because pittsburgh has many things that make it a great place. Principally people are really friendly so you always are going to feel like home. Also the city has an awesome landscape. By the other hand despite not be the bigest city it has many amazing places where you could go like parks museums etcetera. Thus you never will feel bored. I believe that all these aspects make Pittsburgh so nice. I think that teachers and classmates from ELI Pitt are unique. Finally I recommend that you should think carefully and compare both places. I just want to take you into make the best desicion. For my Pittsburgh it is really wonderful and I am sure that if you come here you are going to love this place as well.
