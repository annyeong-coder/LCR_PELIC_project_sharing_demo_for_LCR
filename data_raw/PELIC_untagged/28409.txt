Advertisement for my soul mate I'm scouting out my soul mate who can play table tennis well. I'd like to play table tennis at least three hours a day and once a week so my soul mate should be someone who is not very busy. I hope this person likes to watch professional sports and have favorite teams which are almost the same as me. He must be a person who likes children. And he'd better have children who are about two to four years old because they could become friends of my older daughter whose age is three. I hope he has good characteristics which are gentle easygoing and reliable. My soul mate is someone whom I can consult when my wife and I fight together. I want my soul mate whose age is not very different to me. I hope he lives in a place where is not very far from me. I'm sorry I made selfish demands which include many aspects. I think there are no person who totally correspond to these requests.
