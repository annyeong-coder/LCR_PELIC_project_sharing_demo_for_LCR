Global warming is the world issue. Every country tries to reduce the pollution to save the environment we have left and to rebuild forests we had destroyed. Why we have global warming It's all because we tried to find the best way for us to live. We created many things that can help us in our life make it more easily to live. But somehow we never think about we might pollute our land or air or water. Recently we noticed this problem. We figured out how to protect the planet we live and made it a better place for our children to live. If we didn't find the solution and continue polluting the world our children's children may have to live on other planet.
