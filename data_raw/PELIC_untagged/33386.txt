I had an interesting experience that surprised me . When I was in a university I had been coming late every morning . In one class I had taken the teacher was changed . An other teacher was serious about the attendance so I came late as usual . When I came the teacher told me to go out from the class after I had set at a chair . I asked him why to go out his answer was I came late so after that I have never come to class late .
