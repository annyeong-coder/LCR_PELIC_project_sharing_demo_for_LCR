I had an interesting experience in kayaking. I had never kayak before it was my first time. I had been standing in the line with my teacher ANON_NAME_0 I was very nervous. The kayak looks light and thin and the possibility to fall in the water is high. When the man called us to get in the kayak the adrenaline hormone level increased double. As soon as I got in the kayak I felt pretty good. By the time after we had stayed ten mints in the water we had learned how to paddled our kayak in a safe way and the most important point was how to did the break which helped us the most with Motaz and Thi because they are such a crazy drivers. By the time it ended I felt more confident and I would like to do it again but it was very sunny which I can't tolerated it. It was one of the most prominent memories that I had.
