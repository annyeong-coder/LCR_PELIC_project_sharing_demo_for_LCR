When I was teenager I always went to the beach. I took with me a tenet and a hook. I often caught some fish. Yet on one day I could not catch any one. Therefore I went further in the beach. I saw a strange fish. Before I attacked it there was an old man warned me from it. Then he said It is a sea snake and it has poison . After that I have paid attention to the same kind of fish or see snake. Finally I killed it with a spear and threw it away.
