Gi Mun Ban is now regarded the most famous person in Korea. He was elected as the Genernal Secretary of UN last year. This has been considered one of the most important achivement in the history of International Politics of Korea. It is said that Ban is doing his job well. It is also believed that he will make one of the most successful Secretary in UN's history. However sometimes it is felt that he has some difficulties in working there with many people from different countries. I hope that it will be proved that he is the just right person for the job for the world peace sometime in the furture.
