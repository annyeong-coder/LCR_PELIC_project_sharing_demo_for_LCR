Dear students Welcome to ELI. I have already studied here for 3 months. It is a good English school and the teachers here are very good too. The only thing which you have to do is study hard. You need go to class and hand in your homework on time. When you have some problems the teachers will help you. They are all very patient. If you want to improve your English quickly you should study in ELI. Sincerely ANON_NAME_0
