1. When the December comes I'll be 30 years old. !! 2. I might have a chance to get a job in the U. S if I acquire fluent English skill. 3. Unless I buy a warm and thick winter coat I must be frozen in Pittsburgh. 4. I'm going to store some emergency food at home in case I can't go grocery shopping because of heavy snow in winter. 5. I am going to New York in March because my mother and aunt are visiting there. 6. After finishing this semester I'm planning to take the TOFLE test to assess my English level. 7. As soon as the semester ends I would like to make a vacation plan to travel to the West area which is called The Grand Circle. 8. Once something becomes as a daily routines it feels strange not to do it so that I'm trying to listen the CNN student news every day in order to be my daily routines. 9. Before meeting my mother in March I have to buy a Pitt sweat suit at the vendor across from the Cathedral of Learning because she really looks forward to get it as a souvenir. 10. I will try my best the following one year here although it seems difficult to get a job here.
