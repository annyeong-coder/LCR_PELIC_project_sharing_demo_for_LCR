Nowadays obesity is increasingly becoming a major problem in all over the world even in developing countries. Obesity means a physical condition that a person has heavy weight and too much fat on the person's body which severely affects human health such as diabetes or heart attack. There are three main causes which are unhealthy eating habit less exercise and stress. According to a research the most commonly eaten vegetable among children is potato in the U. S. It indicates that most children intake carbohydrate which will work as sugar in their body from vegetable instead of fiber or vitamin which contributes their health. This unhealthy eating habit is related to their parents whose knowledge of nutrition is not enough. Less knowledge of nutrition causes unhealthy eating habit and eventually it causes obesity. In addition another reason of obesity is that people tend to not exercise. Consuming energy which they had is an important factor to keep their body healthy however the more our lifestyle become modern the less exercise. People always use transportation such as cars or buses instead of walking. It necessarily reduces opportunities to digest calorie which avoid being obesity. Finally the most invisible reason is stress. If people constantly expose strong stress they would get uncontrollable appetite. Furthermore appearance of fat itself might be stress for fat people. This vicious circle makes difficulty to overcome obesity. In conclusion it is unlikely to cause obesity only one cause. In other word unhealthy eating habit less exercise and stress obesity is caused by these three complex causes.
