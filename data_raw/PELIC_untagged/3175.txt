I have a large family. I have 3 maternal uncle and one aunt. My uncle WHO IS YOUNGEST has very close age to me. So he is like my friends. My aunt WHO HAS 2 BOY is physic teacher. My other uncles are also teacher. The oldest one who is 2 year younger than my mom is a mathematics teacher. Each of them have at least 2 children. So when we come together it is a great fun for me. My father have 2 brother an 2 sister. His sister who is younger than my father died. But the other one still alive. My uncle WHO LIVE AT VILLAGE is also language teacher. I have 2 sister and one brother. So our family very crowded. But I like having a huge family.
