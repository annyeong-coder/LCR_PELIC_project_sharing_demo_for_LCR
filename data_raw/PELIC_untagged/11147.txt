We are going to visit there 3 days from March 11 to March13 and we will go there by plane. Rob is one of my teachers he prepares all of the perfect schedule. The first day we are going to visit the John Hancock Building it's the third tall of building of world. Then we are going to go to the Shedd Aquarium Field Museum of Natural History and Grant Park seeing some difference of local culture and building and we will have a delicious dinner in Navy Pier. Second day we are going to go shopping on The Magnificent Mile or at 10 am Grayline Slightseeing Tour after finish breakfast. And then we are going to visit Garfield Park Conservatory that it will have a Age of Azaleas Spring Flower Show I think I will feel very exciting.
