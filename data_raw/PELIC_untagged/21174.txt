Simferopol where I grew up is a small city of Ukrain. I remember our apartment had two rooms where we live until 1984. This year when my parents decided to emigrate to Israel changed our life end to end. My big sister who closest to me received the news about the transition total shock. Our childhood friends those with whom we grew up don't belived. Our apartment where we playing and we gathered for parties strangers caught. After school I always ordered friends to eat lunch which my mother left me and my sister. The home work that we do'nt understand my syster did with us. My girlfriend's grandmother whom I treated like my brought us candy. My childhood which I remember until 1984 is very special for me until today!!!
