P. 48 4. Over the next 10 years do you think the use of major language other than English will increase or decrease on the World Wide Web Support your position orally or in writing by presenting reasons and examples. In today's world English has been a universal language for many decades. People all over the world speak English because it is used in many areas in life. Business schools or even governments are just some examples that use English. However the world is always changing. English will still be used very universally in the next 10 years but I believe another language that will become more and more important on the World Wide Web over the next 10 years is Chinese. It is very obvious that more and more people are investing in China. Many companies are opening factories in China because it is cheaper to make everything there. Almost all companies have websites in English right now but more and more of the websites also have Chinese versions. Also the population of China is increasing everyday so actually 1 4 of all the people in the world now speak Chinese. If this keeps going most people will be able to speak Chinese in the next 10 years. This will be very interesting for me because I will be one of the people who can speak both Chinese and English in the world.
