McDonalds and Red Lobster All of us need food to survive and to keep going. We need food because we need energy to keep our bodies warm especially in the winter. So we have to evaluate our food from time to time to know if we are spending our money in good or bad thing for our health. If we want to cook in our private kitchens in our homes we have to know what we are doing. Because that food will be for us or for someone we love. But sometime the hard life forces us to choose restaurants to get food easy and fast choice. In that time we have to evaluate the restaurants that we go to. McDonalds and Red Lobster are two restaurants that I used to be one of their fans. But now McDonalds dose not exist in my list no more. And that wasn't without reason there is reason and this is what I will write about. First we will take a lock at their menus how much does the normal meal for normal person cost In McDonalds it costs from 4 to 6 dollars it is cheap. But in Red Lobster the price is higher than the price in McDonalds. In contrast if I want to enjoy the delicious life lobster that will cost me around 20 dollars to get some phosphors. Then I will move to how comfortable both of them are. There are comfortable seats in both of them. But in Red Lobster the seats are nicer especially if you set on the bar. Finally we have to mention that there is no compare between them in the health side. Specifically in the total of Protein and phosphors or vitamins what I meant they call it nutrition facts and in the same time it is the thing that we usually don't lock at in that kind of restaurants. If I am rich I can eat healthy food every day but what if I am poor does it mean that I don't have another choice but fast food restaurants. I hope that there will be no hunger in all over the world and I wish that all the people can get healthy food whenever and wherever.
