We have to take Knifes with us. It is because with knife we can protect ourselves and cut things down. The second thing we should take is matches. With matches we can set up a fire to cook and try to make an attention. Ths third thing is chocolate. Chocolate is just in case that we can not find food to eat. The last thing is boat! It is extremely important because we can not leave without boat.
