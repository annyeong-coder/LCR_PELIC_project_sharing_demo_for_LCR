The concept of the ideal parent is different from culture to culture . Ideal family is a family who lives in Harmony without any conflicts or quarrels. Every member that lives in the family should cooperate with the others to make the life convenient. The father who spouse to work hard is trying to afford a good life for his children. The mother who spouse to stay at home is trying to raise up them. The parents whose children feel their love and their sacrifice are the best in my perspective. We always compare between the house where we were raised up and the house in which we raise our children. We can take the advantages to apply and the disadvantages to avoid them.
