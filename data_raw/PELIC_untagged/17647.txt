One of the memorable memories in my life is that when I first came to the states. I was only 9 that time and did't know a word of english which was why I was like a deaf and mute person when I was at school. In my class there was no chinese students so no one could speak with me but the girl sit behind me was really kind and we made it to communicate using gestures and expressions. Thank goodness that after 2 week's studying in the esl which was a office designed for international students in the school to learn english I was able to speak with others. I would never forget that period. It was a period of life that I first came up with difficulties.
