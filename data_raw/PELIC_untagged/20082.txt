The personality category that fit me most closely is optimist. First the optimist is an attitude which people treat anything very positively. People's life has a lot of trials and hardship growing up us. If you never meet any problem which is in your life is a sad thing. For example I'm an emotional people who are very anxious and nervous because I fear any failure including the test which is fail or doubting my future. However I tell myself you must cheer up when you meet any challenge. So this personality category is not inherent it was developed by many trouble. Indeed this manner which has the optimistic mood can help us face any challenge in your life. Now I know successful people always try to find the way to overcome his trouble and failure people who complain with God always find the excuse to comfort themself.
