I agree with ANON_NAME_0. Stereotypes aren't totally incorrect because those are based on each country's culture. The stereotyped ideas sometimes sound funny and odd but those are also good triggers to have interest in other countries or truth. For example before coming to America I thought that all Americans are fashionable but that is not true unfortunately. The wrong image came from magazines and movies. It is a kind of breathtaking thing to notice that my stereotypes are correct or not. However people having certain authority such as police or judges shouldn't have bias thought. They need to see people individually to make right judgments. Anyway having stereotypes isn't too bad to contact other people unless I enjoy those in private.
