Women are better parents than men. Women are usually better parent because of their nature. Pregnancy and kindness are the most important factors that are make the women are better parents. Mother carries the baby for 9 months in her uterus and then she delivers him with the most severe pain that can human experienced. I don't think the men can handle this experience. Kindness of the woman helps her to be a good parent. This kindness makes her is near from children more than father. I see in my daily live how children love their mothers more than their fathers. So it is obvious that the women are better parents than men.
