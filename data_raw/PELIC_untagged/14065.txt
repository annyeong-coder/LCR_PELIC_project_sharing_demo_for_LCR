Four years ago I started to learn computer language. I was very interested so I studied hard. Then I started to make a simple computer game. As I love computer game and computer language was so interesting I worked a lot. I couldn't recognize how much time passed I just focused on them. At the same time I got a lot of brilliant idea.
