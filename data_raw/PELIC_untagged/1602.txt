In these days many people consider studying cultures which is usually based on the long time history of countries. Two interesting cultures are the American culture and the Arabic culture. Thus University of Pittsburgh has designed two rooms which represent these two cultures. The first room is the Early American room which represents the culture and the life style of early Americans or the English settlers in the 17th century. On the other hand the second room is the Syria Lebanon room which represents the life style of Damascus' rich citizens. Each of these two rooms represents the life style of these two cultures based on their skills and needs religion and cultural issues. First of all if you visit the Syria Lebanon room you might shock because of its decoration and luxuries. These people cared a lot about luxury and beauty which might make us think that these people lived in a period of time when the decorative art were superior. For instance if you look at the ceiling you will see an amazing decoration painting which is a style of gesso painting which was made of a fusion of chalk and glue by a special method. In contrast if you visit the Early American room you will not see any decoration but you will see an interesting room design that it is a kitchen living room. Comparing with Damascus people these people did not care about art. However the seems to be having high engineering techniques.
