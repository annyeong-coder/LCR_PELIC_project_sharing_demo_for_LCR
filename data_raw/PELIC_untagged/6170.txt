Title New Legislation would protect sexual orientation. Author ANON_NAME_0 McNally The PittNews June 20 2007 Pensylvania discussed a law against sexual discrimination which was proposed by Dan Frankel representative of Pensylvania's Human Relations Act. This law would offer protection to gay lesbian and transgender citizens in order to avoid limitations to find a job house and have a free social life. In addition this law would recognize to people with diverse life styles and would do that Pensylvania and Pittsburgh will be more attractive to those graduated who wish to find a job with legal protection and without social marginalization due to their sexual condition. Therefore Frankel thinks that the law will approve and will be very helpful for these people.
