Do you like to think Have you ever written down about your ideas. Writing comes from your feelings or your mind. That is your inspiration originally from everyone or everything. The article is from a book which Seeds of Hope A Henri Nouwen Reader is written by Henri Nouwen. The article reveals three points writing represents your emotion connecting with your life and developing your imagination. First of the author's opinion he thinks that writing is little more than recording a pre existent thought. You don't say anything if the words can say them. Writing can describe your feeling that you couldn't say. Sometimes the words imply your real affection. For instance Ernest Hemingway who is a popular writer used brief words to describe his experience that he wanted to say. In addition the author said writing is a process in which we discover what lives in us it indicates that an ordinary event also is a subject matter in everywhere. It is plenty of your life. In your life everything fills us with the abilities. For example Mark Twain whose articles are humorous production described his stories when he was child. Finally for Nouwen writing is to open up new places within us of which we were not aware before we started to write. When you think the thing exists only in your mind or imagination For instance creating your imagination when you see everything. J. K Rowling fabricated a story to show her imagination. In conclusion showing your real feeling making your life richer and increasing your imagination are written by Henri Nouwen. In my opinion the context of writing is better than the number of words. You have to plan or think your writing logically. It is able to narrate your writing to be vivid and vigorous.
