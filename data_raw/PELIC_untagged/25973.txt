Children begin to try to impress their opposite sex when they are into adolescence. During this period boys and girls are easy to distract their mind from their study. Should boys and girls be educated separately since middle school Will the same sex schooling create a more relaxed social atmosphere and prevent boys from dominating classroom discussions and activities Absolutely not for the same sex schools the students may be free from distraction of the other sex however the same sex schooling would harm the socializing skill of its students. Unlike the co educational school which keeps gender diversity in school the single sex school makes the students unable to meet the people of different gender and thereby decrease the ability to communicate with the people of opposite gender might not know about how to talk with the people of the other gender for a long time even after graduated. Moreover the students from single sex school may have trouble to get friends of opposite sex which not only limited their broad view of the world but also their future such as marriage. Due to reasons above I am bias against the single sex schooling.
