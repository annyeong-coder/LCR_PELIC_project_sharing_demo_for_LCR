Sweet Basil is my favorite restaurant. It is in Bangkok in Thailand. It is a fusion Vietnamese restaurant. There are many kinds of cuisine. There are some kinds of roll such as fresh roll or grill roll. There are some kinds of the Vietnamese noodle. My favorite cuisine is pork ball with sweet souse. It makes from some pieces of ground pork mixing with onion pepper sugar and some of vegetables. I like it because its taste. I think that it is not a real Vietnamese cuisine. Cook may be makes it in a different style fusion style . This restaurant is not expensive. I went to that restaurant very often about once a week. My families also like this restaurant. That is why I like Sweet Basil restaurant.
