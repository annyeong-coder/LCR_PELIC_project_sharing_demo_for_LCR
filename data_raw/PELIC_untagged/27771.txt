It happened frequently. After lunch when I was taking a rest my cell phone rang and waked me up. That was not an alarm clock but a telemarketing call. They wanted to sell a health insurance or an accident insurance. Most of time I tried to hung up immediately but I gave up finally. This is a hard work because there are few people will hold on the phone after they pick it up. Although telemarketers attempted to talk me into taking out insurance I always responded gently and asked them to give me more time to think it over. Sometimes I requested them to send the detail to me because I can't figure out all the information about the contract in a moment. However I never called them back so they kept on calling my phone on another day.
