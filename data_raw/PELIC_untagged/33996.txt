Home is where one starts from. I think this means that home in which you live and where you learn most facts of life with your family. From my perspective my home where I have lived with my parents and my sisters who I have lived with happy life is one of factors which assist me to establish appropriate ways of my life and my future too. For example my parents whom I have learned from how I can behave with other people helped me to start my life consciously. My home is the only place where I grew up among my family. Moreover I have finished all my study levels in my home so I consider this place is the main point to each person where he can start his life correctly. In fact home is the place in which you feel happy and comfortable.
