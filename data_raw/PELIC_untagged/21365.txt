This term I have done a lot . First of all I have started to launch a social life for myself here. I made new friends which compensates me for being away from my family and friends . I consider meeting those good friends my big achievement. They do their best to support me in my new life. I attribute to them my successful in adapting to life here. Even if I have known them for few months I trust them and I feel comfrtable to confide to them my problems and secrests.
