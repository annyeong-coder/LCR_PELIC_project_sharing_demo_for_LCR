One of my American friends told me my son is a handsome boy. I am too happy about such praising. He is a medium height and average weight. His hair is really dark hard and thick. His eye is really clear. Especially when he is pleased there are a couple of dimples on his face. He likes a lot of sports. Swimming is the fondest game for him so that he has a strong healthy body. He likes blue so he has a lot of blue clothing. I always find out him in the great peoples easily. Not only my son is a handsome boy but also he is an ambitious and gentle boy. He hopes he can go to the best university of America in the future. His biggest achievement is that he became the first chair of the clarinet in his school band this year. Do you know he learned the instrument just three months He really loves reading. When he was a baby he could give first clear word was nian it means Reading. He loves the movies especially about the movies of romanticism and individualism. He really loves travels too. He has traveled many places pretty places and poor places in China. When he was 11 years old he rode his bike and finished a long way about 450 miles travel. His body and mind were really tested. To read thousands of book to walk thousand of road it is a famous words in China. I believe that my son can achieve his goal.
