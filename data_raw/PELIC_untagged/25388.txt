My outside listening was abou the Golden Gate Bridg in San Francisco. The bridg built for using car instead of ship for the transportion between San Francisco and the other side of it. Jossif is a person who made the idea of the bridg. Many people said that the bridg won't be completed because there were a lot of challenging which can make it more complicated. But Jossif choose not to listen to them. In 1919 they start to discuss about it they found that will cost them 250 million dollars. In 1921 they start to build the bridge while they were working there were many callenges face them. The first challenge was bears. Then the constraction was challenging for them. Finally the wind and the storm which destroyed the bridge. In 1935 they finshed from the building then they start to build the cable. After the choose the color which is orange. They started to prepare for the last touches such as the side and bick walk in 1936. In May 1936 was the opening day for the bridge. At the end there were just a few injured and ten dead people from the beginning.
