My favorite kind of music is classical music. First I like piano solo the best. It has a simple sound. Second I like symphony too. I am fond of music by Beethoven and Mozart. Before I had a chance to visit Beethoven's house in Bonn and to walk Beethoven's path in Vienna where he composed Symphony No. 6 Pastorale . Then I fell in love with his symphony. I went to a concert of Beethoven's ninth symphony with my husband every year he likes Beethoven the best. As a result I always listen to Beethoven's symphony in my house.
