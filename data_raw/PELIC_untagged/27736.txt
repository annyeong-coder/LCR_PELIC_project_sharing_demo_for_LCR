My home I feel happy about my home. It is big and new b but I should change the decor. I will hang up some posters and some photographs. I should move the sofa and the TV table around. It will creat more space in the living room. I should throw away the old bed. I will go to Target to pick up new curtains and I'll mountn them up in my bed room. I should figure out where should I put my new TV in the living room. It will be a long process but I will not give up and I will keep on till the end. At last my home will will cheer me up more. After I finishem my house makeover.
