When I told my husband I wanted to study English in the US he said that he could support me. Furthermore when I told him I wanted to go to graduate school in the US he said that he would support me too. But when I told same thing to my mother she was worried about many things. She asked me if I thought I could live there without my husband. She asked me when I graduate from school how old I am . Also she asked me if I had ever thought about having a baby. She said that I could study in Korea. She was right. She is always right. First thing first! My husband told me that I could study post doctorate course if I wanted to. I told him that I might study post doc course about age of 40.
