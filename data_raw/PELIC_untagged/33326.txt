From my perspective I think life at The Villages is comfortable and exciting for three following reasons. First people who live in The Villages are very friendly. For example ANON_NAME_0 greets me with a relaxed smile and a friendly hug and insist on buying me a much welcomed cup of iced coffee. Also ANON_NAME_0 tells the writer that Everyone's so friendly because everyone is so happy . Second people call the Villages Disney for adults because after they have been here for five years they are still pinching themselves and enjoying the permanent vacation. In addition The Villages has very convenient public facilities such as assisted care facility large Catholic church Starbucks central square and so on. People who live here can enjoy a colorful and wonderful life. According to these reasons I would like to live in a similar community when I a senior citizen. Life is always full of joys and sorrows so people deserve some relaxed and peaceful moments after they working hard.
