MY TRIP TO THAILAND Five years ago I went to Thailand with my friend. We spent three weeks there. I was on a good vacation. I had one month so we visited several cities. In the beginning we went to Phuket there the beautiful beach and diving trip then we visited Pattaya There are events in the street. Some Islands close to it so we have gone through and we took some pictures. After that we visited Bangkok. This is a big city and very crowded but the City is suitable for shopping because cheaper. Finaly we back home Loaded with gifts and beautiful anniversary.
