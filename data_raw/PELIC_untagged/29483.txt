I have been living in Pittsburgh for 1 month. I have never been to Pittsburgh before. There is nobody I had known before I came here. So the first important thing for me is to get along with all my news friends. I have been attending the activities in ELI and met a lot of new friends. I have visited the Carniege Museum. I have been to the Phipps. Also under the friends' help I have facilitated the bus. I have went to church for 3 times. At the church I met a lot of new Chinese friends who had been in Pittsburgh for many years. It was not as hard as I had thought before I came.
