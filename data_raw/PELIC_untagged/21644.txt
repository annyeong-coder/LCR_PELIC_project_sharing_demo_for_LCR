You can also find a budget from naming your own price. However it may be hard to find a low priced hotel in a major city like in New York. Therefore you can look for someone who sublets his apartment for a period of time. It is believed that you will save money when you get a sublet from others. Although living in a sublet is cheaper than a hotel it is not as comfortable as living in a hotel. Finally the transportation is thought to be another key factor. Most major cities have public transportation such as buses trains or subways. It is an efficient way to save money when you travel on public transportation.
