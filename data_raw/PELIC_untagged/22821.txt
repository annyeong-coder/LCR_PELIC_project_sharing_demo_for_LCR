I don't like my room when I it's dirty I like to straighten it up. So I usually clean it up. Before I enter the room I take off my shoes. I like to turn on the TV when I clean the room. I throw out the trash and hang up my clothes. I keep up cleaning my room because I want to do it in less time. Also I like to go to mall and pick out a new sheet every two months. In addition I like to put some pictures in the wall. I always set down on the chair and do my home work. Finally I turn off the TV before I go to bed.
