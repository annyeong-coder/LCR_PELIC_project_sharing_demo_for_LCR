The greastest different between Amercian culture and Chinese culture in my opinion is in some situations Amercian are more explicit while Chinese are a little implicit. American tend to express directly whereas that's sometimes a little impolite for Chinese. 1 When American want to ask others do somethings for them they always ask directly which is a little impolite for Chinese. 2 American like show their emotions more while Chinese don't like this way. 3 American don't need avoid showing their advantages while Chinese tend to do that.
