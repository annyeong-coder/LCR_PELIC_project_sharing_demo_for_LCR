Before I came to the USA I had never eaten pork and I had never drunk alcohol because they are forbidden in Islamic countries. As there isn't any hockey team in my city I had never watched hockey before I went to Canada. Also before I moved to the USA I had never been wearing shorts in the streets because in my hometown we can only wear shorts on the beaches not in the streets. Furthermore gambling is an illegal action in my country so there are no casinos over there therefore before I visited the USA I had never gambled in casinos. Moreover we don't have any subways in my city so I had never ridden a subway until I came here.
