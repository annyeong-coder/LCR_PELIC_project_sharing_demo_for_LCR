My favorite legend in my culture is one person called Dalboh. He is considered to be the model of most my life issues. He was born in 1900 and he was living in my city. Actually I considered this person a myth because the heroic stories he did through his life. One of his unbelievable stories when he was 30 years old there was a famine happened in his village at that time and a lot of people were killed. He was the richest person at that time and he had had a big sheep farm which was distributed for all the rest people to be alive. The noble scene in this story is the altruism and the sacrifice by all the properties that he had.
