These days we always buy things with our money. We buy TV refrigerators and furniture. The other side DIY phenomenon remains fashion among some people. This saying implies making it ourselves might be better than buying it if we know how to make. There are many things that we can make by ourselves. A bookcase is one of them. There are ten steps involved in making a bookcase. First of all we must prepare materials to make a bookcase. Materials are wood nails glue a hammer a saw sandpaper and paint. You can easily acquire the materials at a hardware store. Second you have to cut wood six pieces and two molding strips. The size of two side pieces is eleven and five eight inch by twenty eight inch the size of three pieces for the top the bottom and the shelf is eleven and five eight inch by thirteen and one second inch the size of one back piece is fifteen inch by twenty eight inch and the size of two molding strips is ten inch. You are careful to cut wood to get an identical bookcase. Next you should sand each piece of wood. Now that you have finished preparing you should keep going making a bookcase. Above all you have to glue one molding strip to each side piece at fourteen inch down from the top. After that nail two side pieces to piece of bottom with hammer and nails. You should watch to nail or it would cause a lethal wound. Also nail the top in place on the body made before as same way. In addition you should nail the back piece to the body. It is the most important work to be careful because a bookcase must be rigid to sustain weight of books. Ever since you have finished assembling a bookcase paint the bookcase and shelf with brush. Don't forget to air the place out before painting because paint consists of injurious substance to health. On top of that dry the finished things for two hours. Finally making a bookcase is completed when you should slide the shelf into place. Congratulations your wooden bookcase is finished and ready to use!
