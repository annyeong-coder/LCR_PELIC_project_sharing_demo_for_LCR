In my opinion I think that limiting students' time on line in their computer labs are considered some times a reasonable policy and some times an unreasonable policy. It depends in the student's situation. For instant we can say it is reasonable to limit the time of using the computer labs for many reasons. First there are limited computer labs in the school and there are a lot of students so some times you have to limit the time to give the chance for everyone to use it. Another may be some students miss the classes because they are using the computer labs in chatting or playing games instead of attending their classes. Also it is unhealthy to use the computer for a long time so it is better to limit the use of computer labs. On the other hand it is unreasonable to limit the use of the computer labs as long as you want if have to prepare a long homework or a project so you have to have enough time to prepare a complete assignment. Also it may encourage the students to use the computer labs to explore the internet and spend their time in something useful instead of wasting time outside. Some students prefer to spend all their time in using the computer so let him take the chance to use the computer labs. For me I hope that there are no limiting time in using the computer labs for any reason don't restrict the time and give every body the chance of using it for unlimited time.
