Across the history man kind tried to achieve the ultimate happiness and few did indeed. Although happiness is not a measurable quantity it is comparable so one can compare his her happiness level in deferent states or situations. Happiness is the state of being even with yourself your soul and your mind. Getting even with your self is to satisfy your needs in your life. People usually want to own things and even own other people. Satisfying your needs alone won't make you happy even more it may make you miserable in your life because it will make you greedy and hated. Getting even with your soul is to be proud of your good deeds toward others and toward your beliefs. A big part of happiness is making others who share the world with you happy. Although focusing on making others happy is noble thing to do but forgetting your self won't make you happy at all. Getting even with your mind is to work on improving yourself to be able to determine what is right and what is wrong. There is no point of getting even with your soul or getting even with yourself without being able to determine what is getting even mean. Improving yourself is always the right thing to do as it will make you more aware of the consequences of your deeds. Happiness is the ultimate goal which every one try to achieve. I think that happiness is everyone goal even if they don't know that. Happiness could be achieved by anyone by focusing in the three levels that form happiness as long as they never be separated from each other.
