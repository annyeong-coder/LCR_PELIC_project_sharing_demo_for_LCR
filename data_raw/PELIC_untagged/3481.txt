Dear. Young Dae March 20 2007 Hi. How are you Long time no see. I'd like to tell you about DVD that I want to purchase. New DVD's cost the number and kind is different from old DVD's. New DVD is more expensive than Old DVD. New DVD's costs are 13. 99 That it belong two DVDs. But Old DVD's costs are 9. 99. Also If I buy a New DVD I can get 5 off. And If I buy an old DVD the DVD is buy one get one. And the cost is different from each cost. New DVD has many different kind of movies. Movies by genre are action romance drama and other genres. But Old DVD doesn't have many genres' movies. I didn't watch many new DVDs yet but I'v already watched many old DVDs. So I want to buy new DVD. Also we can watch DVDs together at home we shouldn't go to theater. Also the DVD are very cheap during watch DVD. There are many opportunities to watch again for free. What do you think about this Let me know me please. I'll call you later. Thank you. See you soon. Bye LOVE
