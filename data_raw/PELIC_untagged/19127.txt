I think a lot of trash is the most difficult problem in Korea. We have a small territory as well do not have a lot of resources. However Seoul in Korea has a large population. They have being wasted their nature and atmosphere during they are living in city. Also environments of countryside in Korea are getting worse because they are trying to make golf courses and cottages for rent. It makes the environment noisy and dirty. As solutions people in Korea are trying to recycle the goods such as note books toilet paper and soaps which are made of oil. We have been separated collocation by using refuse cart since 1990s. We do not use stuff once it means we usually use our own cups plates. We should have efforts to preserve our environments.
