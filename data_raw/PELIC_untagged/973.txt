An important person in my life was my grand mother. She passed away last year she helped me and spoiled when I was young. When I was young I have been considering be a dentist but I had decided not to go to dental school because my parents did not have enough money however my grand mother insisted that I go an excellent college and she also suggested that she would help me by lending some money. I think that if she had not helped me I would not have been a dentist. I think that if someone have a bit of help she or he will have a career. On the other hand I remenber few months before she died she told me if you were you I would get married because I want to see you in your wedding day but it was not possible because she died five months before I got married but I think that if I had seen her that day I would have kissed her and told her thank you for all! My grand mother could not be with me in my wedding but I felt that she was in my heart.
