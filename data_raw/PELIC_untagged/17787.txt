Once upon a time someone called me from the cable company she tried to talk me into signing up with them. I was not in the right mood for these things so I hanged up on her but she didn't give up. After five minutes she called me back and tried to let me think over her offer. Then I came up with new idea I told her to hold on but I did not come back. Finally she figure it out and hanged up.
