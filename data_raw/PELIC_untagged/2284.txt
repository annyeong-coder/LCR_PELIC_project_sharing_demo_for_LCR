I met one of my girl friend at the bar. I was drinking a beer when we met. We looked each other and then I asked do you wanna dance And then we danced for a while we left the bar together with our friends too. I had some friends she had some friends at the bar. After we met we interduiced our friends each other. Our friends became friends together. We became boy friend and girl friend. We dated for two years and then . . . .
