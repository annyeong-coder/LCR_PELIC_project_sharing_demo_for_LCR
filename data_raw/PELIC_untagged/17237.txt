I met my best friend in 1991. In fact in the first time I did not get on well with him . I remember in the first time when the professor closed the class room we were fighting out side. After a few days I found him by coincidence out side of the city. He was facing trouble situation. That was his car run out of gas. And he did not have enough money while he was looking at me deeply I gave him some money. The interesting thing it was we did not say one word . While the students having their lunch he invited me to have a cup of tea. However I appreciated it and we became best friends . While we were speaking and joking the student were looking at us wonder . This story is form my real life. .
