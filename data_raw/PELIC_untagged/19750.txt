When I confront the starting of long weekend I have a dilemma should I have to go out or just take a rest at house. Generally I aspire to hang out with my friends but coordinating some plans is so difficult for me in the U. S. The first problem is that I don't have many friends. If I had many friends it would be easy to launch a plan for a trip. The second problem is that I don't have my car. I can take a bus but It is very uncomfortable for me to move without a car. The last problem is weather. I don't like rain but It is always raining in Pittsburgh. In this situation I can't manage the plan for long weekend. Fortunately I seek consolation in the trip to Atlanta which is warmer than Pittsburgh. I think the trip is a great memory to remember.
