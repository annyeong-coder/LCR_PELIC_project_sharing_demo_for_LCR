I have been to Atlanta last weekend. This was a trip coodinated as an ELI activity. I enjoyed sightseeing and the time spending with friends. I was impressed in Coca Cola company the most among the sightseeing. They showed a lot of past campaigns recalled my memory and suprised me by the large scale project and offered drink of all over the world Coca Cola products. When I was talking and drinking with friends we sometimes revealed own worries each other. It was difficult for me to explain and understand in English but I tried them and throve on them a little. The only displeasure is what my flights delayed especially the return flight arrived at past 12 00 am! Though I wasn't accessable by bus my classmate gave me a ride home.
