Hi! I'm Masumi. I'd like to introduced about my hobby dancing Hula. I'd started to dance Hula when I had been living in Indonesia. Actually I had watched Hula dance in Japan 10 years ago. Since then I had been hoping to dance for long time. Fortunatelly I met a good teacher in Indonesia and started Hula. I have been living Pittsburgh since October in last year. I have joined the Hula studio in Pittsburgh. I have been dancing Hula for 4 years. Hula is one of important life work for me.
