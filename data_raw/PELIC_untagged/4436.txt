Firstly we should check all the information about the Niagara falls on the internet and we got better refill our oil tank check our van and buy some snacks for the trip in advance. Secondly prepare a few coins for the pass fee of highway is also necesarry. If we do stick to our plan we are pretty sure that we will have a good time when we arrive at the Niagara falls.
