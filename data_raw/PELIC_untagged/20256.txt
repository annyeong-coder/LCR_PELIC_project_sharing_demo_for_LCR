My mother acknowledged my inherent creativity which was arrangement for music when I was 4 years old. At that time my house had a small organ so I used to play this after school. I could play the piano and make melody very well even thought I didn't read music and hadn't taken piano lessons. After that she took me a music school to enhance my ability however I couldn't adapt the school teaching style. At first I was engrossed with frameworks of music but my teacher evaluated very strict my music which I wrote. I thought music has an infinite number of melody why didn't my teacher foster my potential Little by little I was deprived of my enthusiasm. Consequently my intrinsic ability declined.
