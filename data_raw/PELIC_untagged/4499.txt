I have been most influenced by the politician whose name is Hak Kyu Sohn. He had been a former governor in my hometown before he decided to run for the president next year. However other politicians in his party had him resigned recently. When he was college student in 1960s he was caught many times to the police due to the democratic movement. At that time he was believed to be a counter revolutionist. Democratic Movement was considered as treason to the Military Regime in 1960s. The police had him tortured whenever he was caught to the police station. In spite of these obstacles he went through all his difficulties with strong faith to the democracy. Also during his formative years as a politician he is regarded to be the best governor by the people. Last year he was picked as the best politician who should be the next president by the journalists. So I am inspired by his political philosophy and way of thoughts to the people.
