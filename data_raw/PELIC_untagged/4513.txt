I met my friend Milena when I was studying to my medical exams. She was studying too. When I saw her she was writing an email for his boyfriend and then my other friend Anna introduced me and this is the way how I met her. She was wearing a white and black blouse blue jeans and very ugly shoes when I saw her shoes I started to smile but I never told her why I was smiling. I think she knew but she preferred continue with our conversation. Then we started a very friendly relationship. Sometimes when she was talking with me I thought about our lives because we spent a lot of time studying and we forgot the mean real of the life.
