Oct 16 2006 Dear Mom It has been six months since I moved here. I think I am getting accustomed to living in the USA. By the way if you are going to buy a cell phone you should buy a Japanese cell phone because American's cell phone is different from Japanese cell phone in many ways. First American's cell phone is bigger than Japanese cell phone. Next American's cell phone has fewer features than Japanese cell phone. For example Japanese cell phone usually has camera feature long e mail feature and TV with a cell phone. In my opinion American may cherish old products in other words American often use the well used cameras. In addition American often talks to someone anytime and anywhere however Japanese hate to irrupt when we are doing something. I mean we can't talk to someone anytime and anywhere so I think e mail feature is convenient for us. Finally therein before I think American's cell phone is less clear than Japanese cell phone. I feel I can't understand something what you say even when I know context. As above I recommend you Japanese cell phone. Love
