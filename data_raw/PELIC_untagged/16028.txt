Before I came to the U. S. I should have thought about my future deep . I could have gone to any country but I preferred to come here because the U. S has the best universities in the world. I am facing a big problem now because my visa is expired and I want to go back to my home for visiting my parents but the visa takes me one month at least until I get it. I ought to have been aware of this issue before. Should I have waited until the new system of the visa which gives students five years occurs I do not know but I ought not to have been waiting until new and then ask this question because everything is done.
