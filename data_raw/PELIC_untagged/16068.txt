When I was young I did several mistakes which caused negative consequences. I wish I could change many things I did. I should have studied more English. I could have gone to much better university. I ought not to have worked in this job. I could have asked my parents for advices to choose my major. I might have thought deeply before I chose my major. I should not have done choice with out asked for help. But we can not turn back the time.
