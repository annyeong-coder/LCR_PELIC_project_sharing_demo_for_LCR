The existence of death penalty is ambiguous and controversial. Some say it should be extended some say it should be abolished. Since several thousand years ago there has been death penalty such as execution in front of the public in ancient China or hanging criminals in 15th century's France. However this controversy has been argued for almost 100 years. Although people say death penalty makes our society safe and better. I think it is time to abolish it because it does not help decrease criminal rate. Also people do not have right to execute criminals who also have right to live. Furthermore it may cause permanent damage on innocent people who are wrongfully sentenced to death . Therefore I suggest we should abolish death penalty.
