I was born in Warsaw and I grown up in the suburb of capital city. I have earned degrees from Warsaw School of Economics. I studied economics. After I finished my education I got the job in the accounting and controlling department. I have worked for the international company since 1998. I have always enjoyed working in a multicultural environment so I took my chance and applied for the job in the headquarters. I got the job abroad and I moved to Germany in 2001. I lived in Cologne for six years. I usually went on vacation to the foreign countries. I have traveled to many places in Europe and in the world. I have been in Asia many times but the stay in Cambodia was the best. I started dreaming about this trip 10 years ago but at that time a traveling for tourists was not allowed. Finally I visited Cambodia 4 years ago. I have seen a lot interesting temples however the Ankor Wat was the most amazing.
