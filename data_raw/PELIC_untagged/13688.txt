I live in an apartment alone. This is my first time cutting off my parents' help. Sometimes It brings me down that nobody is at home when I come back . So to forget the fact I'm alone I usually turn on my MP3 player and turn up the volume when I return to my house. Because of the same reason I fixed up my room brightly with illuminators and a yellowish green bed sheet.
