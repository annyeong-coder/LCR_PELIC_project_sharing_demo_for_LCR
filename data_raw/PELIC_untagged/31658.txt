My dream has changed a lot since I was an elementary school student. When I received a book The Mistery of Paraoh I was so excited. I hoped that I could travel overseas and find treasures. I wanted to be an archaeologist. One day I realized a serious truth. Although an archaeologist travels a lot the possibility of finding treasures is very low. At the same time I fell in love with a doctor who is a main character in Robin Cook's novels. I dreamed being a doctor while I read the novel series. However the real life was so different from books. One of my cousin who was a medical school student was always too tired to do adventure. He didn't have interests about revealing the hidden truth. Since my favorite genre for books changed my dream was changed again. When I was thirteen I was absorbed into John Grisham's novels. I hope to be an attorny who is digging the truth and justice though I was not good at chinese characters and literature which is one of the key subjects in the bar exam to be a lawyer in Korea.
