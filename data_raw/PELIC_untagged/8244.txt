When I was in nine grade I had the best meal I have ever had. It was a home economics assignment that first each group had to go shop for what they wanted to cook second make a meal for themselves and third they had to eat it. It was really exciting because all of us did not have any experience of cooking and we could not ask adults for help. So it began. We cooked soup pieces of fish eggs sushi and meat. First the soup was corn pottage. Actually we bought a bag that was already done for us we just need to put it in the hot water and cooked for 20 minutes. Well our teacher did not know and it looked like we cooked from the first step to the last in the photograph. Then the pieces of fish. It was the most difficult dish we have ever made because there weren't any that were done for sold. So we put some oil then some slices ginger and cut up an onion and two small carrots. When they were cooked we put the pieces of fish into them with some salt and scrambled them till all of them were done. For eggs we made scrambled eggs. This was the easy one for all of us who could not cook. It just need some oil eggs and a pinch of salt. We bought sushi from a store because everyone knew how to make sushi and we did not want to spend too many time on cooking. And the last one the meat. We cooked it with some oil ginger garlic salt and carrots. It was fun when we were doing cooking. Everyone helped each other some of us were cooking and some of us were cutting food. We talked and made some jokes while we were cooking. At the end we sat down and ate all the food we cooked. We also took a lot of pictures during the assignment. It was a wonderful afternoon and meal I have ever had.
