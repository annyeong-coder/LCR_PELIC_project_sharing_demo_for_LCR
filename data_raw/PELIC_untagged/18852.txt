When I was 5 years old my parents made me play an instrument so I chose to play the piano. Then I started my classes with a piano teacher. He helped me learn how to read partitures. At the begining it was difficult for me but then I started to read the partitures in the same way I would read a book. After that I began reading partitures and played small songs for my level it was very funny and I enjoyed going to my classes every day. He had a lot of patience with me and he let me make mistakes when I was playing but after I was done my song he corrected my mistakes and I started the song from the beginig. I began to improve my skills and week after week I learned a new classical song. He got me to play songs that I didn't think I could play. I appreciate his help and his patience I will always remember what he taught me.
