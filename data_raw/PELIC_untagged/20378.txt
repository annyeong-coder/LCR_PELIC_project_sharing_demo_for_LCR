I'm glad to help you. I think your problem is about your parents adhering to old custom. For my suggestion there are three steps to attack this problem. First opening your heart talks to your parents why do you love Jim and how good does Jim You need to convince your parents to like him. Second taking Jim advises your parents. Yon need to indicate the good parts of Jim to your parents. Third arranging a party makes your parents and Jim's parents know each other. You need to demonstrate when you stay with Jim and his parents you will be fine and happy. If you follow three steps above I am sure that your parents would allow you to marry with Jim.
