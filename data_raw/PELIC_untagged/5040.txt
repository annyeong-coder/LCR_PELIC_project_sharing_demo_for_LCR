I have thought about buying water but I haven't because I need to buy a lot of water. I consume water very quickly so I have to buy 35 bottles of water every two weeks. I have thought about going to a supermarket by car but I cannot drive. That's why I plan to buy water with my husband this weekend. I have also thought about calling my mother but I have not called her yet because the time difference is very big between Japan and the United States. It is always difficult to choose an appropriate time. I will call her tommorow.
