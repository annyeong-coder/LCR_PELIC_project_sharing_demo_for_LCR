Zojirushi's and panasonic's rice cooker has similarities and diffirences. First of all both of them has two similatries. They are for cooking rice. In addition they keep the rice warm for a long time. On the other hands Zojirushi and panasonic have three diffirences. The Zojirushi brand is more expansive than the panasonic brand. For example praice is 179 after discaunt and panasonic price is 45. 73. Has multi menu selections but panasonic doesn't. Moreover Zojirushi has reheat cycles however panasonic just keeps warm four hours. All in all I prefer Zojirushi instead of panasonic because it is more modern even though it is more expansive. In my country there is a saying which is more expansive means more quality and that actually what I beleive.
