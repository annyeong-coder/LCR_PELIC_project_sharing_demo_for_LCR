Hi I'm ANON_NAME_0. I have been living in Pittsburgh for more than one year. I have written this page to introduce myself. As a student I have been a work hard people. When I was a Child my parents asked me to study hard and try to do every course well. I have been used to in this condition and it has been going through my whole life. On the other hand I have been a good soccer player since I was five years old. I like playing soccer greatly and I have ever been the member of school team when I was in high school. Even now I play soccer every Saturday afternoon. My life is wonderful here. As you see I have upload many pictures to the website and maybe you have been attracting by them. I hope you enjoy them.
