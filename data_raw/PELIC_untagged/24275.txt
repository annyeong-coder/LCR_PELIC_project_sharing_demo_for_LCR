When I was 10 years old I could not drive a car but now I can. Sometimes I wonder myself if I could if only I had a car. At that age I was not able also to speak English Today I am able indeed. What a good time when I was able to draw very well. Unfortunately today I cannot draw as well as I used to do it 13 years ago. I think if I train every day I will be able to draw better again. More I practice better I can.
