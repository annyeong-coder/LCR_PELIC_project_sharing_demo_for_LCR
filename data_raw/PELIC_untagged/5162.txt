I like to travel and to visit different places very much. I've always been saving money for visiting new places. The last week I went to Florida with my cousins. I had never been there. We visited Orlando and Kissimmee. We wanted to visited Miami too but our car brokedown so we returned to Orlando for fixing the car. The trip was very exciting although we couldn't go to Miami.
