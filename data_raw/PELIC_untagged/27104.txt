In the last summer I visited many places One of them is a New York City I went there with my husband First we took a tour around the city we went to state of liberty and we went to empire state building the views outside are amazing also we spent time in time square in the last day I went to shopping I found all my favorite brands there We couldn't stay more than five days because it is so expansive.
