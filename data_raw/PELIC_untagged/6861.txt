Usually people work because they need money to live. However there are numerous of people have anther style to look at work. They might combine many reasons together when they decide to work but still for everyone one more desirable reason than others surfaces above and showing the important reason to this person of being working. In my opinion the reasons of work can be divided to three reasons for exploiting free time in better way for getting popular and for making social relationship. First reason is that to have the work in order to using the free time in useful way. Some students like to get job in their summer vacation to have more experience of the work environment. So they will be able to prepare them self to their dream carrier. Moreover the students can improve their ability in their field of study by assimilate job related to their future carrier. Second reason is that the work helping some people to become popular and famous.
