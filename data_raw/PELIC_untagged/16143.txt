I think practicing a sport for several hours a day is good use of time. My buddy Jack is a soccer player. He always says he can conserve good shape of his body as practicing soccer every day and the sake of practicing is for his health. However He said Don't be immoderate every day. It could hurt your body . Appropriate amounts of practicing every day will keep you be healthy.
