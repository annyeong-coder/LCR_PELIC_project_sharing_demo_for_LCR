In the past few days there was a judgment trial about a murdering in my country. The fact that the father killed his own daughter shocked me. I was shocked by the fact that this poor girl felt off through the window on the sixth floor of the building. However wasn't an accident. What shocked me was the fact that the father threw his daughter through the window. This crime provokes the public opinion and everybody was shocked by the fact that the stepmother helped the father to committee this horrendous crime. I was surprise by the fact that the father tried to convince the police that another person committed the crime. However the investigators looked into and discovered that the father and stepmother were the real criminals in this case.
