From Wiley's point of view women and men need to live in the same world. If they did not live in the same world the world would mess up because men need to be controlled by women and women require men's support. I agree part of his perspective. They really need each other and help each other but both of them are aggressive and helpless. They just show in different ways. Biologically men's bodies are stronger than women's. They play different roles in the society. Men can guard their property and do heavy job. Women are able to pay more patience to do something and take care of home well. Although nowadays some women can do as well as men and vice versa there are not in the majority of our society. If women did all what men do the scene of the world would be great different. Women would have strong bodies and men would be thin gradually. If so the pregnancy could be man's job.
