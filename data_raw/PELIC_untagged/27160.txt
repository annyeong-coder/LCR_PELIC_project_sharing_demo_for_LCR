HI my name is ANON_NAME_0 and before I came to the U. S. I had never studied English like in the ELI . Also I had never lived away from my family . Also I had never studied with girls and boys at the same class whether in school or university . Also in my country I had been taken lessons from woman whether in school or university but here I take lessons from both of them then sometime woman are better than men in teaching . Also I had never played American Football but here I play it for one time and it will be the last time because I didn't like it . Also I had never met with non arab friend but here in the U. S. I met with many friends from everywhere .
