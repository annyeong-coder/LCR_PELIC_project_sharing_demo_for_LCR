Normally my wife cooks for us me and our kids almost everyday except at weekends. Sometimes when she feels tired or sick we either eat out or we buy meals from a restaurant. One day during last Ramadan she was not feeling well. She suggested that I cook for all of us since we have many ingredients in our refrigerator. I then decided to take a chance to experience real cooking. I started by cutting two onions into small pieces. When I asked my wife for instructions she preferred not to be in the kitchen because she is tired and also she did not want her clothes to catch the cooking smell especially from the onion. I faced the difficulty of cutting the onions that cause my eyes to tear. Then I cut two green peppers two tomatoes three boneless chicken breasts into small pieces. I used little of cooking oil on large pan over heat. I fried all the ingredients together. I put some salt pepper and some of Fajita sauce. At the end I was surprised that everyone liked what I cooked. I think it is a complement from my wife to encourage me. May be that was to replace some of her cooking times in the future.
