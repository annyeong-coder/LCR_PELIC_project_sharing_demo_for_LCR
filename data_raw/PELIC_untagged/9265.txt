My favorite movie is Notting Hill directed by Roger Michell in 1999. The movie starring Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant nominated for three Golden Globes. The genre of the movie is comedy and romance. In the movie Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant both of whom are very famous played an actress in the U. S. And an ordinary guy in England. In the movie we can see beutiful scenes most of which were shot in England. I recommend the movie because it's a kind of Cinderella story and we can feel happy after watching the movie.
