The real reason why people don't take good care of their parents is that they are busy. Busy with their work family but what they really don't realize is that their parents are their family and they are the ones who should be taking care off. Older people just want to enjoy their time with their grandchildren taking them to the shopping mall try to learn them something that they will be remembered for make influence on their life that's why we must take care of our parents. Older people must have their wishes come true for just one time in their life and we should give a hand for those who mostly need it. If the problem isn't solved then we are looking forward to a bigger problem. The next generation might lose the connection and the relations with their family older people will know that in the end they will be ended in a house full of oldies waiting for their time to come. This isn't the way our parents should think in the future.
