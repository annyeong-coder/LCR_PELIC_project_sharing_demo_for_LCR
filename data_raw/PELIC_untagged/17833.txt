Last three years when I applied to work and travel in USA program I knew Nida and Yok. We worked together in Sequoia National Park and became close friends. Nida who wears blue dress can speaks three languages Thai English and Korean. She was exchange student in Korea for one year. Nida whose boyfriend lives in Arizona will come to the USA to do her internship soon. Yok who wears gray shirt was accepted by University of Oregon which in the west coat last month. So two of my close friends will live in the USA for a while that make me so happy. Yok whose name means Jade will go to Oregon on August and Nida is looking for a company to do her internship now. After I complete ELI course I will move to Oregon to do my master's degree. So at least Yok and I will live in same state. This picture we took on Valentine's Day with a cute big bear after Nida got back from Korea two weeks.
