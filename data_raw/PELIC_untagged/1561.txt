Adjective Prepositional phrases Fast running in playground Long jump on sandy ground Sit up exercising in gym One of the things that I have been successful at was getting an A in physical class when O was in high school. I had three tests. First I did fast running in the playground for about 50m. I didn't train but I've always liked exercise so I think it helped my fast running. For example sometimes I played ball game with my friends and I used to play basketball with my brother. The limit of the A degree was 84 seconds. Second I did the long jump on sandy ground. I jumped over 1m. Finally I did sit up exercising in gym. The limit was over 45 times for a minute. I got all A for them and I was a unique person in my class so I was glad.
