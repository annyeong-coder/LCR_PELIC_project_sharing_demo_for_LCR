Smoking is a bad habit which so many people pursue. Cigarette and especially when consumed a lot causes many harmful effects on not only the smokers but also other people such as causing bad health wasting of money and causing a nuisance for non smokers as well as people trying to stop smoking. Smoking is dangerous to our health. Tobacco contains three dangerous substances which are nicotine tar and carbon monoxide. Nicotine can cause both respiratory and circulatory diseases. Tar is a sticky mixture of many chemicals which can cause cancer. Carbon monoxide causes less oxygen to be carried by blood to different cells. As a result many people in the world die or have internal diseases because they smoke cigarette. The second reason why smoking is a bad habit is the fact that it wastes money since it is expensive in most countries. For example many people in my country stopped smoking because they realized that they will spend a lot of money on buying cigarettes over a long time. As a result often people who smoke have good income. The third effect is causing a nuisance for non smokers and people who try to stop smoking. So in many countries it is prohibited to smoke in public places. For example in the U. S it is not allowed to smoke in almost all public places but in my country such proposal is still being examined. Also smoking can cause peoblems for people who try to stop smoking. For example usually people who try to stop smoking avoid going to places where smokers could be found because they do not have volition to see smokers and do not smoke. Finally nicotine is an addictive drug and hard to stop taking. So young people must be aware of its dangers before they think of smoking. Moreover I think that there should be serious regulations about smoking in all the countries around the world.
