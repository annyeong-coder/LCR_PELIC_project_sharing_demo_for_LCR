Shanghai where I grew up is a big city in China. My family moved there when I was 15 years old. I had a lot of friends who lived in my hometown but Shanghai which is a prosperous city is still my favorite city. It is a city that attracts a lot of tourists. I knew a good frend who lived next door. I thought she was a person whose friends are important to her so I loved her. We often played together. I liked to live in Shanghai. It is different from my hometown.
