It's always interesting and fun to find the personality that fits you looking at the categories in the book I found three personalities' which represent who I am. First of all I am an introvert because introverts are those whose energy is activated by being alone. Secondly I am a thinker because I am a man who thinks a lot before making any decision which makes my friend call boring since I don't just do things like them but I have to think about them first. Lastly I am a judger because the judger is the one who prefer a predictable environment.
