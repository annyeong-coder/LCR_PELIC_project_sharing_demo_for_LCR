Today I am going to talk about my friend who is one of the most important persons for me I have ever met. Between us exists a friendship which lasts now since 14 years. In him I found a person who accept me exactly as I am and also found a person whom I can confine in any matter. His has kind of empathy which means he knows exactly about my feelings. We can laugh and we can also cry together. My friend who I am talking about is a fabulous soul mate which means he is similar in my thought and my feeling. That's why we trust each for a long time which means that we trust each other exactly since 14 years.
