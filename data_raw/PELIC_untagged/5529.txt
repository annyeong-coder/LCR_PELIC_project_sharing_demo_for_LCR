I totally agree with the author's views. Because I was suffered from surveillance and a heavy evaluation pressure when I was young I could feel how it influenced on kid's creativity in a negative way. In my remembrance I just memorized and repeated what I learned rather than thought how it was made because I was afraid to be punished by my teachers. I think that it is one of an examples why the creativity killers are negative and the author's views are right.
