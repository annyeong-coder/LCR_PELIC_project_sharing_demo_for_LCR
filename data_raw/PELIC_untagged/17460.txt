One year ago my son and I went to Guam Island. I did everything about preparing to trip as well as making a reservation hotel because my husband could not go with us. We spend much time there around all week. One of day we did a snorkeling and played with a lot of beautiful fish in the sea with my son. The other days we ate some delicious food and went to shopping all day. The rest of day we spend a lot of time at the resort. We did many activities such as canoeing and fishing.
