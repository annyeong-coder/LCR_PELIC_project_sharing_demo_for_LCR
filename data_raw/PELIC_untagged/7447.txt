I can't understand the meaning of in regard to other cultures . But the things which I can learn from Caral are as follows. Even if it is in very hard situation we can manage it and lead it to success if we have wisdom. According to usual thinking the location of Caral was never comfortable land. But people took advantage of the location by contrary and developed the city as the center of trade. If we need help of someone we should help him at first. People in Caral made nets and give them to fishermen. In reward for this they got fishes. The larger and more effective nets they made the more fishes they could get. Don't give up and keep having hope. When Caral fell people buried their structures to protect themselves. I don't know the reason but I guess that people in Caral had to think Caral would get back the glory someday. Indeed 3600 years after Caral showed up again and its structures and culture became the admiration.
