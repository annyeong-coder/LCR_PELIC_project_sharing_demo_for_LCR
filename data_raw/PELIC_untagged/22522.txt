I was in Miami Florida with my sister. One wednesday we had to return to Bogota. We traveled in diferent planes. She traveled at 3pm and I traveled at 5pm. While she was walking to her gate someone told me that my flight was late so I had to wait 4 hours. While I was waiting in Miami my sister arrived to Bogot
