Dear Confused If you are convinced that you love Jim and want to marry him you'd better go back to Japan as your parents wish. While spending a pleasant time with your family for three months show them how much you love each other and how great he is little by little. If you have any brothers or sisters persuade them to help you first. If you make your parents sure about your future happiness you can succeed in getting married. It is an effective way that Jim will visit your parents when your parents begin to waver. I wish your parents to change their minds. Good luck to you and Jim.
