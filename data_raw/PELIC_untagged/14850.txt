In my opinion the best place to eat lunch in Pittsburgh is in its beautiful nature near the rivers that named Point State Park. Today the most important human necessity is relaxation although I didn't go there before but as the picture demonstrated it is obvious that this point of pittsburgh is a very nice situation to take relaxation meanwhile we eat lunch. In addition there has tree rivers beside itself that create a very well weather specially in summer and eating lunch in this condition is so pleasant for us. Finally it seems that the Point State Park is a entertaining place and it can be very satisfactory to have both lunch and fun for us.
