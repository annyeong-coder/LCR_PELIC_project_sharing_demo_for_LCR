Yesterday I talked to my roommate and I asked him questions about his future. He is going to visit his family in Saudi Arabia after he finishes this semester. Before he leaves United States he is going to overcome some problems that he had. After that he will get a job after he finishes the collage. As soon as he gets a job he will look for a car. After he gets a job he is going to fiend a new place. While he looks for a house he will fiend a partner.
