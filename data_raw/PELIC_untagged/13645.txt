I can't remember when was it but it was on weekend. I was sleeping when my phone rang. I woke up early because of the call so I was little bit upset from it. First I was not going to pick up the phone but suddenly I wanted to figure out who made me wake up. The phone still went on ringing. I picked it up and tried to talk into the person. However an automatic voice was coming up and it said about some research. I was so annoyed so that I hung up right away. If this phone call is called back again to me maybe I can kill them.
