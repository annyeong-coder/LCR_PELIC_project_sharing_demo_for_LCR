Hi. My name is ANON_NAME_0 Last Name but my Colombian friends call me Lola. I am 18 year old. I am from Colombia but this year I am living with my brother and his girlfriend in Pittsburgh PA because I am studying English and later I want to study my career in the U. S. First I am going to talk about my hobbies. I like to play soccer when I was in the High School I was in the female team of soccer. I love dance and in Colombia I used to go out to dance with friends. I like to eat chocolates but in the U. S. I am trying to not eat a lot. Second I am going to talk about my personality I am sensitive with my feeling I am a supportive person because I like to help people when they are going through bad moments. Also I am not a easygoing person and I am very slow because I like every being perfect. Finally my family laughs me to be a respectful and modest girl.
