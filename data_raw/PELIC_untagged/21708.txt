The most exciting meal experience I have ever had happened about a year ago. I participated in the ELI night and it was my first time to encounter the Middle Eastern food which is called Kabsa. First I was very surprised because Arabian students served it on the very big plate which had a diameter of two meters almost six to seven feets . There were many ELI students who sit and encircled that plate and enjoyed it. In addition to this exotic served manner it was really tasty! The combination among Lamb Onion and Tomato was out of my imagination and the flavor which was made by the several spices was outstanding. I decided to cook Kabsa because I wanted to have it again. I asked an Arabian student how to cook them. He was kindly enough to teach me how to make it. According to his recipe I had to prepare for these required ingredients two pounds of chicken 4 medium onions one and half tablespoons of crushed garlic two tablespoons of ginger and a cup of oil. I cooked it and it was really tasty.
