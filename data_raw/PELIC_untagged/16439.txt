I don't think to meet someone through internet dating is a good idea. First It would be dangerous because the person would be a rapist. Second Some of Rapist try to find they target by internet. It is so obvious that the technology helps people with good intention and without good intention. Third Rapist would try to acquire as much as information his can and at the first dating the rapist would follow the target to get as much as information he would. Rapists are capable to do whatever they need to achieve they target. We never know who can be at the other side of screen. Meeting someone through internet dating isn't a good idea.
