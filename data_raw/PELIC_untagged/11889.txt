Topic Disposing of Garbage Imagine that you live in the world full of garbage anywhere. How would you feel You would be disgusted wouldn't you Anywhere you go you would see dirty places and smell stinky air. You have to walk carefully because you don't want to step on disgusting and smelling garbage. You also don't want to drink tap water because your imagination told you that the water was contaminated. I believe clean environment is a factor that could be supported our health. And I also believe it is our responsible to create clean and healthy environment. The first step is we have to dispose the garbage properly. There are many different methods of disposing of garbage recycling is one of them. Recycling method means taking a product or material at the end of its useful life and turning it into a usable raw material to make another product. Many different materials can be recycled but each type requires a different technique. As a consequence it is important to sort them into the types of their materials. The most common types of materials that can be recycled are glass bottles cans PET bottles the examples of PET bottles include soft drinks alcoholic beverages detergents cosmetics pharmaceutical products and edible oils plastic food packaging newspaper cardboard magazines milk containers and fabric. The other types of garbage that can be recycled are batteries biodegradable waste such as flower and grass electrical equipment waste such as computer and cell phone and concrete. Do you know how to recycle Many of us might not know. Although we don't know exactly the process of recycle we can participate in it by sorting our garbage and put them in the trash bag. Littering is not a good idea. It is not about the penalty of littering. It is the matter of how we contribute in conserving the earth. In my opinion we don't posses the earth but we borrow it from our next generation.
