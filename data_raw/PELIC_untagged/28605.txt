In these common days usually when parents get older in age usually their children take them to the care center or put them in houses to live with other old people and the nurses' looks after them. Their children think that this is a very easy way to drop them in a care center. However the parents took care of their children and raise them up so at least they should take care of them. The parents took care of their children all the past years and grew them up. They gave their children everything they needs they worked hard to support them with their needs cloth entering schools and all the many things and to let them enjoy their life. So the least thing that the children must do is taking care of their parents in their home and provides them with everything they need. They must remember that when you needed them in previous days they always helped them. So you must help them when they get old. The most important thing is that old people like to be surrounded with other family members. In my country the most important one in every family is the grandparents. In every small and big issue we ask their permission. On every week we have a common day in the weekend that all the family members gather in the grandparent's house and spend the whole day with them. Most people think that when parents get older they should take them to a care center to get a good care and to be with people with their same age and have a good time and to enjoy staying there. Therefore I think that the parents love to be surrounded by their children and spent the whole time with them. The parents tried to do everything to raise their children and take care of them. So their children should keep them in their home and take care of them. Finally the children should take care of their parents not to put them in the care centers or in houses to be taken care of by other people. It's important to thank them for everything they've done for you and to provide them with everything they need.
