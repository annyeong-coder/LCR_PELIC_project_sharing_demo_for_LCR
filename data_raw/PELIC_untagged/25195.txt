Titanic the movie I saw 10 years ago is one of the best movies. James Cameron director of the movie is one of my best directors. Leonardo Decaprio the hero of the movie is my favorite actor. Kate Winslet the second character of the movie is a beautiful actor. It is about Titanic ship the famous and the biggest ship in the world. I had seen this movies many times but I always like to see it again. This movie presents a story romantic story between a girl rose loves a guy Jack lost his live to protect her.
