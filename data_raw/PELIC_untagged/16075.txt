Some of the things that I regret is when I went to Dental School after that I graduated I took just one year and a half as a volunteer I should have taken more practices as a volunteer in different hospitals and have done more practices hours I wished I should have done that I think I could have gotten more experience in my field because I might have learned more about this experiences. Now I had to work hard to reach all my goals.
