According to the article there were some arguments about Wiley's assumption. The author thought that if Wiley lived today he would not write the novel. The author also stated several examples which exist in modern days. For example he said that a lot of men take care of their children and women run business nowadays. However I think that if the author really understood the meaning of living in separate world he wouldn't use this example which was not persuasive at all. In my opinion if men and women lived in separate world there might be many problems caused by this situation. For example if there were only men in the world they couldn't form families and so do women. Second if both men and women lived in separate world they might all become more aggressive because they were lack of the soothing of families. Third if they observed that all other animals have pair of genders they might probably be confused about their single gender. Therefore I think if men and women lived in separate world humans would disappear from the world forever!
