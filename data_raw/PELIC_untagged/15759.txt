I like a lot my two bedroom apartment which is located on third floor. I wake up with morning sunshine in my bedroom which cheers me up every day. I can also see my sweet neighbor's children playing around in the large back yard from my balcony. I like to turn on the TV in living room at dinner time. The tile floor kitchen and bathroom are easy to clean up and straighten up. However the bedrooms and living room are all covered with light colored carpet and I take off my shoes before getting into apartment in order to keep the carpet clean. I give up cleaning the carpet and hope to get a new one because it's very hard to take stains off from it.
