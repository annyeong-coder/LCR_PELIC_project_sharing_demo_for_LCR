There are three main reasons that caused the Undergrad Grill fail. First of all the owner spends a lot of money in the wrong way. For example due to find a good location he paid the high rent for that. In addition he also spends too much for renovation instead of advertisement. However the renovation does not include outside and that is why his restaurant dose not has distinct apparel to others. Consequently he could not attract more and more customers. Secondly the dishes are not as good as expected. Because of he hired two waitresses he could not afford professional cooks so he hires students to do the cooking. Besides the price of food is too expensive. It does not provide any pasta nor special plan for people who do not spend too much money. Lastly the restaurant has too many rules for customers such as no bare feet no smoking no skate boards and no children under age 5. As a result of the fobbed customers feel uncomfortable. Even though they could not take out and pay by check so customers could feel inconvenient too. For the above reasons Undergrad Grill fail.
