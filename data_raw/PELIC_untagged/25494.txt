By 2004 I had been worked at the bank. I worked as customer service. Furthermore I had become successful. In now I'm studying in ELI as second language and I feel now more progressive. By July 2009 I arrived to the U. S. A . My first initial was the weather is awful but I had changed my mind. I always ask myself how long I had been studying The answer when I had improve my English. Indeed I graduated in 2006. My field is marketing. In addition I had been studying at home when I was worked in the bank. By the time I studied had been applying for study at the University.
