THE EFFECT OF POVERTY Poverty has been increasing throughout the world recently. It is apparent in some countries today. These countries have poor economies. For this reason poverty has three important effects on people live illiteracy high crimes and spread of diseases. First of all illiteracy is one of poverty's effects.

According to Curry 1988 Gang homicide Delinquency and Community. The distribution of gang homicide rates confirm to classic theories of social disorganization and poverty the distribution of delinquency rates is more generally associated with poverty .
