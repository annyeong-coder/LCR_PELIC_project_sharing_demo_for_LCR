On saturday April 26 2003 Aron Ralston wanted to ride his bike and climb the rocks just outside the canyonlands National park in southeastern Utah and he rode his bike fifteen miles to the bluejohn canyon Trailhead. He tried to climb over the top of a large boulder and while he was trying to climb the large boulder the 800 pound rock moved and trapped his right arm. He was stuck for five days. He had a vision that he saw his futuer son so he decided to free him self by cutting his arm.
