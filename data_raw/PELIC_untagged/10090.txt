The most impressive experience I've had with money was several months ago when I used a moving helper. That day I had to move a queen size bed and several chairs. We have already made arrangement for payment 30 before moving. It's not very far so it's not a big deal. He carefully put bed and chairs on the p truck and then took out a rope to string them to prevent collision when moving. He did a good job. I really appreciated it. I tipped him 20 extra besides the fee. It's really surprised him. Maybe he never received so much for just a small moving. After all my wallet let empty that day .
