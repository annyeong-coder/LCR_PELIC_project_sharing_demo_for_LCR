So I think we try to keep minority language. For example most governments make minority language school also they have to teach minority language for their young people. After read second article I thought that today most people are using English when we walking on the street and on internet web sites we can see English every where. English is general language in the world but in the course of time it will be change naturally because of a population explosion. I think too many foreigner people are living in America. When I went to PNC bank I surprised about they have Chinese Spanish and Korean service because too many foreigner people live in Pittsburgh. So I think English will be lost their hegemony.
