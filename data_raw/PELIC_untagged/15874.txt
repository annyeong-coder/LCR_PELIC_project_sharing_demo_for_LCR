One day a telemarketer called me. He said Can I take a minute I need a little time so please don't hang up and listen to me. He kept on talking If you sign up Perfect TV which offers multichannel service you can get six months free trials. I said Could you call me back at a later date Because I need more time to think it over and talk it over with my family. He said This service is only today you don't have time to think over. I said If so I'm afraid I turn it down. Then he ended up hanging up.
