The emerging of global economic crisis is in America. When a powerful country has economic problems every country which rely on America also got the effects too. There are at least three effects of global economic problems in my country Thailand such as tourism drops people do not have job and the decreasing value of money. Usually the tourists who travel to Thailand are American or Europeans when they have economic problem people in these countries try to save every penny in their pocket so there are not a lot of them travel to South East Asia. That is the reason why our tourism drops. According to tourism drops in order to sustain the companies hotels or restaurants. There is something they cannot inevitable let go employees. However there is a law which impose the owner to compensates employee who was unseated. Thais always say working for government is better than working for private company because of stability. Finally the decreasing value of money also a huge problem in my country because people make the same income but everything in their daily life is more expensive. A lot of people protest against the government then the government impose the law to restrict the price of goods. In conclusion because people try to save their money their businesses and everything is daily life is become more expensive. My country where rely on tourism also has the effects from global economic crisis.
