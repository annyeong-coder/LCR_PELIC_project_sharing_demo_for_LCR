Topic things we can learn from studying the past When agriculture was important to the country my grandmother was a farmer. She planted a lot of vegetables and grains such as asparagus corn and peanuts. She was up at five o'clock in the morning and worked until the sun set in the west. She was frugal because life was very hard. She was making money in order to give it to her son. She only had one son. I speculate that she spent the majority of her time in the field. She was glad to cooperate with other farmers. At the end of life she was sick. We were very shocked by the disaster from our family. I could not figure out what was making her sick until we went to the hospital. The doctor indicated that she lacked nutrition in her body. She died in 2005. She was silent how hard she worked and many things. She never argued and complained about anything. In my memory she was full of love. She preferred to make money rather than enjoy life. Her magnificent behavior had a great effect on me.
