My childhood bedroom which I shared with my brothers was a medium size room located in the north part of the house. There are two beds which were belonging to my brothers. The one that was in the corner was my older brother's bed. Another one was my younger brother's bed which was in the middle of the room and always has toys on the bed. Where I slept was in the corner in front of the wardrobes which across from my younger brother's bed. I slept on a thin mattress which is made from kapok cotton which is light soft and water resistant fiber. There was a big window at the north where the wind flows into the room every time we opened the window. The cupboard which was behind my brothers' beds was a big showcase cupboard which we used it to keep our toys dolls and books. My older brother hung up his favorite boy band poster Backstreet Boys on the wall next to his bed. After we grew up we live in the separate rooms. I really miss the time when we were living together.
