There is a bedroom I still live in that is personal and perfect. First when I enter my bedroom I see the wall which is white and has a poster. For instance I posted my favorite band's photos on my wall and I chose what kind of things I wanted to post. When I see these posters I can feel I am in my own space. I am in a private space. Next to the right of the wall is my desk. For example I chose my desk from the store and I chose the one I really liked. I like candies and music so much so I put candies and CD player on my desk. When I wake up I always turn on my CD player and eat a candy. Its makes me feel everything is perfect. I will have good luck in the whole day. Finally next to the desk is my lovely and comfortable bed. I chose my own sheet. When I feel uncomfortable I like to lie on my bed. Its makes me feel personal and calm. There is a doll on my bed. I really like it because my dad gives it to me. In short my favorite room is a private and calm place that allows me to do anything I want.
