Thesis Statement Death penalty should be abolished. One reason why it should be abolished is that it is not an effective way to reduce the rate of crime. Even though one of the purposes of death penalty is to prevent potential criminals from committing a cruel crime like murder it is still happening constantly and the statistics show that there is no evidence that the rate of crime is reduced because of death penalty. On the contrary it is increased in several countries. Therefore death penalty should be abolished and other effective alternatives must be discussed.
