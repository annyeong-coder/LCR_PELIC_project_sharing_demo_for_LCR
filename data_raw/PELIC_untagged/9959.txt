John is on of my best friends. He is a construction worker and he works for a construction company. He usually goes to work at 7 00 in the morning but it's always at midnight when he comes home. His job is very dangerous and hard. He often works on the high place and uses the large scale mechinery in a building site. He needs to spend many strengh and keep his mind on works because the process of build a house are very difficult and multifarious. Although his job is very hard he enjoys his work and makes a good wages. But he has a hope. He wants to be a architectural designer and then he will design and build his own house by himself.
