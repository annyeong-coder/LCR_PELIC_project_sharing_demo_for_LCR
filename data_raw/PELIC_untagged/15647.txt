If I had not gotten married with my husband I would not live in Pittsburgh right now. Supposing that I had gotten married with him my life would be different if my husband had not made a decision to research his work in the US. At least I would not study English in the ELI at the University of Pittsburgh. Whenever I am studying English at the ELI I wish I could have study English harder in my high school. Because I belonged to a badminton club as a captain I did not have enough time to study English. When I first came to Pittsburgh two years ago I could not to make a decision to go to the ELI. I had mostly spent time at home for a long time without studying English. If I had made a decision to study at the ELI soon I could speak English more fluently and have much more friends right now. I wish I could improve my English someday. I do not want to regret any more such as I wish I had studied harder at that time.
