There a lot of reasons why Five Guys is my favorite place to eat lunch in Oakland. In fact There are no freezers at any Five Guys restaurants. So they use only fresh never frozen meat. In addition They use only Idaho potatoes and as we know Idaho is well known for its potatoes. Moreover peanut oil is only oil used for cooking in all their locations. Furthermore they serve the best burger ever cross the country and they won many awards for their burger. Finally if you have never be there I strongly recommend that you go and try it.
