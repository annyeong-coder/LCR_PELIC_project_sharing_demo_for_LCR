If I had not been born I think the world would have change a lot for my family and teammates. I have a younger brother. If I had not been born my brother's name would have been ANON_NAME_0 Long Lin and he would have felt boring because nobody could fight and play with him. My family did have to have bought a big car. If I never have existed my parents would have lived easily and wouldn't have paid more attention for me. In our badminton team my partners might have had another partner if I didn't have joined with them. If the team had not had me they might not have won a championship or they could have won many champions.
