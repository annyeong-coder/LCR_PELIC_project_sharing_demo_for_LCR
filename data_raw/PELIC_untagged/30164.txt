Many countries still have the death penalty. For example the U. S. China Japan and Taiwan. The death penalty has been discussed and argued for decades however most people in those countries think that death penalty still play an important role in the legal system. Although some people said that death penalty could solve criminal problems I still insist that the death penalty should be prohibited. Some people think that the death penalty can stop criminals technically however there are some researches indicate that the death penalty cannot reduce the criminal rate. In addition some people who are sentenced to death may be innocent. If they are innocent the death penalty may kill the wrong people. Also although many people think that death penalty can threaten criminals who ignore and violate people's rights of living the death penalty also violates the criminals' rights of living.
