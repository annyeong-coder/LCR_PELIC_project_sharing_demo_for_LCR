Despite the tens of calls I've received since I arrived to the U. S I still have a difficulty figuring out the American's speech at the other end of the phone. I don't find out why they love to keep on talking with no commas or take their breaths. The story I settled on is an example of my suffering with such a situation. A few days after I bought my car while I was still busy with signing up my blue Chevrolet I picked up my cell phone to answer the following call A man Hello is this Mr. Adam Me He probably meant to say ANON_NAME_0 Yes The man This is his name which I am not able think back on from the dealer office where you bought your car. Me Ok The man In order to get through with the registration procedures I'm in need to go over some details for your warranty form and also I need some information about you like your ID number and . Me I'll stop by your place tomorrow between 4 and 6 pm. Is that work with you The man that's great. I'll expect you to come over before 6 when I usually close ok me Ok When Mr. Something hung up I woke up my brain started over and my head got full of a lot of questions. I decided to end up my suspense and I called him back. Overall an agency where I registered my car made a mistake and gave wrong my number to that man. He truthfully wanted Mr. Adam
