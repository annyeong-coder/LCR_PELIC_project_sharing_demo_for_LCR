If I had to choose from those items I would rather take an ax fresh water a tropical plants book a fishing equipment and fire works I will take an ax to defend my self and cut the object I might facing I'm going to take a fresh water to avoid being thirsty. When I feel hungry it should be a plants that I can eat to provide the power to me in case I didn't have any proper food. If I will be in an island so it's surrounding from the water and fishing it might be a good way to provide a deferent kind of food. And I'll put the fire work incase if I need help I'll use them to stop the passing people to this island.
