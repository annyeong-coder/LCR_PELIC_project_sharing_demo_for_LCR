In my home I usually feel good especially when my sister helps me out something. For example when I come back home after school I feel tired. But if my sister is cooking dinner for me it cheers me up. Thus I count on her a lot. Also when weather is too cold if my home is warm I feel happy. However I sometimes feel bad in my home. When my room is messy so I can't find my stuff it lets me down. Also I have to straighten up my room. It's troublesome.
