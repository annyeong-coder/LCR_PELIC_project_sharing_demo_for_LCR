Language is a tool of communication so it is crucial for our daily lives. Every country might not only has one language that habitants can speak. For example there are two kinds of language which are Mandarin Chinese and Taiwanese in Taiwan. Taiwanese government does not permit students to speak Taiwanese in schools. If students speak Taiwanese in schools they will be punished. About eight years ago the government realized that Taiwanese might be eliminated if the language policy is unchanged. So the government enhanced the policy because they want to preserve Taiwanese. Taiwanese is a language that you can not learn from vocabulary words. For instance I learned how to speak Taiwanese from my grandmother's oral language. It is a valuable language that includes a lot of meaningful idioms. Nowadays the government tries to generate vocabulary words for Taiwanese. Then students can learn it quickly and easily. So if the policy limits to uniformity one of them will disappear in the future. In my opinion the government has to encourage people learn and speak these two languages. Finally we can anticipate that more and more people can speak Mandarin Chinese and Taiwanese.
