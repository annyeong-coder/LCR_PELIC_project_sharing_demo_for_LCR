In his talk Before Avatar . . . A curious boy James Cameron describes three lessons he has learned in his career. The first lesson is being curios. He explains how in his childhood he used to play with frogs and snakes looking at them under the microscope. It was all about trying to understand the world understand the limits of possibility he says. The film maker explains how his curiosity conducted him to read Jacques Cousteau and how Cousteau books inspired him to be a scuba diver and to find in the oceans different kinds of ideas for his films. The second lesson is to think on imagination as a force that can manifests a reality. That he said seemed to be the best way to reconcile the urge he had to tell stories with his urges to create images. Cameron thinks that he owns the success of movies as Terminator Aliens Titanic and The Abyss to the mix of curiosity and imagination he had. The director also says that Arthur Clarke's law any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic pushed him to bring it to cinematic art and the use of computer generated animation in Avatar is a sample of it. The third lesson is that the respect of his team is more important than all the laurels in the world. When he made his last movie Avatar he tried to apply a important principle of leadership that you respect your team and you earn their respect in return . Besides curiosity imagination and work in a team Cameron says that when young film makers come up to him and say Give me some advice for doing this he answers Don't put limitations on yourself. Other people will do that for you don't do it to yourself don't bet against yourself. And take risks.
