I went to Atlanta with ELI students and teachers. First day we went to the Georgia Aquarium which is the biggest in the world. I anticipated that I might be threatened by its big size but it was not big than I thought. I even heard from someone the Pittsburgh Aquarium is better than Georgia's. However unexpectedly 4D animation accessible to people paying an additional fee was cute and fun. At second day we went to CNN and Coca Coke headquarters. During CNN group tour we tried not to interrupt the people who were working in office. The Coca Coke center gave tourists a chance to taste 64 flavors of beverage generated by Coca Coke Company. It was very enjoyable experience.
