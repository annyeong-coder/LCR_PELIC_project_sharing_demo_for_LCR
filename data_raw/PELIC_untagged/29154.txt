Many issues are universally taken place nowadays and banning Muslim women from wearing hijab at schools in some countries is one of them. The opponent for wearing hijab said it was kind of discrimination among citizens because you can recognize Muslim women from their hijab. The other believes that wearing hijab is not fair on women because it might be an obstacle in their life. Although all these ideas I believe that hijab should not be banned in schools for any reason. First each woman in this world has her own right to choose which religion she believes in and how to express that. In addition there is a discrimination among people in their colors as well as races. Second wearing hijab gives women more respect and value. Moreover many Christian and Jewish women cover their hair and they did not criticize by other people or media.
