When I become the president I'll impose an arbitrary tax policy. If Matt Cassel can throw long passes Randy Moss will demonstrate his radical play style. Unless I get a jackpot with lottery I won't be rich. The ESPN's announcer said that in case the Redskins lost the Monday night game the senate Obama would win the election. Because keeping animals is prohibited by my apartment's policy I'll keep crayfish or turtles. After the senate Obama wins the election America will have the first black president. As soon as I take the NFL channel service I will start a life as being a couch potato. Once you see a ghost you'll believe the paranormal phenomenon. Before you have a baby you will need to marry. Although he is rich he will be reluctant to treat dinner.
