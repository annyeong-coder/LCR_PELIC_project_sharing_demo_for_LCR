Some people think Friday and Sunday is same for them some people don't. For me I think Friday is different from Sunday even though Friday and Sunday is all called weekend. They still have something different such as I still need to go to school or work on Friday but I have a day off on Sunday. Friday I have classes in the morning and afternoon but I can stay outside or friends' houses late. I don't need to worry about can I wake up early in the morning. Also I can feel relaxed to anticipate in all activities on Friday night. It's not neccesary to worry about next day because I don't have class on Saturday. Sunday I don't have any classes so I can do everything I want to do. I can hangout with my friends clean my room do my laundry go shopping or do my homework. . . Etc. I can do a lot of things on Sunday however I can't stay late at outside. Sunday's next day is Monday. I have classes on Monday. If I stay outside too late on Sunday I can't wake up in the morning on Monday. I will attribute all of this on Sunday night. Friday and Sunday is also weekend but they have some inherent different. I can go out at night on Friday but I can't do this on Friday. I can have a totally day off on Sunday but I don't have this on Friday. Are they same I think yes all of them are weekend. Are they different For me they are different. They have different functions so Fiday is different from Sunday.
