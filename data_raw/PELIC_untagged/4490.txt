What is Memorial Day Memorial Day is one of the important days which commemorate fallen soldiers who fought in the war. In general American people go to the cemetery and hang the American flog in front of the house. I didn't notice differences between general weekend and Memorial Day even though Yesterday I went to some store to buy grocery foods and then went to the park to play tennis. The reason why I didn't notice is that I didn't pay attention environment of Memorial Day. Also I didn't know about Memorial Day. So I would see differences in Memorial Day to know American histories next year.
