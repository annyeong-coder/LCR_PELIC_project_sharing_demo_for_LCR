There are several things I am thinking about lately. I am craving a dish made by my mom. She is a good cook I actually think that she is the best cook ever. There is one problem with her food that she sometimes uses too much salt. She is 70 years old and I always tell her to be careful to use little oil and less sugar and salt. Ramadan is coming soon and it is considered to be a holy month for Muslims. Three weeks ago I booked a flight to home country on the 7th of August. Fasting Ramadan in a none Muslim country can be a challenge. Unfortunately I injured my knee two weeks ago and now I am worried about my flight to home with not being able to fully bend my knee. I am certain that I will have a beautiful time with my family. I should get an academic acceptance for a PhD program before leaving to home. Many schools have different admission criteria. Awainting for acceptance can lead to a lot of stress.
