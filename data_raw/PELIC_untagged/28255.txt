My family have changed since 2005 When they moved to Riyadh and my brother was graduate from the university. My father was soldier in saudi army then he retired. I was study in secondary school and my little brothers also. My mother has taught english for long time. And our house was very small But now we have a big palace. Also my uncle has lived for long time with us.
