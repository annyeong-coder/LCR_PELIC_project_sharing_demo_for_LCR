I have thought being on diet. I have known that it is hard way for all people since I firstly tried it last year. There are logically two ways for losing one's weight. One way is decrease our meal and another way is consuming the calories with exercise. Six weeks have passed since I came to America. First 2 weeks I couldn't have reduced the amount of meal because of eating American food at restaurant but I had walked for long distance because I had not have Pitts ID. Controversially after I get my Pitts ID I have reduced my exercise because of using bus every day. And instead of this I bought some cooking tool and I got to make the healthy meal by myself. So I can have have been able to reduced the calories of the meals. Certainly it is the best way to try the two ways at the same time. Although I have not been able to do so I have fortunately succeeded to lose 3kg of my weight.
