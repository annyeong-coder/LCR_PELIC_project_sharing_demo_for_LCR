I was in New York state when I thought to move to Pennsylvania state. I was puzzled about making a decision to transfer between two institutes the ELS at Point Park University and the ELI at the University of pittsburgh . Although I got some information from my friends who had studied in both institutes my decision was difficult. After I analyzed the similarities and differences between the two schools I saw that the ELI was the best choice. There are many things between common in both schools. First the students are from all over the world. That helps me to learn a lot of information about their cultures. Second in both places there are many interesting activities such as recreational trips visiting historical places and festivities. Finally both schools are located in a convenient place in the City of pittsburgh. In fact when I looked at the similarities it seems to me they are not important factors in my decision. First of all the most important things for me are the quality of education the cost and the advantage. The ELS does not have as good a quality of education as the ELI. The study program is monthly courses. On the other hand the ELI has a semester course and I like it. In addition I can continue and complete my major academic study in the University of pittsburgh. Although I'm a student and I have scholarships I would like to know how much my country has to pay. I find the ELS more expensive than the ELI compared to the duration of study. Finally the ELS have limited advantages. In contrast the ELI has many advantages for us as new international student such as public transportation print and copy services and a large library. All of these are free. In conclusion my decision was easier after taking everything into consideration. A high quality of education a lot of advantages and a suitable cost are all very important to me. Therefore I decided to register in the ELI.
