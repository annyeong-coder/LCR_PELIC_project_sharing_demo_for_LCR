Architecture There are different architectures in the world such as churches skyscrapers houses and apartments. First of all my favorite architecture is church. I hope I can see the majestic church in Pittsburgh. Second the skyscrapers are popular in Taipei. Although I lived in modern city I prefer to live in small town. There are some reasons why I don't like to live in the city. First there is too much air pollution in the city. Second there are too many cars parked on the streets. Third to make matters worse there are not enough parking places. In Pittsburgh the house stands on a hill. There is heavy snow in winter. The house has a peaked roof if the roof is flat the snow is too heavy on the roof and will collapse and people could get hurt. I also like garden in front of my house. We have tomatoes day lily basil and roses plant in garden. It is very beautiful and has fun. The house is just as convenient as the apartment. Finally nice architectures have to be accompanied by beautiful flowers.
