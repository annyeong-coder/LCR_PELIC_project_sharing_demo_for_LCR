The full name of the ELI is English Language Institute which is a wonderful place to learn English. All teachers here are so nice and helpful that you can ask them for help about anything. Teachers will help everyone to solve their problem patiently. Students in ELI are from different countries half of them come from Arabic and some of them come from Asia. In addition students in the ELI are different age. They generally fall into two groups some of them are students who want to improve English so that they can attend university some of them are adults who want to find a better job in their country. I love the ELI because the teachers are friendly classmates are easygoing and the most important is that I can improve my English here.
