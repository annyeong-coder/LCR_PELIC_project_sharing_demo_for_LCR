There are many beautiful places in my country. Usually I visit them in my free time. In the summer I go to the beach. Libya has a long beautiful beach. There are a lot of cities near the beach. There is one capital city near the beach. It's named Tripoli. And there are many historic cities near this beach for example Sabrata Lobda and Oya. There are old big buildings in Sabrata. There are a lot of tourists who visit this cities every year.
