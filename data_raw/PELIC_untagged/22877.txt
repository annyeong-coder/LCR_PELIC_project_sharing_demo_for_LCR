In 2009 I was in high school I used to sleep early. I did'n use to make my hair long but my friend he used to make his hair long. Also I used to sleep early it's was really good. Even in weekend I used to wake up early that make me feel healthy. In high school I used to have fun a lot but now in college I have many responsibility. Life it's not fear but you can make different in your life if you used to study hard.
