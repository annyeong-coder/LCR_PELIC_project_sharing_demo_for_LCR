If I had been born a man I would be stronger and less sensitive but I definitely could have never been a mom. In addition If I had not been a woman I would have never been married to my husband and I might have never met him. Moreover if I had been born a boy I would have never worn a skirt or scarf. To conclude If I had been born a man I could have never enjoyed being a woman.
