Hi I'm Lily Last Name . I've been living in U. S. Since 2005. I built this website to introduce myself here. I grew up in Taipei in Taiwan and my father was a general contract. Therefore I have worked in the constructions field since I graduated from college. Lately America economy has been collapsing so my company closed 6 months ago. That's why I'm in Pittsburgh to studying English. I've been studying English as a second language for five weeks but I still take time out to play. Since I traveled to Seoul in Korea I've been interested in skiing. Last week I've already learned how to ski. Yes while I was practicing I've been fell down many times. Even though I haven't been skiing for a long time actually only twice but skiing became my new hobby.
