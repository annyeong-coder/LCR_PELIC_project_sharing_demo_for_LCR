I was going to the school last morning at 9 o'clock. I was hit by a young lady. That lady scared and disappeared. I was taken to the hospital by me teacher. The lady was found in one the parks there. My teacher was rewarded by the police department. My parents were asked to thank him. Today I am being cared to my house in a good condition.
