I have three suggestions for a student who will take Writing 4 in the future. First of all do not be absent in any class. Teacher sometimes gives you in class practices to writing a paragraph. If you are absent on that day it is hard to make up. Second do not think too much. The structure of English writing is very clear and organized. When you started to write just followed the outline steps which teacher taught you it can help you focus on your main idea. Finally the most principal suggestion is to review different writing patterns frequently. Even you know many kinds of writing skills or patterns you still have to review and remember them to demonstrate in your essay. If you can keep these suggestions in your mind you will learn very well in Writing 4.
