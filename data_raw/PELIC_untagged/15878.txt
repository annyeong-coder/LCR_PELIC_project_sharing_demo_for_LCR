MY wife told me not to pick the phone up. It's probably a telemarketer. She did not want to let me answer the phone but I finally managed to talk her into it. Then I picked up the phone the telemarketer as my wife expected asked ''How are you today 'after that he told about the offer which his company has. He wanted me to sign up in as a new custmer. My wife told me the breakfast is ready so I must hanged up the phone. I told the telemarketer I'm busy right now but if you give me your phone number so I can call you back later. He told me sure here it is.
