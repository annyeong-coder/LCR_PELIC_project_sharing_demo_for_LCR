Bundang in which I spend time growing up is near Seoul which is the capital of Korea. I have lived in Bundang over past 9 years. Bundang where is one of the city of education in Korea consists of a lot of people who come from another city for educating their childen. My parents whom both wanted me to study in Budang also came from another city where is Seoul. I studied there from elementary school to high school. Bundang has two well known park. One of them is called the Celtral Park and another is called the Yuldong Park. Most of the students who are living in Bundang might spend time making an excursion to either of them. Bundang has been developed after I came there. The village where is in Bundang and called ANON_NAME_0 ja have been developed for making a city of high quality especially after I came to Bundang because residents wanted their city to be like Seoul.
