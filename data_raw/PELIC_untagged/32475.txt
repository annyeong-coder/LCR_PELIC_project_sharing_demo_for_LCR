Never will I forget the life in the military. Controlling a group of diverse people in the troop they treat soldiers harshly with very strict rules. As one can imagine without proper mechanism of managing people every schedule becomes very ineffective everyone becomes resistant in their mind. Poor schedule makes everyone extremely exhausted every day. Therefore accident happened unfortunately to me at the fourth month of my service. Having unreasonable multiple duties in the troop I had to stand guard at 4 a. M. With 3 hour sleep continuing almost one week. Actually being a corporal I wasn't really standing there and guarding the door. Not only did I have to pay attention to all situations in the barrack but also supervising the guarding soldier was my job. Under this circumstance tragedy happened. At 6 a. M. In the morning 10 minutes before my time to sleep I led a soldier to examine his rifle which is a routine before switching guard. Tired and absent minded my soldier didn't follow my command completely. Extremely tired I didn't notice what he was doing. Never would I imagine that he triggered the rifle in front of me and the sound was heard by everybody. Shocked and furious battery commander shouted at us and reported to the higher department. Waiting for the punishment our weekly break was taken away. Considered as guilty people not only our benefits but also our duties were taken away. What we could do at that time was doing trivial things such as cleaning floors washing dishes or cleaning the restrooms. Ineffectively we were sent to a military police company and grounded after 2 months. What I needed to do in the confinement cell was trivial. Without duties and responsibilities I could sleep on time and get a huge amount of physical exercise. Whether you believe or not doesn't change the fact that the time I was waiting for the punishment and the time I was grounded was the best and easiest time in the military.
