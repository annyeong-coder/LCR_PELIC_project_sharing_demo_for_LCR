Well this is not a single situation but It is really funny. I have a pet her name is Laura. What is funny about this is that she has issues psychological issues. The first time that she come to my house she didn't respond to her name . Why was that . Well this poor girl was thrown from the two houses where she lived because she was a conflict dog. Of course she didn't know which one was her mane because they changed several time. The fact is that now she does funny and amazing things. For example I moved from my parent house and I didn't bring her with me because I thought that she would be better in a pace with yard instead that in my apartment. After one week my sister called me and told me hey your dog is weird or stupid but actually she jumped from the roof to our neighbor s house. I remembered that at first I was scared but when I knew that she was perfect I was surprised. The doctor said to me that it could be two options. The first one is that she was so depress because I left that she tried to kill herself or that she was trying to escape and she thought that the roof was a nice idea and my neighbor are still talking about this crazy depress dog who tried to kill herself. I really do not know why she always has crazy ideas to resolve her problems. Now her doctor told me that she is extremely fat and she is acting weird probably because I am not there and she decide to eat to resolve her new abandoned issue. . . May be I should take her to an animal psychiatrist but she is like a human so I just can love her as she is.
