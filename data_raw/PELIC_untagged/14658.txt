Since I graduated at University I decided to study English. This reason I've come to USA. My sister recommend come to Pittsburgh so I've come here. However I think I could have searched another city for study. Also previous I think I should have studied about grammar. Because If I studied grammar before came to USA it might easier to understand. Actually I shouldn't have studied hard about grammar. So I think I ought to have studied grammar. Also I might have prepared for Pittsburgh Winter. Because I heard snow will be often during Winter. So I should have brought some of warm clothes. However I'm ready to enjoy Pittsburgh snow even though I don't like cold weather.
