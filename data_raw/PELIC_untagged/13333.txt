Hi! My name is Student's Name . Im from Japan. Student's First Name is a common name in Japan. I know it is difficult to pronounce for other countrys people so Im always telling people how to pronounce my name. The trick is sour and e. In Japan I worked at a book store because I like reading books. Im also writing a novel now.
