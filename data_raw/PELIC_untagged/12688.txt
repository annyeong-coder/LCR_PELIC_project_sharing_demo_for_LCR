Qualities of a good neighbor For me a good neighbor is a person that I never notice his presence. I'm very individualist and I hate when neighbors gossip about my live that is why I prefer to live my own live and have the less contact as possible with the neighbors. In this matter some characteristics are very important for a good relationship been organized and quiet are some of them. There are many characteristic that involves been organized and been clean is one of them. Keeping their littering in the right place being careful with the common areas of the building and keeping the cigarette buds in the ashtrays and not in the entrance floor are important characteristic for a good relation with me. This way I will not notice his presence and be comfortable. The most important characteristic of a good neighbor is been quiet I hate when I can hear my neighbor's fight or when I hear them walking or moving things around the apartment but the worst thing is when I hear their loud music. I am a really calm person and when I am at home a need peace to relax and do my own things. That is why I hate loud noise. In conclusion for me a good neighbor should be a person that doesn't bothers me that stay in his place and lives his own life I don't like to notice my neighbor's presence and for this happen he needs to be clean organized and the most important characteristic been quiet.
