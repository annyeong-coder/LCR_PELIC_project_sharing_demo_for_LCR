I have already planned the party tonight and I have already talked with my friend Peter and he is helping me. I have already cleaned the house but I haven't washes the windows yet. I have already called the people for the party but I haven't asked permission to the neighbour yet. I have already brought the tables but I haven't brought chairs yet. I have already bought the glasses plates and serviettes but I haven't bought fork spoon and knife yet. I have already tablecloth but I haven't bought flowers yet. My friend Peter has already bought the soda drink and water but he hasn't bought the chips yet. He has already made the chicken but he hasn't made the cake yet. I have already made omelette buy I haven't made pasta yet. I have already brought hi fi but I haven't brought the music yet.
