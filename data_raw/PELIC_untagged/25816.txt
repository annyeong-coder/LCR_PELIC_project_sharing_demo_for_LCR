When I was 10 years old I couldn't play soccer but now I can. Everyday I couldn't join my friends to play in the school stadium but now I can join them. I couldn't visit my friends because they was very far from my house. I couldn't drive to my school but now I can. The most important thing that I could study too much but now I can't.
