Genetic Engineering support Many people against genetic engineering because they are concerned that the genetic engineering would lead to unpredictable outcomes or side effects. But I believe that if we do it with carefully plan and make it under control the genetic engineering will benefit our life in different fields such as the medical agricultural pharmaceutical etc. 1 Benefits the medical Producing organs for medical transplants 2 Benefits agricultural increasing the production of crops resisting to pests 3 Benefits pharmaceutical making insulin producing antibiotics Genetic Engineering against Many people think genetic engineering can benefit our life in different fields such as the medical agricultural pharmaceutical. But I believe that the genetic engineering would lead to unpredictable outcomes or side effects under our current techniques. We should limited the genetic engineering is some fields. 1 Risk of misuse we have not understood the function of whole genes yet any changes of genes or genetic engineering may cause unpredictable problems. 2 Harmful effects on crops some modified genes could hurt other biology 3 genetic modified animals have deficits at birth and die while they are still young
