I disagree about this topic. Sometimes I heard someone had good luck near by me. For example my friend didn't prepare presenting at interview. She got a question that she have ever seen on the newspaper. So she could answer easily. And she could get into the company. Someone can tell me it was not lucky just she prepared in her life. I now It's not only lucky. But if she got another question can she answer like that and other case sometimes who don't have enough score but they got the company or school. I don't wait the luck. If someone is waiting only lucky it's very stupid. I believe good luck has something to do with success. In addition it can help success.
