Twelve years ago my husband and I went on honeymoon to Maldives. We stayed at the Poison resort for 4 days. First day of the Poison resort it rained all day. So we went resort's teahouse to drink coffee and tea. We spent much time there. Next day we snorkeled in the sea. There were many kinds of color fish like blue pink yellow and red fish. Also we cloud see beautiful coral reefs in the sea. It was a wonderful view. On the last day of trip we visited at Male. It was a small city. We had a good time in Maldives. This was a trip I never forgot.
