Regarding his research I don't think his idea is more reasonable because people have different scaling for a good natural smell. Maybe it's one of the factors that will attract on the both sides at the first date's moment if they are still don't have acceptation. But I think it doesn't have attract if they are already accepting gather through first look more than smell and maybe that if they don't have life experience will let them fall in the love then that issue will be ignore and wont affect on the relationship. By the way now everything is easy to appear perfect but in the actual is a fake. Then the other factors like smile and eyes and body language have more attractive than a good natural smell.
