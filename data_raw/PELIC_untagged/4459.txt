It requires several steps to plan for a weekend trip to another city. First of all you should choose a city what you want. Some people refer to the Internet and others ask to friends. I usually ask to my friends because it is believable. Next you should reserve a hotel. If you using the Internet you will get some cheap hotels and also the web site provides a lot of reviews about the hotel. In addition I suggest you get a map from your city to there. I usually get a map at the AAA office or at the Google. Finally if you prepare some food for during driving it will be perfect trip.
