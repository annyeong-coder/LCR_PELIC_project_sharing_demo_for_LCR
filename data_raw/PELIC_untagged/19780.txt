In my opinion the Internet is not good and safe place to meet a romantic partner because people usually tell a lot of lies in the Internet. For example they use the photos that they don't look like their real views. While they tell about themselves they usually exaggerate. Of course everyone wants to a romantic relationship but you must do some important things for this. If you level each other romantic relationship can be starting. Sometime you feel like someone but this situation doesn't prove that this person can be your romantic partner. Finally the Internet is not a good place to meet a romantic partner because if you can not touch and hear his her real voice you don't find to your romantic partner.
