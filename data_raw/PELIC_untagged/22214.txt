Yes because nonhuman primates are able to use sign language as well as human primates. In the reading materials the ability of non human primates to use signs languages have been proven by mentioning their ability to use American Sign Language ASL . For example the reading passage mentioned that Washoe and Lucy female chimpanzees were able to acquire more than 100 signs language representing English words. In the video a gorilla called Koko has proven her ability to use signs language by acquiring 200 signs. For example Koko were able to reveal her emotions such as her eating appetite crying distress and sadness using signs language. To sum up there is no difference between human and non human primates in terms of using signs language but the difference is in using verbal language which is only exclusive to human primates.
