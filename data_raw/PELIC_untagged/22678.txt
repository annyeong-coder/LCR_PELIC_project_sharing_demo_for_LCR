My room is small and messy. When you open my door you will see my bed on your right close to wall. In front of you my clothes in the rack impede me if I want go out. In the corner are the desk and the chair I study in. My clothes are everywhere in my room on the desk and on the bed. When I see it I feel nerves. But the best thing in my room is the window. I can see a wonderful view. I spend all my time outside of my room to be happy
