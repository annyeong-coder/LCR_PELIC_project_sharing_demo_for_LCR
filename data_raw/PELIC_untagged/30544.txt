Variety is the main reason why I like nontraditional lifestyle. As we know it is necessary to improve any society. In contrast traditional lifestyle is a kind of ISOLATED area. They have common behavioer and they know poorly about other cultures. In addition strangers might be REJECTED in this type of lifestyle. In modern lifestyle it is possibl that someone not from the area PARTICIPATING and being an important member in this group. Modern lifestyle does not care about people it cares about what people offer to their society. What DISTURBS people about this way of life is the overcrowded and the huge number of transportaion. But even though these advantages it is still my best lifestyle.
