Yesterday I went downtown by myself. I wanted to see how Pittsburgh is changed because of G 20. Downtown was not crowed. I think many citizens decided not to go out. It might be dangerous. Someone offered to join a concert at Point park. It seemed to be fun. When I arrived I was surprised at coming of many people. Some people convinced government to make more many jobs and good policy of education. And some people urged other people to be concerned about global warming. Some people who is likely to be press and camera man interviewed citizen and visitor. I think they don't want to use of violence. But many police blocked them. I think Pittsburgh make citizen have a fright about G 20.
