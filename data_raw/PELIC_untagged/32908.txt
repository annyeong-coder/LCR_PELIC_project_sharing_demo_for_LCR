My name is Sooyi Kang. I am from South Korea. Now I am writing information about me to introduce myself at mac lab. My major is Viola. I have played the viola since I was 13 years old. I like listening classical music. Every summer vacation I go to wind surfing I go to ski in winter vacation. I came to Pittsburgh 2 years ago. I studied at CMU as a violist. I would like to study more I decided to start master's program. I'm planning to start master's program after this summer. To start master's program I think I need to study English. That is why I'm studying English at ELI during the summer vacation. I'm hoping ELI helps me to improve my English and I will also work hard!
