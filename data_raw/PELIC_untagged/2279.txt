I've main habits for writing and I sure each one has different habits depend. In fact some of my habits are changed by my mood. In general I like to study in the clean area. For example I study after I reorganize my room books and notes. Then I prepare some coffee with cookies and cakes. Usually I turn on the TV or listen to my favorite's music. I like to stud in the cool temperature. For example I study when the ac works but it isn't at this time! The bright light is the type of light I like for studying because I usually study on my bed. I use many tools when I study. For example I use a pencil notebook and computer. But I don't use some tools like highlighters. Always I take break time to refresh my mind. For example I browse the internet for a while I'm resting about twenty minutes. Sometimes I close my eyes and go a far. I like to study with simple clothes on. For instance I like the pajama or short wear. In my secondary school I used to study individually. But now I prefer to study with my friends. Finally I try to improve my writing skills via enchainment my habits through this course with our great teacher.
