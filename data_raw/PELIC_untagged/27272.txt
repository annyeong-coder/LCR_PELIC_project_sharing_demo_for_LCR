I was born in Medina where I grew up. I remember the park which was next to our house. My Friends and I usually met there every weekends. I remember myself sliding on the slide swinging and playing games like hide and seek. It is said that I was pampered since I am the smallest daughter and because I was taken great care by my mother due to my father's death. I remember my mother sitting besides me reading good night stories and teaching me the Arabic alphabet.
