After I finish the summer semester at the ELI I am going to study toefl. I won't have plan for travel anywhere because I am going to study for toefl and Gmat. I am going to plan for studying next semester and I will estimate time to take a test. While I am studying I will fine some plan for relax with my husband. After I take a test I will go eat out. Before next semester will star I must reread of last semester.
