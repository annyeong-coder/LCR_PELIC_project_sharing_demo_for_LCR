Well I wish I could make comment about San Francisco but I've never been there so I dont have any idea about it. On the other hand I've been in Pittsburgh approximately for 6 months. Let me tell you some prencipal things about Pittsburgh that could captivate you. This is the city where is really quiet safe and secure. Moreover it is the city that has the least criminal rate in the US. Yes the one that you heard about the weather is terribly true. This city has substantially inconsistent weather. Whereas it could be unbearably hot you migh always have to carry your umbrella in your bag in case raining. However I think it doesn't affect you to not to come here after you learn that Pittsburgh is named twice America's Most Livable City and likewise one of the magazine has put Pittsburgh atop the list of American cities for its quality of life. I hope you got some ideas from the advice that I gave you based on my experiences. Thank you for your asking
