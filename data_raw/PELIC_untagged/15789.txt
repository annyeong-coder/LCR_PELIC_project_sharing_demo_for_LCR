There is a limit to the Earth's resources. We will cause exhaustion of resources if we continue using the resources. We must ensure effective utilization of limited resources. To that end we have to learn of recycling method. The three most commonly proposed solutions to these Earth's resources problem are garbage reduction carrying around eco friendly goods and setting trash bin by category. The first solution is garbage reduction. We have to reduce as much as possible of the trash. For instance we have to pay when take out the garbage. In doing so we may stop wasting consumable goods such as tissues and paper dishes. Also when we buy merchandise we may carefully examine merchandise to check whether really necessary. This solution is taking good care of Earth's resources. Another solution is carrying around eco friendly goods. For example when we go shopping we use eco bag and we refine from using plastic bags. As a result the amount of garbage has also been dramatically reduced. Also the most of Japanese supermarkets we have to pay money for plastic bags. According to the Japanese government since the introduction of system the number of plastic bags used has decreased by 60 percent. The best solution is setting trash bin by category. We have to separate the garbage. More specifically it is increase the use of renewable Earth's resources. For example paper pet bottles and aluminum cans can be recycled. We may save earth's resources by separating recycling from not recyclable trash. Cyclical use of resources is the most important solution. As a conclusion our life styles rely on mass production mass consumption and mass disposal. There will be depletion of the Earth's natural resources. We have to bequeath a beautiful environment and valuable resources to subsequent generations. Therefore we must lead environmental lifestyles. We need to incorporate into daily life.
