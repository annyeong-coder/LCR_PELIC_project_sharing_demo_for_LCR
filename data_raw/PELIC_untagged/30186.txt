I am going to write about the invention of computer in our life. Some people think that computer makes our life more stressful and complex other say that invention of computer makes our life easier and convenient. I agree with people who say that computer makes our life easier and convenient for many reasons. First computer can calculate and analyze data in short time as result we will save our time. Then people can communicate with family and friends in the easiest and cheapest way through access to internet. Finally computer stores data and information in less space as result we don't need papers.
