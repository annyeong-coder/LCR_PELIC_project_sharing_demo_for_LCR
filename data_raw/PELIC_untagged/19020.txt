If I have enough money and time I will go to Greece. Because When I saw Mammamia I thought if I go there it will be great. Because I heard it has a nice view and delicious seafood. I really want to enjoy the travel. If I go there first I will go to the place that the background of Mammamia. Second I will eat sea food. Because actually I love sea food but I do not have many chance to eat fresh sea food in US. And I will seep the hotel that background of Mammamia. Last of all I will go to Sontorinia. I think there is the most popular island in Greece. I watch on TV. Is't view is really great. As a result I want to go to Greece.
