I had an enjoyable time last weekends. I went to the Philadelphia with my daddy on Saturday. My daddy's friend Mr. Nam lives in Ambler near the Philadelphia. We rent a car and my daddy drove it. Mr. Nam invited us. His wife prepared a fancy dinner for us. For example we ate teriyaki beef and organic vegetable with wine. I loved it. Next day my daddy and I took train SEPTA we went to the Independent Hall in downtown of Philadelphia. In addition I saw the Liberty Bells. It has a lot of symbols such as freedom democracy and women's liberty etc. I thought it is a representative thing in the U. S. Also I went to the University of Pennsylvania. It is bigger than University of Pittsburgh. The University of Pennsylvania is known for Korean well so I felt intimate there. I took many photos I ate tacos at the Union of Students. On Memorial Day I went to the Longwood Garden in Kennett Square. There are several plants and flowers. There is really broad I should walk and walk. Especially I enjoyed a conservatory and fountains. They made me be delightful. I bought some souvenir a cactus potpourris for my friend and me. During last weekends I was really fun in Philadelphia.
