My name is Hernan Last Name . I was born in Bucaramanga Colombia. Let me tell about some relevant aspects of my profession. I studied philosophy. When I had studied philosophy at Santo Tomas University I decided to explore some essential factors about ancient philosophy. I had read some interesting interpretations about philosophers like Parmenides Heraclitus Plato Aristotle Epicuro etc. Now I have been reading an outstanding interpretation about Marcus Aurelius. When I moved to Pittsburgh I had been searching about Aristotle's biology. Now I have been searching about Stoicism. By 2005 I had written an article about Epicurus and Plato. This year I began to write an article about Marcus Aurelius. I have written about the relations between writing and spiritual exercises. I think that some American resources will be very important for my article. Also I had rethought some crucial elements about the Plato's works. For instance I had been working about the relation between drama and philosophy in the Plato's dialogues. These are some subjects that I had been working when I decided to move to Pittsburgh.
