I agree with women are better parents than men. Women can be more patient than men. For example when women give a birth they have to stuck with painful for many hours. According to the above paragraph the reason demonstrate women can be more patient and powerful at the same time. Obviously some women can be able to wait somebody without arguing. To illustrate if women pick their kids up at school they are please to wait for their kids without any accuses. Another reson most of women have a strong minded. They can make final decision when anybody wants. For instant when men want to make a decision they ask their wife to help them. This point shows that women can be a better parents than men because they are poweful and gentle simultaneuosly.
