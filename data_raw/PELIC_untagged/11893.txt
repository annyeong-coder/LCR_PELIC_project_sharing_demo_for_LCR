Scientists have calculated that 97. 5 Out of all water supplies on our planet are found in salty seas and oceans. That means that the supply of clean water makes 2. 5 Of the entire water supply. Taking into consideration that 75 of the clean water supplies are frozen in the mountains and polar caps another 24 are located in the form of subsoil waters and 0. 5 Are found in the moist soil then the easiest source of available clean water resources which are rivers lakes and other reservoirs make up 0. 01 Of all water supply. The above statistics one more time confirm that water is one of the most precious treasures of our planet. Water at first sight the elementary chemical compound of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen is without any exaggeration a basis of a life on the Earth. Scientists in searches of forms of a life on other planets of solar system direct so much effort on detection of traces of water. In itself water has no nutritional value but it is an indispensable component of all alive. One of the main reasons of water pollutions are oil and mineral oil. Oil can get in water as a result of its natural outputs in areas. But the basic sources of pollution are connected with human activity oil extracting transportation processing and use of oil as fuel and industrial raw material. They find more and more wide application in the industry on transport and in a household facility. We can preserve the natural resources of clean water by economizing the use decreasing pollution and generating new technologies for purification of salty waters. The steady practice of water resources management is necessary to the world. The Chinese proverb says If we shall not change our direction we will come where we are going .
