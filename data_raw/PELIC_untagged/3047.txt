Dear Mr. ANON_NAME_0 I am a student at the EFL Computer Training Institute. My classes are very good but I think there ara some problems you should know them. First I think you should come to look at A 19 at the EFL. It's dirty and remiss. Students eat and drink in the classroom. They sould empty the trash. Most of the materials are broken and out of order. I think you should improve it. Seconed there is not more than one computer and students can't work in this situation. I think you'd better find the way to improve the institute. Lastly I'm sorry you receive and read letter like this. Thanks ANON_NAME_1
