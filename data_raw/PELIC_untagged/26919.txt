I lived in Pittsburgh ten month ago. I have been studying English since Oct 2009. I have had driver's license for five month. After that I bought my car. I have driven since june 2010. When I took it I visited some place in Pittsburgh. There are many theater in Pittsburgh. I have been going the cinema because I like it. I like to go with my friends but sometime my friends are beasy.
