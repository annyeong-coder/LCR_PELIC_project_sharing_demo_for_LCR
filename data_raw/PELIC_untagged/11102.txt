When I got to the United State my life became different . In Pittsburgh I usually get up early but in my country I got up late . Three months ago I had a job but now I have classes . I became a student and I have many tests and quizzes but before I had too much work in my job. In Pittsburgh I always go back home at 4 00 in the afternoon but in my country I went back home at 2 30 in the afternoon . Also in my country I visited my big family my uncles and my aunts but here I don't have family I just have some friends. Sometimes I visit my friends and they visit me . So my life changed completely.
