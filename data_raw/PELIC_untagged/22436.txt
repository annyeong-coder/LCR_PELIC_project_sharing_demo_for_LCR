I have several experiences that seem to be ideal parents. My father was a person who was very honest and generous to his children especially to me. My mother was very quiet and never scolded me for being lazy that I didn't do any household chores while I was studying hard. Both of them showed me their way of life which was positive and ever onward. Our only daughter whose name is Yuko grew up watching our way of life too. My husband who was a very busy office worker always tried to listen to her talking that was about her friend teacher or her course to be taken etc. Even if he had less sleeping time. One thing I could do for her as an ideal parent was that I cooked handmade dishes for every meal and made her clothing by myself. Now she has two children whom she starts to let do a little housework. She spends much time in the park where they can meet many friends which I couldn't do due to taking care of my mother. When she asks me a piece of advice about parenting I can tell her my opinion which is an objective view point I could never do for her.
