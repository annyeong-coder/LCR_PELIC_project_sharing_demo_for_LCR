When I was a high school student my mom made me learn Chinese because learning another language can be useful for the future. However I wanted to learn Japanese more than Chinese so I had my dad persuade my mom to let me learn Japanese. After she talked with him she let me learn Japanese. I needed a Japanese tutor so she had me look for tutor. I had no idea because I had never seen Japanese speaker before. So I decided to ask at the online. Fortunately someone who interested in Japanese helped me to find a tutor.
