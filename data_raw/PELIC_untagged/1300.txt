Nowadays in Saudi Arabia we are facing a big problem in the sewage system. Since we don't have a sewage system. However actually the government has moved to solve this problem three years ago. But since that time we haven't seen any development in the case. In the old days 20 years ago they started to work on the sewage system but they stopped the project because they discovered a scandal between the contractors that have been working on the project and a mayor of one of the cities. Nevertheless they started the project again but under intensive monitoring. I hope about the time I get back to my country the project well completed.
