At the beginning of my English learning process my pronunciation and my grammar skills were limited. It was in June 2009 when I came to U. S. To New York City NYC more exactly. Nonetheless NYC is a cosmopolitan city with plenty Spanish speaker people I had troubles trying to express myself on streets and stores. I think my strong accent avoided a better understanding between myself and native English speakers. Moreover my grammar was a quite basic resume taken off my high school English classes furthermore I did funny mistakes that showed my foreign condition. The more disappointed issue was the fact that trying of using my English the person with whom I was trying to communicate recognized my Spanish background and responded me in Spanish. Most of them were Latin Americans. That happened multiple times at restaurants and stores. I was at this time when I realized that I needed a advanced English course. The fact of have a limited English knowledge made me eating a lot spicy food.
