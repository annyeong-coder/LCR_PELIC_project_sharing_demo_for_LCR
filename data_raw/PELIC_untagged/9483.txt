I think some of Dr. Schwartz's advices in this article are valuable. First of all I agree her idea do not disclose too much personal information. It is good for you to hide some of your information to protect yourself. You can leave some general information such as hobbies and special experiences and try to get more details for this general information. Do not put your private information in your online profile or you might be easy to get troubles or might be disturbed. In addition spending time getting to know someone is also a good advice for online dating. The only way to know or understand a person is to communicate more with him or her. If you find the person who has totally different hobbies opinions and belief from you or you find the person who might be strange you should not meet him or her. Making friends online is good for you to broaden your mind and interesting as well. However you should pay more attetion to avoid being in danger.
