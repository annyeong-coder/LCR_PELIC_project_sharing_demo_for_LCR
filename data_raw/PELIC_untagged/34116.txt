Today I brought back a lot of good memories that I had never forgotten. Abha where I grew up is a small city in the south of Saudi Arabia. My family moved there from Qari where I was born. I don't remember our first house but when I was seven we moved to the house that I grew up in. I have a very clear image of it. The house which my parents still live is on a main street in Abha. To me this was the best place in the world because I spent my childhood there and there are a lot of memorizes. I remember the day when we moved to the house and I remember all of my father friends. I loved dinnertime because the kitchen was always full of my family and some friends. I remember the time my parents enrolled me to the elementary school and there were many children in the school but it was a happy day when I enrolled to the school. The school was close to our house and I was go to the school on my feet. I don't never forget our house where I grew up because it is very important to me.
