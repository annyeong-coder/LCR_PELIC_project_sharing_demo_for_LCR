There is a man who called Larry Walters is interested in flying but doesn't like taking airplanes. He decided to use balloons to fly. He bought 45 balloons and eight tanks of helium and ties the balloons to garden chair and use the rope to immobilize the chair. A sunny day he asked his friend to come and let them cut the rope. Then his chair was beginning to climb and it was climbed very quickly. He took pictures and ate lunch at the flying chair. But it was too cold when his chair in the high altitude he used the air rifle to pop the balloons to let the chair go down. But he couldn't control the descend and his chair touched the power cables that causes a power cut in Los Angeles. But fortunately in the end he landed safely.
