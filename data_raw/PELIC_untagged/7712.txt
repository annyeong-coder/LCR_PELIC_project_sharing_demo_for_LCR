I like my kitchen My kitchen is small but it is very ability. On the left of the entrance it's my refrigerator. The washer basin is next to the refrigerator. The cooker is on the right of the entrance. The oil fan is above the cooker. There are many cabinets on the back wall. The dishwasher is under the cabinets. The microwave is over the cabinets. The cook table is between the cooker and the cabinets. A dinner table and four chairs are in the middle of the kitchen. In this kitchen I can cook very easy.
