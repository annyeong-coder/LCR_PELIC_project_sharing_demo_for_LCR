People all over the nation were shocked last week by the emergence of a hoax at Denver International airport. Two parents informed the police with their 6 year child kidnapping in a balloon. Being a trend nowadays Heenes the parents aimed to gain publicity show and are expected to face charges based on Jim Alderden Larimer County Sheriff who initially believed the family's story and whose investigators were ultimately convinced with the trick after pretending for a long time to believe the parents in a trial to entice them to be tested. Heenes justified that they wanted to get their own show. From my point of view people should not be so adaptable to any trend.
