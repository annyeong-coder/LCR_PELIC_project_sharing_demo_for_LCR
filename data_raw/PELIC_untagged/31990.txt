Time Capsule On October 4 2010 my classmates and I created a time capsule. We buried it under the oldest tree in Fusozaki Park in Japan. The capsule contains 5items. Each item tells something about the lives we live today. For example I put a few magazines that I read when I was a child basket shoes that I used it and peace a paper that is my 0 point score sheet of math because when I got this score I couldn't show my mother. Also a pictures that are my family and my class mates and last thing is some clothes that are I used to wear when I was a high school student. Thus I put several stuff that are memorable items for me we will dig up the time capsule 100years later.
