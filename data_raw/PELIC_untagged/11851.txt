Favorite Restaurant in Oakland My favorite restaurant in Oakland is Hammins Ways. Hammins Ways is a sports bar and restaurant at the same time. There are a few things I love about it is the food. First of all is my favorite meal is the southwest BQ Burger it comes with lettuce tomato onion and American cheese and the best thing in the burger is BQ souse and bacon but I don't eat bacon because in my religion it's forbidden. These are the things that come on the famous southwest BQ burger. So that is why Hammins ways is my favorite restaurant Oakland.
