I think It is better to take a position in a company. In my country many people tend to avoid going into business. Working the company have several advantages compared with business. At first a Business includes dangerous elements because they have to involve their responsibility if some people go into business. On the other hand Working the company is more safe than business. They can receive a salary from the director. This shows us that we don't have to be on our responsibility though a salary is not expensive. Second People who are working for the company have many times for spending with their family. People who are going into business don't have enough time. If there is a problem about business they should run into business even midnight. Third a salary man take a stable salary from the company. They can save money to bank take interest from the bank whereas a business man might have no money if business is fired. N summary I want a stable job without danger so in my opinion tt is better to work for the company.
