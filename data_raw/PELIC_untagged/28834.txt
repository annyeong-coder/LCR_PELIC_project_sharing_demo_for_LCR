Although it is the truth that societal pressure makes female stay away from science and technical fields I think the different domination of brains is the main cause. Some researches indicate that there are some subtle differences between boys' and girls' brains when their brains are in integration. They show boys are more dominated in their right brains mastering mathematical and rational thinking. Furthermore girls' left brains handling language and emotion are more dominated. Also this phenomenon usually affects their social behaviors. For example boys prefer to play robots and toy cars and girls like to play dolls and house playing. Therefore boys are given more logical and scientific training and house keeping is for girls. Although there are more and more female scientists nowadays because of training I believe people's brains are the main reason that makes boys and girls different.
