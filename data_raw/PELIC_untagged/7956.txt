I had never thought about people in the airport before staying in the JFK. It was January 4th 2007. I arrived to the JFK around 6 00p. M. Shortly after landed in the U. S. For the first time in my life I was watching the sunset over Delta airline building and terminal three and I started organizing about plans here with a deep breathing. Since my next flight to Pittsburgh was January 5th 11 15 a. M. After found my one year luggage I started finding a place to stay for the night. I called dozens of motels which were close from the airport did not have any rooms available at that single night. Rather than going to downtown to find a place I decided to stay in the JFK that night. Because of 14 hours of flight I was so exhausted. So I thought I could sleep anywhere I can sit. However interestingly enough in the airport there were many people to watch to talk and to share that night besides sleeping.
