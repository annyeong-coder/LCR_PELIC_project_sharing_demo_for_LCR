Who or What is making the crop circles in Britain When I first saw the crop circles I guessed that it must just be tricks made by someone who is very handy. I've just thought about crop circles like that so far. According to what I recently heard however the crop circles can not be created by the man because crops lied by some power are hardly damaged. If the man artificially gives strength to crops in one direction the bottom of crops would be damaged. What's more the surprising thing is to grow continually under the condition to get curved. If so what is making the crop circles Some strange spaceship off the ground may have left marks on the field. Or the natural phenomena we don't find could have created those things. Whatever the reason is it must be true that we enjoy seeing those crop circles and have fun to get closer to the truth.
