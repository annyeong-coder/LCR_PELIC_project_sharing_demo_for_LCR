I have already traveled to parts of America. I went there in 2006 and spent a lot of time snorkeling and cycling on beautiful Island. However I have never gone to Egypt but I would like to. I would like to go on a safari and see pyramids. I have never ridden the camel but I would like to do that some day. This has been one of the best experiences of my life.
