I am always thrown off when I have to converse with a native English speaker for something official like apartment contract and account open. While talking with native English speakers sometimes I can catch their silent laughter implying they must have looked down on me because I don't use impeccable English. It could be my illusion and I hope so but I've never had that bad feeling in my country. That laughter often evokes some news I watched in my country. It's about discrimination against Southeast Asian workers in my country. Watching the news I didn't understand their situation. In truth I was totally indifferent to them. However nowadays I feel my situation is similar to theirs. I think it is natural that humans have bias against something or someone because we don't act as a rule like robots. This thought urges me to make an effort to use impeccable English.
