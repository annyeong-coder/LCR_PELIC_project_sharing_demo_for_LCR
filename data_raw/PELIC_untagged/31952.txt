When I was in University I went to beach in south Taiwan with my classmates and beach called Denting we saw many parents who took children been here when we arrived venting beach. Many people swam and surfed in sea strong sun beam was reflected by waves and that harsh to my eyes I took my shoes walked on sand and felt it directly on beach and I felt smooth and comfortable. Suddenly we smelled people took place barbecue on the beach and many children happy laughed them played with their dogs but some girls who screamed who afraid dogs. We felt hungry I thought barbecue smell so delicious and fabulous that we felt hungry we bought chick chops and several beers ate yummy chicken chop with beers were fantasy. It was wonderful summer afternoon in night we lived near beach after dinner we walked around beach and there are many starts in the sky we saw each starts sparkling and obvious. Waves slapped fireworks were played in beach and I like to walk in beach during night than walk in beach in daytime.
