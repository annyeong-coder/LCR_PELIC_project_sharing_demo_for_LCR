I have seen two movies including Wolf Man and Shutter Island both of which I like are recent movie. I am going to write about wonderful movie called Shutter Island located in Boston. Shutter Island directed by Martin who has skillful direction won many awards. The movie reflecting a fact is real story happened in 1900s. There are many characters all of whom were success in the performance. Marshal who is the main character in the movie forced to go the island by trick from the doctors working in the Shutter's hospital for mental disease. Marshal and his partner assigned to investigate for patient escaped from the hospital are working in the Federal department. Marshal wondering about many things in the Island and prisons in the Island was enthusiastic to find the patient who escaped. However This movie which has a puzzle made Marshal doubt in his self that he was the patient that escaped from the Island. This trick acted by the doctors is success to bring Marshal to the island to avoid his crimes. The movie's actors most of whom are interesting and believable.
