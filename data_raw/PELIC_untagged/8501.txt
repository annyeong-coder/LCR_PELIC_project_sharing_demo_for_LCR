When I see my messy room and dark room it brings me down. So I usually chang my house. First I hang up my clothes and I touch my rest room up with brush. Second I take away a garbage. After that I turn furniture around take down old picture and hang up new picture. Last light up my room. Straightening up my house cheers me up.
