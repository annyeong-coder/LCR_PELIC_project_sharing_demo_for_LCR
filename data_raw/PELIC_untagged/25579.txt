There are many places and countries I want to go to. Nevertheless my most favorite place ia the Maldives which is a group of islands. Almost everyone who has been there before says what an amazing place it is. Unfortunately the Maldives is going to sink into the ocean because of the the carbon dioxide. However there is still no pollution and the whole environment remains clear. I want to go to the Maldives with my best friends. In the Maldives you can fish go scuba diving swimming under the ocean do many exerises in the ocean and explore under the ocean world. In addition you can swim play touch the fish and they will demonstrate for you enthusiastionly. The fish is just swimming nearby you. Initially we will have a beautiful memory for us. Obviously we can share our happiness with each other. If you like to swim I think you have to go to the Maldives at least one time. It is such a winderful place. You are going to love this group pf islands but protect this earth when you go there. If you don't you are going to destory this earth.
