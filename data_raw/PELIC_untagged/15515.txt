When I have free time I like to look at my family's picture which memorize me to the time that when I was child. When I look to this picture always I remember the place where I spent most of my childhood time. In this picture you can see my grandma who is sitting at the middle of the picture and my grandpa who is sitting beside her. You can notice my father who is standing behind them. This picture took for along time when my grandpa still lives at the old house which has many memories that I can't forget.
