Writing in my language makes me do my best to do it well but when I want to write in another language I have to work hard because it's not my first language. I have to read the topic carefully for two times before I start then I write down the vocabulary words that I want to use. In addition I must organize my ideas. For example when I want to write paragraphs about car industry I have to begin from past with its beginning and its developing during years until now and continue to the future. I think these are my strength points in writing. When I want to talk about my weaknesses points in writing in English I have to admit the new vocabulary words are my main problem. I usually forgot the new words quickly if I don't use them daily. The other problem is a phrase. I don't have a good vision about the phrases in English but I must learn more new words and phrases to become a good writer in English.
