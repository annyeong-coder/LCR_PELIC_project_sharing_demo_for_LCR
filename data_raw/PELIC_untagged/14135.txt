Dear Confused I am sorry to hear you are in serious concerns. It is a hard decision to make. It's not an easy problem. Let me give you a suggestion. Can you determine your mind that you love Jim Have you been without him since you met him How about going home in Japan at the end of this semester and have a time to think over about your love to Jim. What happens after that is important. If you still feel you want Jim and you should spend your whole life with Jim than you should make a strategy to persuade your parents. It may be more effective to talk face to face. Talk into your parents how much you love Jim and having a different nation son in law hasn't only bad aspect. Make Jim to come to your country and introduce to your parents. Their thought might be change when they meet him. Try this first and if your parents mind won't change let's think about it after that. Take care and hope good results there may be Sincerely Miss Advisor
