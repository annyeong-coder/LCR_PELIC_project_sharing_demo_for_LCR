During working at my job I had started learing english through speacial courses at the british council . Then I had gotten many benefits. I had studied for 7 months . After this happened I had been reading english news to improve my langauge. Also I had been watching movies that speak by enlish to obtain new core vocabulary words. After that I decided to complete the master's degree in the U. S. A. I had joined to the ELI in pittsburgh.
