I have been at pittsburgh since three months ago. My family consist a wife and a daughter actually I have not a son yet and I have been married for 3 years ago. I have already bachelor degree of Computer Science since 2007. I came to United States to continue master degree so I have not master degree yet. I'm looking for an admission of several universities until this point I have not an admission yet. I was seeking to buy an economy car when I did not have a car last month but now I have already Camry for two weeks.
