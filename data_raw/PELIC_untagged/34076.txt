I think the most important in the method of marketing products is to appeal their features and strength on attractive setting such as TV commercials and free promotions on roads. Brands and prices are not principal issues. Once we raise customer's awareness about them in this way there's no more marketing. This is because many people start talking and spreading a good rumor about them.
