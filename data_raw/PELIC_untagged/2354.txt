Every person has his own beautiful moments and the things that reminds him about it. I'll put myself as an example in that so the reader can imagine the picture I'm describing. Before I arrived to the United States I used to live these moment live but now I don't. There's a special holiday called Eid Alfeter in the Islamic religion. That's how my family and I celebrate this holiday. First we gather all the family and we go to pray the Eid prayer. After that we all come back to our place and we have breakfast together. The reason why we all gathered that most of the family comes from other cities because of their work. Next we start to open our doors for the rest of our relatives to visit and celebrate together. We take pictures and spent some time talking about different topics and we share our opinions. That's what we do in the morning but at night we have a different program. Usually we rent a cabin and we spend the time there with different activities like swimming playing soccer and playing cards. We go to the cabin from 6 p. M. Until 7 o'clock at the morning. Finally the next day the family and I go to visit the other people who didn't come. So we can keep the relationship more strong. Now because I'm far from my country and my family because of my studies I can't join them as I were in the past. I really enjoyed those times but know I guess I have to adjust to my new life in the United States.
