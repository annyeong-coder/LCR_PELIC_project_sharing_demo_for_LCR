PARENTS RELAX. The teenagers had been changed they conduct in the last years that means their can start to assume adult roles while they show us enough responsibility and they are capable to make decisions to improve their life. Now we need to perform some question about them like Can they have the real maturity to assume the responsibilities that adults have Can they make big decisions about what is good or bad for them These kind of questions and other more are very difficult to respond but if we look the recently studies probably we need to start thinking about this things. We observer that the teenagers are less violent drink less reduce number of crimes don't use a drugs than before reduce the use of cigarettes and commit less suicide. That means teenagers probably do more changes than we know and now much of them assume the adult role. But those teens have brain potential to make adult level judgment this is one of the most difficult points to resolve because the teenagers know how can they make good decisions but usually they don't make good decisions. The surveys propose that we need to perform some kind of new test to evaluate these comportment changes and probably change the rules and give them more responsibilities about their life.
