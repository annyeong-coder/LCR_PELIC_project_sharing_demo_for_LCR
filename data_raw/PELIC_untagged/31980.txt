The Capsule of My Time My school classmates and I created this capsule of time maybe ten or twelve years ago when my school was celebrated its 40 years anniversary. We buried it at the school I think that it is in front of the cafeteria. I cannot remember all the items that are in side of it. I think that we put in many pictures because they was the evidence of our lives at the school some photograph showed us in our class room I think that one of them was a picture in which my team of volleyball was surrounded a trophy that we won in a tournament. Whit the pictures we wanted to show to feature persons who used to be our lives. Maybe I put in a letter whit my school girlfriend to remember us our love It is funny because in this moment I do not speak with her. My best friend put in the capsule a bottle of water which contains water and a little ship. Other classmates chose for the capsule a lot of objects that represent them I can remember that when I watched carefully inside of the capsule I counted five necklets two estranges rings some ceramic objects that people made for put in the capsule a partner put there his favorite book but the most important thing that that capsule contains is the remember of our school happiness.
