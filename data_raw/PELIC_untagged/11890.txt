My worst experience was when I lost my ballet. Every thing began when I was in a restaurant with my friends. When I was going to pay a check I didn't have enough money that I expected so my friend had to borrow me money. I was embarrassed. Then I remember that I put away my wallet in my bag but when I arrived to my home I checked my bag and my wallet wasn't here. I was so sad because I lost a lot of money that I needed to my trip because the next day I traveled to Barranquilla Colombia. Immediately I cancelled my account bank but I had afraid that my father argues me because first I lost his money and second he doesn't have much patience but in this case he didn't get angry. Finally my father gave me less money than he gave me before.
