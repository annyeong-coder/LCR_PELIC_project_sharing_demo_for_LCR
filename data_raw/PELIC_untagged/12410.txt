I agree that Sports are valuable to society because they provide entertainment especially in the U. S. A. I think spectator sports are simply enjoyable even if the spectators can't understand English. As soon as I started to live in Pittsburgh I recognized that there were many sports programs on TV for example football baseball ice hockey and golf in comparison with Japan or Germany. When I was in Germany I watched a lot of programs which German people discussed about a serious problem which I could not understand at all. So sports are very important entertainment in the U. S. A. Because there are many people who come from all over the world. We are happy as there are good sports teams in Pittsburgh Steelers Penguins and Pirates. When they support these local teams they could have the feeling of togetherness beyond their class creed or religion and so on. Sports can be equalizing entertainment for us. In the Stanley Cup of this year Penguins fought very hard. While I was watching their game on TV in the evening I could feel American spirit Never give up. Though they had lost final game I know the citizens are proud of them. Meanwhile my husband says that he has to watch the Steelers' games because his co workers talk about the result next day enthusiastically. It's their important communication's way. In conclusion sports provide us a lot of chances to make a good relationship with other people in school offices pub etc. I want to enjoy sports as well as possible in Pittsburgh.
