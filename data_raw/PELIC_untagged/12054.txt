This is an anecdote about how I met my husband. When I was 18 years old I took a physics and I struggled with this course because it was hard to understand. One day I went to the library to do research about some phenomenon in physics. I was so stressed out and I started crying because the time ran out and I had not finished yet. Suddenly a man who was sitting at the front table came and offered help in doing my research and I agreed. We had a big crush on each other . Then we dated for three years. After that he proposed and we got married.
