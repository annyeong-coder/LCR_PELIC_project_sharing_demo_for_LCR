Yes it is. It was surprising that a woman who coul not hear was able to learn to play an instrument. I think being able to feel the vibration helps her to keep the rhythm. I think if someone loves something they can do anything. She is a good role model for all typs of people young old specially impaired. Mnay people can learn from her she encourages them. She is a hard worker. She is dedicated to her work.
