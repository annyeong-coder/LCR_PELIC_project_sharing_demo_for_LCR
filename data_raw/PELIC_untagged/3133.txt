I want to talk about my best friend whose name is Su ANON_NAME_0 which means crystal. We have been friends since I was in high school. After three years in high school we went to the different universities where we studied different majors. However because the homes where we lived were very close we met each other often and talked about our lives our boyfriends whom we introduced to each other whenever we met new one and so on. We were very similar in most of things. For example we loved to watch the movie to travel and to go to fancy cafeterias. Once we went to the theater after a final exam in high school. We watched 2 movies without noticing our parents. Our parents who might think that we were discouraged so disappeared were worried so much and then we were scolded a lot after coming back home. Whenever I remember this I cannot help but laughing. Now my teenager friend has become a fabulous woman and I became a mother of a son. Fortunately it happened that we live in the United States where I live in Pittsburgh and she live in New York City. I hope our lives are full of happiness and love and our friendship is forever until we become a granny.
