I called my friend about going on picnic however his phone was turned off or out of service. I didn't give up trying to call him but there was no answer . After one hour I fond a way I called his wife. But she was busy and said please call me back and she hung up the phone . I kept on trying to call her. She answered and I said please don't hang up I would like to speak with ANON_NAME_0 . She answered ok please hold on while I tell him. After minut he called me back. He did not hear me and he said Could you please turn the TV down . I said sure and I turned it off . And I asked him would you like to go with us on a picnic He answered I can't because I ran out of money . You can leave me out and he said goodbye and hung up the phone. I con not let my friend down so I will pay for his food.
