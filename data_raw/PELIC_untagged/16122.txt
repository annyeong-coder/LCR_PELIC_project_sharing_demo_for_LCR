My city has changed it has already had small buildings but now it has been building big and height buildings. The people in my city have already taken the buses to get their business but now they have been owned cars. My city has been increasing the industry. The ignorance has already finished in my city. The people have worn traditional clothes but now they have been wearing style clothes. The people in my city have lived at tents but now they have been living at modern houses.
