I had never lived in English before I came to Pittsburgh. I had lived only in a Japanese world. In the first few weeks I was very nervous. I had never taken English classes which use only English to teach before I came to Pittsburgh. At first I couldn't do many things. I didn't know how to say almost any grammatical words in English such as adjective pronoun and progressive . I got very tired after classes every day. I had never drunk Pepsi Cola before I came to Pittsburgh. I drank it because I tried to order a coffee but I got a Pepsi Cola. I have gotten familiar with these things little by little.
