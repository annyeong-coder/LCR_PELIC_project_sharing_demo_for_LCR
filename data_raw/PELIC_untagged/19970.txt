2 In your opinion what are the advantages and disadvantages of learning how to cook your own meals I can cook my own meals if I know about requirement. Example I want to cook Pasta so I should have a pot salt colander. Next I know about process. I should add something before or after or last. Last I have sense of taste. Example if I add hot sauce in food. Then food has a spicy taste. But Sometimes I feel bad when I cook food. Food has a bad taste.
