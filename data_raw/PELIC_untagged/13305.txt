My name is Student's First Name from Korea. I have been to Pittsburgh since Jan fifth. First of all I like to play baseball and watching baseball games. Then I went PNC Park which is a baseball stadium last weekend. These days baseball is the most popular sport in my country. However it is not popular sport to people who live in Pittsburgh. This is because Steelers and Penguins are very good team in comparison with Pirates. Second my hobby was playing computer games and playing a pool. After I came to Pittsburgh I like to play racket ball that is exciting exercising. Playing racket ball is good for my health so I try to go to Peterson Event Center more than three times in a week. Lastly I want to get a good job after I graduated a university. In my country we need a result of English tests to get a job. Also my brother lives in Pittsburgh. Then I came to Pittsburgh and then I am studying English in ELI nowadays. Also I am doing my homework now. Though learning another language is hard for me I will try to learn English completely.
