My opinion is that a person does need education in order to give good advice in life he or she needs only life wisdom that means understanding of people and life. Having education means the professional side of person and often person with good education do not able to give advice for a life situation. First an academic program gives us professional knowledge that cannot help us to understand a life situation better. It gives us formulas of situation that we would meet on our professional field. However it does not means that education gives us inner ability to understand life and people better. On the other hand a person who has an inner ability to understand people and life does need have special education. For example old people in a village that have no education but their life wisdom and experiences improve their ability for giving good advice. In addition people with good education many times need have good advice from uneducated people. As an illustration I have good education but my parents do not. I often ask them for good advice. However I also ask my sister who has very good education for a piece of advice because she has an expellant inner life understanding beside her education. Beside it I understand that if I get sick and I will need professional advice I would meet a doctor. Furthermore I would ask teacher about English spelling and grammar if I have problem with it. However to get a good advice for a life I would ask a person whom I believe has understanding of people and life. Also I will not look at his or her education because I would need just life wisdom and experiences.
