If you don't know how to plan your trip there is some advice to give you to prepare your trip. First it would economize to book plane tickets and the hotel at online shop. For example I went to Chicago last year I got really good price with the plane and the hotel for four days. However it's a good way to use all the free tickets from the tourist center and also take the public transportation when you travel. Second it will be educational when you travel to another city. Moreover you can go to museums and get a taped tour and then you will get more information. Besides having a guided tour is very useful when you don't know the city very well. Third traveling to different cities or countries will be fun. In fact you will try new foods or things that you never do it. In addition while you are going traveling to the city you will make many new friends they would be share their experiences with you and then you will acquire more messages from their different cultures. To sum up I have some advice for people who want to go traveling to another place that would be helpful.
