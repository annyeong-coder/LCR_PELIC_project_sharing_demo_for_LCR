You may know the truth that our planet can be totally destrored for more than 500 times if all of the nuclear weapons in the world explode but why do we still develop nuclear weapons All the countries who have the ability to create nuclear weapons will answer it is used for peace. That means for example China has nuclear weapon so other countries will be very prudent in considering attack China. That is the so called peace . It just like two people who will keep the peace by putting a knife to each other's neck. Is that a real peace I don't think so. The only possible result for this situation is that someone will kill the other first. It is an un stable situation. So in my opinion every country in the world should get rid of nuclear weapons completely. We don't need the peace with putting a knife to each other's neck . As Einstein said no matter what weapon we use for World War 3 stone should be the only weapon we use for World War 4. It is the most stupid thing for humankind to keep nuclear weapons. As the most intelligent spiecies on earth we are responsible to protect it.
