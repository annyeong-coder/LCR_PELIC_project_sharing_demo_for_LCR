There is terrible issue at Wednesday Jun 13 2007. According the article five children died in fire. Seven children enjoyed with matches in the house and a light that was played by children became a fire. As result of fire five children were died. Unfortunately all of fire exit were closed so victims couldn't run out. However two 8 year old boys could run out the outside they could open a back door. Also police are looking for baby sitter she had taken care of children for evening but after accident she disappeared. Police interviewed both mothers and both children who could run out the outside but they didn't any information about the woman. One of the mothers finished her work earlier in the evening but both mothers didn't stay in home. Most people who live in Pittsburgh memorize that this accident is one of the worst history in the city. Two words 1. I decline a gift with thanks because it unnecessary for me. 2. I will hire a private investigator to find someone who stole my lunch.
