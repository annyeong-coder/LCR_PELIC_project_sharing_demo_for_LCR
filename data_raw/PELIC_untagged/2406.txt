I'm Jaeyeon ANON_NAME_0. I've been living in Monroeville since April 2006. I have a lot of hobbies. First I've been enjoying snowboarding for 3years but I still can't very well. About 3years ago I went to ski area I've learned how to snowboarding. Last month I've already completed slide down a slope medium course. Second I like to make a friends. I've been enjoying meet some people for a whole my life.
