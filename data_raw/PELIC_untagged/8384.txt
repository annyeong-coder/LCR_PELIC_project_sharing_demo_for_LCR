Last year I learned to skate on roller skate. We took roller skate to my brother for his birthday. He has been skating since he was 10 years old. He has never felt. When I saw him on roller skate. I thought I can skate too . I had requested him to teach how to skate but he said no he had been busy. I was really angry with him. After I tried to skate with my effort. I had been trying not to fell but I had failed. I couldn't it. Then I decided to take a lesson for learning skating very well. We work a lot. So far I have felt many times but finally I was succeed. Furthermore the skate has become more than just a way for having fun with my friend. This year I have joined three games and I have plans for many more.
