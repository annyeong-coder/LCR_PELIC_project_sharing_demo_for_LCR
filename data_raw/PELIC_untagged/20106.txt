MY ROOM Before I came to the U. S. A I had know that I would live in my sister s house. She gave me a room to stay. When I saw the room it made me feel bad because there was a old bed old chair and old carpet in the room. My sister said that to be calm down to me and we would set the room up together. I was so happy. First we threw away old bed old chair and old carpet. We went to the Costco and picked new furniture up from Costco. We brought them and put up the furniture in my room. First I put up the table near the bed but I didn t enjoy. After I moved it around in front of the window. Also I put up little information about grammar on the grammar. Everyday I read them. My room chher me up. Everday I want to get back my room immediately to have a relax after the school.
