For the following reasons Oishi is my favorite restraint for lunch in Okland. First of all Oishi sells Asian food. Especially I like Korean food. In there I can eat Bulgogi Bibimbab Kimch Jabchea. They help me to not feel nostalgic. Other Asian foods also are delicious for me. Second when I order to food I can receive food quickly. My lunch time is between 12 00 to 13 00. It is not enough time for me so I enjoy eating in here. In addition Oishi is close to the school. When I walk to the restraint I just spend 5 minutes. Finally the host of restraint is very kind. When I visit there he give me a joyous welcome so I can eat food with good emotion. For these reasons I enjoy eating lunch in Oishi. I will recommend to here for Korean.
