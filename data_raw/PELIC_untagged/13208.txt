The article of English seen as co star among Global languages seems to be more persuasive for the following two reasons. First this article is based on several linguists' perspectives whereas the other article Can English Be Dethroned is based on only one linguist's perspective. The reference to several linguists' perspectives helps the discussion on the subject to develop more and makes this article itself convincing more. Second this article has many figures of data to support the perspectives of linguists in detail. Whereas the other article is mainly discussed from the view of the history of growing English and has no specific data to support the author's perspective this article is discussed based on the figures of data which make the perspectives of linguists more concrete and persuasive.
