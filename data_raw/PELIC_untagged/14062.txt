I think flow and creativity means nutural inclination. When the children walking on the street with their parents. You can find interesting situation because adults have the compulsion to march through and see everthing. But there are hundres of things taht can deeply engross a child here things they can spend hours with. I thought when I was young I had same experience because I had a lot of question about what is that and how can I use that things It is a good guess abd became curious. After then I became adult now because of this process. So I think flow and creativity means natural in clination.
