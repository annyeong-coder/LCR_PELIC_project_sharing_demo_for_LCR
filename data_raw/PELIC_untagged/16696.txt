Today the time management is very popular because people become awakened about the time. I am a one person who never manages time and can not get anything. For example I never plan for my exam so I never get high score. But I always concern about my planning and set the time. However effective time management is mean to continue to the university. Now a day I study ELI in order to develop my English and I plan to take a test before I enter to university. So I try to set time to do homework and study Toefl. After I follow my plan I found the time that I could relax and cleaned the apartment. Now I am learning how to get value of time and I think every time is more advantage when I was busy. In my opinion manager time made me achieved about the study knowledge my responsibility and target.
