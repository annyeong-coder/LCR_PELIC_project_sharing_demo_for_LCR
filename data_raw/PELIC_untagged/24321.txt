My native language is Arabic Language. So I was working as Physical Therapist for Alamal Medical Hospital which made me I have to use English Language in meeting and presentations because people working in the hospital most of them was international speaking English language as a second language . Although my grammer was not impeccable they could usually understand what I meant. In addition to grammatical mistakes I don't have enough vocabulary to speak with a native speakers fluently but learning the suffix and prefix helped me to understand a new vocabulary. From my opinion I didn't face problems to communicate with a native speakers inside a hospital while we were talking about medical issues. However I was facing difficulty to understand them when they were talking about a general issues such as globalisation. Today I am able to communicate with a native speakers whatever the subject but I still have difficult to understand them when they speak to each other especially if they are using slang. I think the idioms and accent are the main factors that contribute into difficulty of English Language as a second language.
