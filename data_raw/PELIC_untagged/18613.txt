In last year the dilemma that I have faced was that I lent my friend 300 dollar but when I asked her to return my money she didn't return. Then I didn't know how I can do. Finally she didn't return my money. Firstly I think that I shouldn't have lent her money. Secondly I think that she might have returned my money without I asked her.
