There are several similarities between ski and snowboard. First of all both ski and snowboard play in the same season. Ski and snowboard need snow so they are winter sports. When snow piles up on the ground we can play them. Another similarity is that both sports are played at the same place. We have to take a ski lift to go up to the top of the mountain because they are only able to go down when the place is not flat. Finally both sports require good balance. Balance is the fundamental skill to learn to ski or snowboard well. Therefore ski and snowboard are both exciting and popular sports that we look forward to every winter.
