I had an interesting experience that I participated in Korean separated family reunion events as a personnel of events. I had never thought seriously about reunification of South and North Korea before I worked for the Ministry of Unification in Korea. Korean separated family reunion events had opened three times a year in 2000 to 2008. The separated families had never met each other since 1950 when Korea separated. As soon as an event started and families met together again all people started crying. By the time the event ended these families had been meeting only for three days. Thus they were glad to meet but they were sad because they have to separate again after finishing the event. After I had participated in these events I changed my opinion that Korea have to reunify for the people. Moreover I was really honored to work in the Ministry of unification.
