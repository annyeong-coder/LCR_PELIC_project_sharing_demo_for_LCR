Hi everybody. I am from Turkey but this year I am living and studying in Pittsburgh. I like here. It is a small and beautiful city. Sometimes I miss my country but we are happy now. Pittsburgh's people are very friendly. This year I am studying English in the ELI and I want to learn English quickly. ELI teacher's are very kindly and professional. They like teaching English. I like swimming playing tennis and reading. I like to read old historical books. I find these books easily from the local libraries. Now I am studying ECFMG examination. If I learn English quickly this examination will be very easy for me.
