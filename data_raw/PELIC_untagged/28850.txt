The Music in my Ipod Many people love music and spend time listening to it. The concept of the music is not for listening we can use music for dancing or for treatment especially in the psychological field. Music spread all the world there is no country does not have music in its culture. Each one love a particular kind of music and for me I have some features that distinguish each music from others. In my ipod which I carry everywhere I have three categories of music which are morning music evening music and relaxation music. Morning music is the category which contains just two singers who are Fairuz and Abdulhaleem. Both singers are correspondence for me because they both have some features in their songs which are similar. Evidently both have songs which are classic and fit the morning mood. In the morning I prefer to listen to calm and romantic music. Evening music category is the category which has distinct kinds of music such as rock and roll hip hop and Jazz music. All the songs in this category have a common factor which is a quick style. I play these songs in any party I make or I play it just for dancing. Also this category contains Arabic and English songs. Relaxation music category is the category which has . In this category I have just one artist who is Yanni. When I have stress or when I feel depressed I just listen to this category. All the songs in this category is calm and help me to relax. Morning music evening music and relaxation music are the three categories in my ipod. Every day I listen to the songs in at least two categories. I love listening to music everywhere and anytime.
