I have two old friends who had lived same neighbor with me for 8 years. One of them who had met first time when I was an elementary is oldest friend to me. And other one that has been being a long time friend since middle school student. There is says A friend in need is a friend indeed. We helped who each time someone of us has a hard time. For example when I move to other city after graduate high school each time I had came up to Seoul I had stayed his home. In addition we who have same interest things have spent much time each other. After I came to the U. S. They still become a support me that feeling alone. Mighty few friends can be relied on in this world. However I sure that will be a lifelong friend who I have known.
