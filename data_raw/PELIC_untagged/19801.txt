Last week I saw a great Israeli movie. The movie which of course was in Hebrew Was amazing movie about a woman that struggle with her past. The movie whose director is a friend of mine was sad and optimistic at the same time and that is what so great about this film. You can really relate to the journey the woman is going through and that another reason why this film is great. The actor who play the woman is not famous.
