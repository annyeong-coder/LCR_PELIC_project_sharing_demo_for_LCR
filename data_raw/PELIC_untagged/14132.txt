The ELI at PITT is a good place for foreign students to study English. First of all the ELI provides many beneficial activities to the students and the number of activities has been increasing recently. The ELI students can naturally experience and learn American culture and language through these activities. Next there are a lot of full time students in the ELI. The status of student enrollment in courses shows that 66. 67 Percent of all the ELI students are taking five courses in this fall semester. This means that there are many hard working students in the ELI. In addition 63 percent of all the ELI students in this semester are male students. Male students are livelier than female students in class. Therefore they contribute much to the good atmosphere of the ELI class. Moreover the students in our class come from many different countries.
