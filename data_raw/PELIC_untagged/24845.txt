Dr. Reeves is a college professor. One of his students ANON_NAME_0 had some problems and needed his help. ANON_NAME_0's sister ANON_NAME_1 was missing. Therefore Dr. Reeves and ANON_NAME_0 went to ANON_NAME_1's apartment to find her. However in front of the apartment one man wearing a mask punched Reeves. After they fight for a while there were a few people came out of the building noticed them. Therefore that man ran away. ANON_NAME_0 didn't know who that guy was. Not only ANON_NAME_1 was missing but also her husband Bill. The reason why ANON_NAME_0 asked Dr. Reeves help her is that his students knew that he is an amateur detective. They opened ANON_NAME_1's room carefully and found that some beer and cigarettes on the floor. However ANON_NAME_1 and Bill don't drink or smoke. When Reeves checked the windows he saw someone move. Someone was in the bathroom.
