Stress at work or school can be a serious problem. A person suffering from too much stress usually finds it difficult to be productive or happy. They are three solutions for the stress. For example relax speak with girlfriend to praying to God. The most important to me I rely on pray to God when I have a big stress. The God will be helping me in this time. So when I pray to God me feeling better and the stress going way. The second important when I have stress I have to call my girlfriend or wife to tell her about the problem and she will tell me some reason. Than she speaks with me about the love. She wants to make me happy. Also she wants to me speak with her very guilt. If the stress is very big she remained me the first problem that I find a good reason for this stress. Finally if I have stress at work I will go to my home or a good place to spend a lot of time there alone. When I want to go to my home. I don't like to noisy thing such as music TV kids and another problem. There are good solutions for me. I would say please try the first one. It is very important for everyone. The stress could be come to you because you are working very hard or someone makes you angry. If you have a big stress you must take relax or a shower. You can't drive the car very fast because the stresses catch you this time. Maybe you can do some accident.
