Writing a personal Letter About Two Products Dear ANON_NAME_0 I am going to buy a new car. As you know buying a new car is one of the most important things so you must think a lot about it. I want to make a good decision for that so until now I have two options one is Toyota Camry and other is Toyota Corolla. Camry and Corolla are both economical powerful and tough cares. There are a lot of differences between these cares. First Camry has more interior space than Corolla. Second the safety and convenience in Camry are better than Corolla also Camry has a navigation system but Corolla doesn't have one. Third the vehicle stability control at Camry is better than Corolla so you can drive Camry with a good control at a dangerous situations. Lastly the voice system in the Camry is much better than the voice system in the Corolla because it has DVD CD changer and a very high quality Mic. However Toyota Camry also has disadvantages. For example Camry is more expensive than Corolla. Camry requires more maintenance and more gas than the Corolla. Also you can transfer from any place to another easily because it has a small size. Finally I want to learn more about these cars to chose the best option for my requirement so ANON_NAME_0 which one of these cars do you recommend for me Sincerely yours
