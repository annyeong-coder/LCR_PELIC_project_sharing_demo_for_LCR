The most unusual lifestyle is the Hikikomori. Because they isolate them self completely from the word out said. Other groups have a small social life but the Hikikomori Live indoor. They do not participate in any activity. They become less talk shy and lose their friends. I think they reject the people for reasons. They may had a problem communicate with others when they couldn't find someone to helped them they set them self a part. However the normal people have the same kind of this behavior in different levels but I can't imagine young people wasting their life by chosen to locked themselves in their room for years.
