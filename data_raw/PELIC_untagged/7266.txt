I was born in Maracaibo where the sunshine is your company during all year and almost all day. Maracaibo is a city where you can find air condition in everywhere because it is the hottest city of Venezuela. I lived in a neighborhood which was quiet and very safe. I remember to my little friends who are very funny. My friends whom I spent the most of the time play with were good students. Sometimes we studied together in my bedroom where we also danced. I also remember the day when my mother cooked my favorite dish. I was so happy. My sisters with whom I have a nice relationship are good persons. I lived with my parents a large period of time but when I was 18 I get married and I moved to my own house. Then when I was 20 I got back to my parent's house which is beautiful and comfortable. After that I got a job with Elmor Laboratories and when I had 5 months working with they gave me a new position. I had to move to Caracas where Elmor has it headquarter. My apartment is located in Caracas which is the capital of Venezuela. This city whose weather is perfect has beautiful mountains. But in Caracas where the traffic is a jam I never can be on time for an appointment and this situation is driving me crazy when I have to visit my customers.
