In the second article author thinks the global share of English is much larger if you count second language speakers and will continue to rise. This supports the first article. But their perspectives of the future of English are totally different. In the first article author thinks that English has dominated the world and will become more wildly used in the world. And some governments use this to denounce the economic because culture imperialism is much more subtle than economic imperialism. And also the author thinks that other minority languages will become extinction. But in the second article the author thinks that the idea of English becoming the world language to the exclusion of others is past its sell by date. I think the second article is more persuasive because it use many data and the data is from 15 to 24 year old group.
