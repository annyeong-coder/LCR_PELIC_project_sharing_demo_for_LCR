I have never thought about my future exactly. However if I think about my future I want to be an ordinary man. In fact I wanted to be a pilot when I was children. After I graduated high school my dream was modified. I entered a university and then I chose my major Electrical Engineering. After that I have been studying electrical engineering for five years. Even though English is not my native language I should speak English with fluency. This is because we need a result of English tests to get a job. Then I am studying English in Pittsburgh nowadays. I think being an ordinary man is one of the hardest dreams as time goes by. The employments have been reduced due to unstable economics. These days increase of homeless is one of social problems. Therefore we can't get a job easily and getting a job will be the most difficult problem in our lives. Though learning another language is hard for me I will try to learn English completely. After 10 years I might be a common engineer and I will get married. At that time I might be a professor in a university if I have a devouring ambition. After I retire from my job I will enjoy travelling and exercising with my wife even though it will be extremely hard to ordinary people.
