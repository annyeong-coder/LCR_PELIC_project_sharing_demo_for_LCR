Wow my village really changed. I lived there for 20 years. At 1980 the village was small. There were only 2000 person but the number has been increasing. When I was a student there were few students at school . Now more and more students have been attending classes. The transportation has been getting more intensive. I have spook recently with my mother she told me that the fashion has been Changing rabidly and the teens look like supper models.
