I usually get up at 9 00. After taking a shower I pack my lunch. I usually pick up some food for lunch the day before going to school. I get on the bus at 9 35. The class starts at 10 00. Teachers bring up students to class and they usually go over the things that we learned yesterday. Sometimes we have to turn the homework in to the teachers. The classes keep on going until 4o'clock including lunch time. After the classes I usually do my homework at the school. I drop by the market for picking up something to eat tomorrow. I arrive at home 6 or 7o'clock and straigten up my home. I eat my dinner at 7 to 8o'clock and I go to the beda almost 2 or 3o'clock.
