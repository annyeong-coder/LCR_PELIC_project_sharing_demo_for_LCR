In 2009 I was in trip to Malaysia for business purpose. Luckily the trip turned to be similar to a tour trip. Despite I was a lone I spent a great time with Malaysian friends who I just met in the trip. Two weeks in Malaysia for business is a short time but I did not miss the opportunity to experience some of its sightsee. The weather was completely different to what I used to but I was amazed and got entertained by attending some concerts. I am sure that anyone will have a great time but just give it a try.
