When you come in my bedroom through door not window the sofa is in front of you nearby front wall. When I came back to my room after studying in the school I always throw my bag on the sofa. It's a role of that except this case I rarely use that. And in the left side of you my bed is located which is covered with blanket. I usually spend almost extra time on watching movie or listening music with my notebook computer on this bed when I am in my home. Also next to the bed you can see the hanger which my clothes are hang on. Actually I don't arrange my clothes everyday so it looks a little bit messy. Across the bed there is my closet to keep my winter clothes with my luggage which I brought when I came to Pittsburgh. Last my desk is next to door of closet and there are some books what help my studying on my desk. However I usually spend time on studying in the school or the a library so don't often use this desk. It is just to stock my book.
