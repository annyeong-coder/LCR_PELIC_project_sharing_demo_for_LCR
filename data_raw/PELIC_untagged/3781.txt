Center Working Mothers Why Not indent Nowadays more and more women work outside the home causing many people to question whether this is a positive change. Many people are against mothers working. They have weak evidences for their arguments. There are many benefits by working such us financially and socially. I think mothers can work without having a negative effect on the family. Indent Some people might say if she works for the money money is not so important. Some men their salaries are not enough for the home and other expenses. So with the salary of the wife it will be helpful for her family. She doesn't have to take the kids to the tender care. The teenagers don't need a tender care also. So her money will not spend in something just the home. Indent Moreover other people say that working for woman can affect her personality negatively. Working outside the home gives a woman a sense of her own personal identity and self confidence. A woman who stays at home will always be known as someone wife and not as a person in her own right. Indent Some people will say the kids and the teenagers should stay just with there parents or not with strange people. In my opinion the mothers can work part time so she can do some good work and she can stay with her children. And she might arrange the working time with her husband also. So they can be with the kids most of the time. One point in favor of mothers working is that their children often earn to be independent from an early age which can only help them in the future. Indent To sum up there are many arguments both for and against mothers working. Every family is different and what is good for one family may not necessarily be good for another. Taking everything into account it should be left to the individual mother to decide whether working or not is something that she wants to do.
