My favorite holiday was the Chinese New Year last year. It was from February 6th to 11th. My family brought us to my grandparents' house with my uncle's family on February 7th. We visted my grandparents when we got there and we had a delicious meal together. We talked about some events that happened during the year and there were many kinds of topics like work children health and problems. Then my grandparents encouraged us to make an extra effort in our lives and they told us not to give up anything easily. They influenced us very much. We stayed only one day and came back home. It was the best of my holidays because I was able to visit my grandparents and talk about everything with my family. As you can see I am very glad to have these relatives. Without them my favorite holiday would not be the best.
