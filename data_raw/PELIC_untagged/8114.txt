My favorite holiday meal is the Chinese new year feast spring festival eve . Usually there are at least 20 40 dishes for one complete meal lunch or dinner . It is composed of appetizers cold dishes hot entrees drinks main food soup dessert. Generally rice is for lunch and dumplings are for dinner. Adults usually drink white wines or rice wine and young children may drink juice or milk. Entrees have poultry chicken duck and goose meat pork beef and lamb and seafood shrimp scallop and fish . The fish is an important dish that cannot be absent because it has the significant meaning of abundance and wealthy. One important food is dumplings In Chinese it is called 'Jiaozi' which has the culture and traditional meanings and it represents wealthy and fortune . The dumplings is very famous for its delicious and is popular almost the world. It needs a lot of work to prepare it. A dumpling has two parts a skin or a wrapper and fillings which are mixed with meats and or vegetables based on your taste. In order to make it delicious you may add some seasonings such as soy source salt black pepper white pepper brandy or sherry alcohol sesame oil garlic ginger spring onion cilantro chives celery Chinese cabbage carrot black mushroom etc. After rolling the skin you can put meat or vegetables in it and then you can cook it usually dumplings will be boiled by hot water.
