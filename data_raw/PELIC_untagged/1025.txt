10 23 2006 Dear Ruba I received your last letter and I'm very happy that you are all fine. Speaking of family matters I recently decided to change my oven. However I'd like to have some advice from you. You know I have had a gas oven for 10 years. It is old now. I thought if I want to repair it it will cost a lot of money. Therefore I would be willing to pay for a new one. I feel that it is difficult to make a decision from many available options of the two main kinds of ovens a gas oven and an electric oven. They are different in two main ways. A gas oven is usually healthier for cooking than an electric oven. In contrast you will find an electric oven is safer than a gas oven. For instance I'm having trouble with a gas oven when I change the gas cylinder. However an electric oven doesn't need refill. Also there are more diverse offers of the electric ovens than gas ovens. For example there is a digital electric oven the self clean electric oven and the electric oven with a flat surface on the top. I liked the last one. It was awesome but I found the cost of the electric ovens was more expensive than gas ovens. Anyway when I have the new oven you will be the first person I invite to share cheese cake. I know you adore a cheese cake so I'll make the special one for you. Love
