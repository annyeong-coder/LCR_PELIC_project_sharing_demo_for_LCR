If I could choose I would not like to live in Leisureville. People who live there are really carefree and happy in the views of visitors but I hold that their lives are real but virtual. For everybody life is permanent only in an extremely short period. Therefore we have to ponder carefully how to spend our lives. Although happiness and satisfaction can make people feel good however sadness disappointment and suffering can create a greater appreciation for life. Therefore I consider that everybody doesn't need to live in Leisureville even if one is a widow.
