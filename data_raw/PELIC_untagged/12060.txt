My home city and Pittsburgh Gunsan city is my hometown. Now I live in Pittsburgh. Two cities have similarities and differences. So I am going to compare Gunsan and Pittsburgh. Similarities of two cities are heavy traffic jam the rivers and mountains. Differences of them are size the swimming pool many trains location and languages. Pittsburgh and Gunsan don't have heavy traffic jam. They are not big cities. Also they have orgernized transportations. Both of them have the river and mountains. The rivers are big but mountains are not high. Also they have differences. Gunsan is smaller than Pittsburgh. In Pittsburgh it has a swimming pool like the sand castle. In Gunsan doesn't have a swimming pool but it has the sea. And then Pittsburgh has many trains but Gunsan has few trains. And Gunsan located in South Korea but Pittsburgh located in U. S. A. In Gunsan speaks Korean but in Pittsburgh speaks English. After comparing two cities I had a decision. I like both of cities. Also two cities are important to me.
