I have been most influenced by my father. I have been taught many things by my father such as studying meeting people and keeping my health. Even now I can ask him about that kind of things when I call him. I'm still inspired by him. It's always helpful for me. One time I was needed an advice about my health because my body didn't feel good so I asked him about the symptom. Then I was persuaded by him to exercise almost everyday. Also he influences me because of passion of his work. He is respected by his friends to work hard in his job. He will always be remembered by me for a best person.
