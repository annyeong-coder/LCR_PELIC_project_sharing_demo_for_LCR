Although almost every word has its synonym each one has its own nuance. That's what happen with 'buddy' whose definition from Longman English Dictionary it's an informal way to say 'friend'. I don't know the real answer so to me a buddy is a person who go out and have fun with you. It's close to a friend or at least it's a kind of I mean you spend a good time with him but in the end it's a person whose life you don't know to much. However I'm confuse because according to the second meaning from Longman this dictionary define a buddy as someone who you don't know but I've asked to an american woman and she compares a buddy with a best friend someone you tell those things that are really important to you. One thing is clear every word has a nuance that make it unique.
