In 1994 I entered an art high school and I made a new friend whose name was Su ANON_NAME_0. We had a very similar personality and studied together for 3 years. We could have entered the same college. However she entered a coeducational college and I was admitted to a school for women. Some one said Out of sight out of mind . That might have been right. We should have met frequently to solve problems between us. A invisible wall might have been made between us. The misunderstanding might have caused a seven years'estrangement between us. We should have given consideration to each other but we could not have. I might have apologized to her but I didn't.
