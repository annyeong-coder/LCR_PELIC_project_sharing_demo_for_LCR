There are many controversial issues may accrue as a consequence of the government organization such as in the educational system. In my opinion making the schools include both genders could be the causative for many problems between the students especially teenagers. As known teenage is the hardest stage that the human goes through due to its sensitivity for example the girls in this age are very emotively and they could believe any words from the boys which it may leads to teen pregnancy. From my perspective the separation between the children from age 14 to 18 is the best protection for them. I experienced this system in my country Libya from age 13 to 18 . This stage was very effective to many girls like building self steams without any confusing effectiveness such as the boys. Even though after I went up to collage I studied with males it has never been a strange situation for me I think because I was in the right age to deal and study with different gender. Overall I believe division between opposite sex is the best way to avoid any complex relationships with keeping some common activities between the two genders such as summer projects sports and scouts.
