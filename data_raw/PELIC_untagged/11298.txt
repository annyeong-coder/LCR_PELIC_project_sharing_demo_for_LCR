Do friends have to be who have the same interests or personality I think that in some cases my best friend and I have similar interests. My best friend ANON_NAME_0 is someone whose personality is completely different from mine. She is a sociable person who enjoys being with other people but I am a shy person because for me it is difficult to star a conversation with someone. She is an easygoing person who doesn't worry much or get angry easily but I am not an easygoing person because I am worry for everything and get angry easily. However we have a similar interests for example we like a place where go every Saturday and we always talk about our problems friends family etc. We met at school where we spent many happy and sad moments. I remember a sad moment when she said me that she had cancer. This year was difficult for both but now she is recovered and she has an organization where help children with cancer. I learned with her to appreciate my life and enjoy my life every time every moment and every day. Punta Cana Dominic Republic which is a very exciting place was very distracting. We went last year and we did many activities and every night we went to the disco. This trip was nice and it was a happy moment.
