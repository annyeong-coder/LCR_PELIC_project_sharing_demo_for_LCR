I will give you some advices before you visit my country. First of all you should make a good plan to visit Alriyadh Jeddah and Aldamam. Second of all you SHOULDN'T worry if you get stuck in heavy traffic. You OUGHT TO carry have cash bills all the time because most shops don't accept credit cards. You HAD BETTER shake hands when you meet someone there. Saudies like to shake hands. You HAD BETTER NOT smoke in public places.
