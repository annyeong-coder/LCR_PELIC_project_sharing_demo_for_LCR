Although we have been trying to easier dispose of garbage it is difficult to find the soulution of getting of garbage. We have undergone processes of trial and error. In order to slove this problem we should try to recycle garbage such as plastic bottle paper and so on. According to the Ministry of Environment in Korea If this policy is performed by people in korea The goverment in korea can save money in getting of garbage. Then the goverment can provide people lots of benefits by using the money for the other policies. The recycling is a good way for people and the goverment in my country to dispose of garbage.
