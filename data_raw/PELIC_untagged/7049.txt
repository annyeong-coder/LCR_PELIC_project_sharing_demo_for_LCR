Telling the truth is the most important consideration in any relatioship in some points Haw to say the truth why you want to say it and when you say it. First I agree to say tha truth in appropriate way. There is a distenquish between saying things openly and raghly. I think that keeping warm relationship with others need us to be trusful in our words and to express things openly without hurting others. For example the expreisson I don't like your way has to be much better when you say I think you have your own way but . Second I agree to tell the truth in appropriate situation. We can't say every things it is disustors. For instance we should say just what can protact our relationship. In case you quisined about things then remmeber how to say it before you talk. Finally I agree to say the truth in apropriate time. The better time you choose the better result you find. For instance most people can't hear the truth when they are angry. If the person doesn't ready arrang an apointment to meet this person to say the truth that you feel you should say it. In conclosion I feel that saying the truth is the most importing things in any relationship. However I like to conseder tha way the situation and the time to tell the truth. In my opinion laying is the worst soulion for any relationship.
