Actually if the traditional lifestyle make up of career marriage children or something like that I'd like to try nontraditional lifestyle because I'm young and I really like to try new things rather than just follow others. Although live a traditional life may be CAREFREE not be DISTURBED by other new questions or challenges I still want a different life for myself. But it not means I'd like to have an ISOLATED life like the Hikikomori. Maybe I will not get married or even I get married but not have children. I will combine my own business with my interests when it success and I earn enough money I will make my dream come true take my camera and laptop to travel all over the world. In the LEISURE time maybe I'll write a book about myself my family and friends and our life it needn't to be published because I really REJECT to show the privacy to everyone it's just a gift I'd like to share with my family and friends.
