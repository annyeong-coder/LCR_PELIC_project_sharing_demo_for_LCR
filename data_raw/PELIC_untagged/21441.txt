Writing 3H Composition 3 My Neighborhood There are many places in my neighborhood that I like going to. First of all there is a park that is owned by my grandfather. It is a huge park and the park has an area of about one hectare. My friends and I used to go there every Saturday and we used to go in all the rides such as driving the unreal small cars swimming and I challenged all of my friends in the pool swimming. Although my sister was a difficult challenge for me however I was the winner of all the contests that we have done . Thus it is why I like going there. Second the soccer field from my neighborhood is very closer to my house. It is one of the biggest buildings in my neighborhood. Every year they organize a competition with a value of 1000 . I had a great team and we participated to the competition. At the end of the competition we won. I like going there because exercise is very good for your body and give you more energy. As a result exercise makes your body in a good condition. Third there is a huge mosque in my neighborhood and also the biggest which I like going. The interior is very comfortable and I used to go there every Friday because it is like a tradition. Every Friday all Muslim meet there to pray together and ask Allah god to accept our prayer and make easier our belief. I really like my religion and I participate in it one hundred percent and for these reasons I like going there. Finally I like also going to the supermarket because there are my favorites food there. I used to go there to do grocery for my mother and almost everyone there knows me. In conclusion I enjoy going to those places because they are very special to me.
