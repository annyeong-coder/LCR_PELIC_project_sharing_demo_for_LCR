I heard a new prison would be built in my neighborhood I really think this is a bad news. I can't agree with this decision. In my opinion the prison will cause some security problems and destroy the calm peaceful atmosphere here. Our neighborhood always is a very quiet and safe region. A prison where lots of criminals live is a threat to our lives. I feel uneasy about it. I will be anxious when my children playing outside because I can't ensure if some dangerous prisoners skip out it. On the other hand I think we have to bear the noises of many police cars. Sometimes I think it is difficult to explain why those people were put into jail to my young children. I don't want my children to feel the world filled with crimes I hope they have a positive attitude to our world. I like our present neighborhood. I'm against that a prison will be built here. It undoubtedly will decrease our life quantity.
