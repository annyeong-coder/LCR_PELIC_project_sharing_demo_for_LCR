Yes I think. When parents learn their children how to cooking the children become more dependent on their selves . Also give the children some skills about how to dealing with kitchen that will be help them in future when they need to cook food. I think learning the children how to cook in home will be avoid them to eat unhealthy food in restaurants like fast food .
