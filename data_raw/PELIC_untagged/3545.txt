Welcome to new ELI students. When you start to study at the ELI you should buy new books on the book store. If you want to save your money you can buy used books but you should erase your book before starting your class. I think you have to study hard because the ELI have a lot of tests and home works. You ought to do your homework in your home not in the class and you must prepare your test sufficiently. Next if you make your Pitt photo ID you don't need to pay when you take a bus go to museum etc. It is very beneficial because it is for free and it can save much money for you.
