I live in one bedroom apartment with my sister. There is a big bed in the center of our room. The yellow comforter that my sister and I covered up the bed makes me feel good. But we don't like the curtain on the windows because of the color. So we want to pick out a new one someday. Also we have two broken chairs in front of our door. I think we should throw them away soon. In addition there is a small hole on the wall that we cannot touch up but I think my landroad doesn't care.
