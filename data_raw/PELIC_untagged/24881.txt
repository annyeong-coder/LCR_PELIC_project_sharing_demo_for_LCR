Why Male Children are Preferred More Than Female Children In Japan sometimes parents prefer to have male children rather than female children. Of course female children are precious but having male children sometimes has more important meanings than having female children. There are two typical reason of this preference Parents want to live with their children and they want to continue their family. First reason is that parents want to live with their children after children get older. Until recently it is a usual thing that three generations grandparents parents and children live together. By living together people can share earning knowledge and help when someone needs care. However if parents want to live with their children male children are more reliable than female children. Because women generally leave their parents house after merry in many case parents can' t live together with their female children. In general case the oldest son continues to live together after he gets older. By this reason parents who want to live with their children prefer to have male children than female children. Second reason is to continue their family. Although this reason is related to the first reason this reason is more institutional. In some case Japanese people think family history as important thing and it is considered that only male children can carry on their tradition. For example family name is usually taken over by male children because women change their family name when they marry. In addition if a family owns their business the oldest son is supposed to take over their family business. In summary Japanese parents prefer to have male children when they want to continue their family. Sometimes this custom sounds strange and it isn't fare for female children. However it is a deep rooted feeling and difficult to eliminate.
