I am from Brazzaville the most beautiful city in Congo. Pointe Noire is the most multicultural city in Congo. Brazzaville is the most expensive city. Pointe Noire is the least modern city. Brazzaville is the least boring city. Brazzaville is one of the friendliest city to go. It is also the oldest city. Pointe Noire is not the safest city.
