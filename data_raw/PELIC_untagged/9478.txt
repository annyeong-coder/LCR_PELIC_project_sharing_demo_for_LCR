I really impressed when I read Dr. Schwartz's advice. Actually I knew and heard about online dating before however I didn't think about what should I do or don't. After I finish reading Dr. Schwartz's advices I realize that if I really want to enjoy on line dating I should do and prepare to meet nice person by internet. The first advice that I found necessary and valuable is spending time to know someone. I think everyone who wants to experience good one line dating have to spend enough time to express him her self to give specific information and to know each other. Also secondly impressed advice is having good attitude. In other words being optimistic and positive is good way to experience enjoyable on line dating. Next two advices that I don't think absolutely correct advice are being an honest person and not being a talkative person. In some cases everyone needs a little white lie. Definitely telling big lies is a bad habit such as pretending to be a millionaire or faking age however when the little white lies can make the situation for all better we need to use little white lies. The last advice that I don't really agree is to not be a talkative person. Talkative person could make the mistake monopolize the conversation and not give the chance to speak. It's seriously bad and rude manner however if we met a really timid and shy person we'd better be a talkative person. If we keep talking and trying to make someone relaxed probably he she will appreciate your effort. These are all of my opinion about Dr. Schwartz's advice. Thanks!
