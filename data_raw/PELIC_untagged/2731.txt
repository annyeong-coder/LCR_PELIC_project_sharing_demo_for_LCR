My home is warm. When it's too cold outside my home turn into an heater. It makes me clam down and relax. That's why I like to ask someone over my home. While One room I share with my sister is cold. It's big and it doesn't make me feel cheer up. Whenever I go to bed I don't want to go thourgh the door. If it's too cold I go back to the living room and sleep on the couch. I want to change this room like other rooms. My sister and I usually straighten up everywhere so it doesn't look massy. Sometimes we fix things up for making a new atmosphere.
