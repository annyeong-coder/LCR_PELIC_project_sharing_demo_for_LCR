Before I came here I had never played soccer on grass. I like to play soccer but in Korea daoen't have many grass soccer fields. I had just played soccer on sand. When I play soccer on grass I can hit the ball esaily and when I fall down on ground I don't get hurt much. After I go back to Korea I will never forget my fascination with soccer fields.
