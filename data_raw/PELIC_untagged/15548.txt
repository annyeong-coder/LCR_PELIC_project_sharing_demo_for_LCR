Both two team have lots of sportsmanship especially for the Dekalb also both team have a very good relationship. Since Franklin's mother died one of the Milwaukee Madison players the coach and his teammates grieve for him and wanted to postpone the game . However Franklin agreed to let the game play and he had showed up for the game too. Ofcourse the Dekalb team also know about this news as well. During the play made a technical foul which meant that Dekalb will get two free throws. However Dekalb coach and the players don't want to make it as their advantages from this situation. So they said they are not going to take it. This made everyone in the stands appreciated and also to the Milwaukee team. The sportsmanship that they showed to each other was a good thing. They know that winning is not the most important thing in sports. Everyone in the team are very close to each other and when any of them have any adversity they all are willing to hellp each other.
