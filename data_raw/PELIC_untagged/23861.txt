Talking about the difference between a buddy and a friend some native speakers told me the following A friend is a person or someone who you can trust him her. In addition a friend is the one whose his her presence in your life is very important for you because you can share your feelings and your secrets with him her. Therefore a friend can also become a confidant because is someone that is close to you and listens to your private feelings. A buddy is someone whose interests are similar to yours. So you can have a circle of buddies . You can have a buddy for playing soccer shopping walking together collecting stamps traveling somewhere during the summer etc. You can have a buddy for a particular thing like a hobby. . . That you are used to doing and another buddy for another particular thing. Some native speakers said that you can trust your buddy and share your secrets with him her but it depends on what kind of buddy you have. If you trust your buddy you will share your secrets with him her if not you will only share the interests. In conclusion a buddy is someone whose friendship hasn't been tested by you yet but he she should become your friend maybe after testing his her friendship by telling him her a secret that you think it will not cause problems for you.
