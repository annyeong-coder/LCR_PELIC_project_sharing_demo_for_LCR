There are many languages in Taiwan including Chinese Taiwanese Hakka and aborigine language. Actually we say we speak Mandarin not Chinese. It is a political issue. Some people think that Chinese is China's language. When I was a little child I was taught Mandarin in school. However my parents always talked to me by Taiwanese. They knew Mandarin but not used it often. I didn't know how to say Taiwanese but I knew what they said. So I always answered by Mandarin. If I wanted to talk to my grandmother who just knew Taiwanese I used Taiwanese words and my body language. Now it's changed. Taiwanese are become more popular. Students are taught Mandarin and Taiwanese in school. People should know how to speak Taiwanese. I even helped my parents working in a traditional market. There some people were from the Southern Taiwan. They just spoke Taiwanese. If someone talked to them by Mandarin no matter that people were customers or friends they would be angry and no business with that people. They always told to me You are not a real Taiwanese. Because my Taiwanese was not fluent like them. In this market everyday I met a lot of different people and I had to change languages quickly. After this experience my Taiwanese became more fluent and I learned how to recognize which people speak Mandarin or Taiwanese.
