Since I launched the ESL classes I have acknowledged that learning language is a lifelong process. I aspire to enhance my learning ability while trying to assimilate into the diverse group. I attribute my great inspiration of study to my teachers' framework. Instilled by teachers I hone in my English inevitably. In my pastime I hang out with my friends and chuckle a lot. I will retain my passion and keep on pursuing my dream in Pitt.
