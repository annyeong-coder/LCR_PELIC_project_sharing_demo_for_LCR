Oct 16 2006 10 16 Dear Li I moved into a new apartment recently. I changed my telephone number. My new telephone number is 412 615 1072. Please call me if you are free. I told you that I want to buy a car last letter. Recently I have discovered two different used cars. I like them both but I will only buy one. One car was made in Japan Nissan 1998 and another car was made in Germany Jetta 1995 . I prefer to choose Jetta for three reasons. First I think Jetta is safer than Nissan. I have often read some reports that said cars made in Germany were firmer than cars made in Japan. Taking a Germany car is more secure than taking a Japan car. Second The Jetta is cheaper than the Nissan. Third the miles that the Jetta has run is less than that of the Nissan. However the Nissan is newer than the Jetta. Two cars engine both are very good. It's so hard to choose one. Could you give me some advice. Best regards
