It goes without saying that my favorite place to eat lunch in Oakland is chinese restaurant. First of all everyone use to eat their country food including me especially chinese food is famous in the world. In addition I don't like to eat much fast food such as TACO KFC. . . . And so on because I think it is bad for our body if you often eat. The most important thing that it is easy to meet friends who come from Taiwn so we can eat lunch and chat each other especially in short lunch time. Finally it is cheap and I can easy to order meal . For these reasons I pretty like to eat linch in Oakland .
