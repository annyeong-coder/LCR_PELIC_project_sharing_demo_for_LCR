Global warming raises concerns about our future! It is said that many unusual changing of weather are caused by global warming. In fact it is not inevitable our careless habits generate this problem. Pollution is the main factor here. Unfortunately we are very obsessive about cutting edge industries and technology without paying attention to a huge negative impact of industrial waste products. As a result of that The problem becomes worse day after day. Future generations' lives are in danger. We have to stop thinking to much about ourselves and give these people a little bit of our concern. They are our sons daughters grandsons and granddaughters ! The best solution is to economize producing materials whose waste products harm the environment and looking for alternative friendly ingredients that use in industry even if they are expensive because nothing is more expensive than our offspring's lives!
