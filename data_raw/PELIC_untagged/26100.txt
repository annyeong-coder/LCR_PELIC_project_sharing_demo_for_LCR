I think that she wasn't limited by her imperfect English. Even though her pronunciation or grammar was not good she was always confident to her English. Sometimes she needed her daughter's help because some of native Americans ignored her or didn't take her seriously. However she wasn't reluctant to say something in English outside. Also she read the Forbes and listened to Wall Street Week which are full of academic or difficult contents. It means that her life wasn't limited by her English.
