Welcome to my website! Hi this is my website I had been building this website for several months and finally I had finished. This is a front page I made it to introduce myself to the visitors of this site. I am a sociable and easygoing person who likes to play sports. I grew up with friends that likes to play soccer mostly. So obviously I like to play soccer. At my home country we play soccer mostly everyday. My educational life I had studied in a private school from middle school until high school and now I had been studying at the ELI in Pitt for approximately 5 weeks. Finally I don't want you to get bored from the beginning so I'll let you surf the website for now. Thank You !
