Writing is a very hard skill that requiers alot of effort some people spend there hole life trying to improve their writing skills. In the book Seeds of Hope for Henri Nowen he talks about how hard is to write about a subject. Writing for students sometimes is hard some of then have alot of problems when they start writing for example every time I have an exam for wrinting I get scared and I have a deep rooted fear of it. Writing for students have three main points The author talked about them in his book seeds of hope alot of students have deep rooted fear for writing writing require's hard work writing reveals to us what is alvie in us. First and foremost alot of students have deep rooted fear when they have an writing exam For example when I see a plain white paper and some one tells me to fill it in a time range I get scared that I wont do perfect and I wont find the words that fit what I'm trying to explain. In addition Writing require hard work and detarmnation to achive perfect writing as an example if you skip writing class you will miss alot of nececary details that will improve your writing skills I used to have problems in writing still now but I try to work hard to improvie it. The benfits of writing is to revel to us what is alive in us The writer said that writing tells us what is alive in us I fully agree with him because when you write a plain white paper you will use everything you know to write it up. Finally writing for students is very diffcult and some experince fear of it and you have to work hard to achive and improve your writing and the bright side of writing that it revels to us what is alive in us. For me the Henri Nouwen was right you have to work hard and free your self from writing fear and fly in your imagnation and write.
