I would like to study my master degree in nursing since so there is some steps I have to do. For example I've already registered in ELI institution to improve my English language I've moved to US already now I'm living in Pennsylvania stats at Pittsburgh city I've been rent an apartment also I've been studying English. But I haven't bought a car yet and I haven't passed TOEFL test yet. Also I still haven't taken NCLEX test and I haven't registered in nursing school yet.
