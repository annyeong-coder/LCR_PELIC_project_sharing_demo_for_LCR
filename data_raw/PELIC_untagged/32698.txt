My new home is a lovely house in Squrriel Hill. I live here with Joyce we live in one room. First day we moved in the house we straightened room up because there are some things the former tenant left. And we hung our clothes up in the closet. The house has a white board we wrote down our name on it to let other roommates know us. I like this board because we can leave messages to each other in case that person is not home. It seems nothing have to improve our landlord already set everything up for us. If it must to say I hope our roommate and us can talk over the garbage. We should distribute when and who to throw the garbage away. I think after I go back to my country I will miss this house.
