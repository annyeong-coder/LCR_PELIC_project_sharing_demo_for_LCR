I love father. Because my father is my parents he is my colas friend too. He was a special engineer who signed traditional my country's patter on the clothing. In his free time he was happy to play a game of the cards. I was a child he was always training me to play the skills of the cards. I didn't like it because my learning was hard sometimes I couldn't remember those members so l was not willing to do. But my father almost encouraged me to practice more and more. He wanted to train my mind such as organization memory account thinking etc. As soon as I accepted my father's ideas. I learn my father's good ways of playing the cards whole my father was also becoming my good friend. I always thank my father who trained me many skills of doing some things. It suppers my life
