If we want to save extra money for a special trip we could save more and spend less in these effective ways. First of all we take our lunch with us every day. Eating out costs much more money than cooking ourselves. Delicious handmade meals make us sustain and satisfy so we might not feel frustration without eating out. To enjoy making and eating meals must be the best way to save a larger sum of money than the other ways for a short period of time. Next we walk to go to school and go shopping if it is possible distance to do. Walking is useful not only to save money but also to exercise for a change of pace. We also do not need spend extra money for a gym. The third one is to reduce the cost of utilities. When I finish using electric appliances I usually pull the cord out of the wall to cut vampire energy. When I brush my teeth I turn off the water. Some people use after bath taking water to wash their clothes. About utilities we have to do a little effort to cut them down each time. The last one is to join free entertainments which are offered by cities or schools. If we join such events we can enjoy and meet a lot of people free. We can also borrow many kinds of DVDs in libraries free. Doing these daily small effort will make us enjoy life and acquire extra money for a special trip at the same time. After successfully saving enough money for a special trip we will enjoy it more and more.
