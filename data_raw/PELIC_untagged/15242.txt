Have been visiting one of these cities before Because I had been living in Riyadh City Saudi Arabia Capital City before I moved to Pittsburgh in the United States I have a lot of information about these cities. Therefore there are many differences and similarities aspects between them. First there are several similarities between Pittsburgh and Riyadh. Therefore in Riyadh city you can meet a lot of people from different countries and of course that will help to learn different cultures. Likewise Pittsburgh City has the same feature. Moreover Riyadh is struggling from people crowded and the traffic as well. Similarly there are too traffic and a big number of population in Pittsburgh. Furthermore both cities have the same international restaurants such as Macdonald Pizza Hut KFC and so on. In addition people in these cities are friendly and cooperative with each other. Thus these conjoint aspects between theses two cities made them from the most beautiful cities over the world. Second there are many differences between these two cities. For example health care in Pittsburgh such as UPMC Hospitals is considered one from the best hospitals over the world. However the health care in Riyadh is good but the same rank as Pittsburgh. Moreover the weather in both cities is totally different. Subsequently in Riyadh it is sunny and hot especially in the summer season. Unlike it is too cold with snow in Pittsburgh. Furthermore there are some differences in social traditions between these cities such as marriage methods clothes kind and etc. In conclusion there are many differences and similarities between Pittsburgh and Riyadh Cities in many features such as health care education traffic and population and some social traditions.
