Taiwan is a small island however there are too many factories in it. Taiwan used to be a very poor country. In order to change this kind of situation the government had established many factories such as steel factory chemical factories and plastic factory thirty years ago. Accordingly these investments did help us to improve our life but that also had us have too much pollution in the small island. Worse yet we have to face new environmental issue today. Nowadays we have too many vehicles such as cars and motorcycles which generate serious air pollution. Thus the air quality in big city is really terrible. Ironically the people in Taiwan have to spend a lot of money to take care of problems that caused by the air pollution
