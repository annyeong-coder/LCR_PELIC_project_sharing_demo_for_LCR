Yesterday I chatted with my friends on the internet. It'd been a long time to talk to friends so I enjoyed doing it. At that time I had do something else but I didn't do because of having a conversation with them. I might have stopped doing it but I didn't. Now I feel that I should have done something else that I was going to do.
