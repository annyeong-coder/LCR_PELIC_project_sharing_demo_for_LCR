When I was younger I had several dreams that I absolutely wanted to accomplish. Like graduate from a scientist high school join the national soccer team of under 18 years old go to the United States for my academic studies speak english fluently and become rich. Actually I have already graduated from a scientist high school. I already joined the national soccer team of under 18 years old too. As the same I have already come to the United state for my academic studies. But I don't spoke english fluently yet. And I haven't become a billionaire yet. So far I'm just 19years old and I have been in Pittsburgh since August So I have all my time to accomplish my dreams.
