When I was kid my family went to the zoo. My parents gave my brother and me time to see animals freely. Therefore we could various animals what we wanted to see. At that time while seeing animals we found the new fact to us that some animals' life style like other animals' life style. On the other hand a few months later I went on an excursion to the zoo. However my classmate and I were controled by our teacher and we just followed our schedule. Because it was a very boring trip I didn't remember any my teacher's explanation.
