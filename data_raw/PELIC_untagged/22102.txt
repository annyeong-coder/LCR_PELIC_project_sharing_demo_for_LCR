My Last Christmas Day At the last Christmas I was in my country. Before I came The U. S I wanted to celebrate it very well. It was unforgetable because after The Christmas I had to leave my country. I saw my best friends my sisters and who I wanted to see. All of us are living different cities so we came together. I wanted to organize that and before that day I called everyone for to come together. My plan was working because everybody said 'yes'. We met a city which located the nearest area to our cities. Finally everybody was right there. My friend who is living this city provided a house for us. We went this house and focused to beds. Everybody was sleepy so we took a rest. After that time we went to shopping and bought what we needed. Everything was ready for the party. Before the twelve we talked danced ate something and drank. My sisters and best friends didn't see eachother before it was first time and they had a lots to talk so we were missing to count from ten. We would stay at last year but we caught and counted to back.
