An ANON_NAME_0 where I grew up was a small city. By 1979 my father had worked as an architect and my mother helped him almost everything. Most of my neighbor said that my parent was honest and diligent. They worked very hard and when I was 7 years old we could buy a new house and several buildings. I have lived there for several years where I spent many happy hours. I played there everyday with my bother whose name is Dae ANON_NAME_1. My brother who was a very naughty boy was the king of the kids. He made friends whom he met in his school. He usually used to go fishing the river with his best friend who lived in about a mile from my house. It was very hot summer day when my brother and his friend made a Styrofoam boat and they were already aboard the ship. My brother was almost killed himself. However his friend saved him from drowning. My father gave him a real scolding. Five years ago my bother met his best friend who made a success in his life.
