First of all changing suddenly for teenagers is a serious problem. It is obvious that the main reason for your friend's change is that he had a new bad group of friend. So I recommend you to talk over this problem with him and avoid going out with them if he invite you. Secondly I think if he did not care about becoming a good person again just do not waste your time with him and focus on your self. But I am sure that making the room messy annoying any roommate that is why I understand that you face a big problem with that. So I think it is will be better if you notice the place owner about that and ask him take an action to prevent that as soon as possible.
