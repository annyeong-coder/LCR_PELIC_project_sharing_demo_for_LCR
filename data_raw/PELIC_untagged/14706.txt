Mr. Wang was a mathematic teacher in my high school. He is a great teacher. He gave me a big help when I was studying math. I did a lot of mathematic exercises. Wang always had me check these exercises when I finished them. Math in high school is very difficult for me. I often made some mistakes. When it happened Wang let me think what was wrong. I found mistakes but I didn't know how to fix. He let me look for textbook to find answer by myself. Then he was very careful to teach me about them until I understood. Sometimes I found some very interesting and hard questions. I couldn't answer. He always helped me resolve it. I enjoyed it very much. I missed him. He got me to know that how to think and how to do when I made mistakes.
