When I was child my first teacher was tough and nervous. He had me write all lessons that I had taken on the week and he didn't let me play soccer all the week. At the middle of the week my uncle got my father to let me play. He made me correct my mistakes in alphabet seven times. After all these I really owe him a favor because he helped me read and write well.
