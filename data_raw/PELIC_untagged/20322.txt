When I see a ballet it triggers my childhood. When I was a kindergarten student I was engrossed in a ballet. Although I attended a ballet class that was a part of class of kindergarten I wanted to go the ballet institution which teaches a ballet professionally. However my mom didn't want me to go the professional ballet class even if she didn't allow me to access that class. I asked her several times why she didn't want me to do ballet then she said in her opinion I didn't have inherent ability in a ballet that need innate abilities if I were succeed in. After grown up she revealed the underlying reason. She inhibited me form the ballet because she just wanted me to study more than art. However I'm still interesting in a ballet and if I had a chance I would learn a ballet again.
