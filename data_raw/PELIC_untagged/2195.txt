By accident picture of natural place stopped me while I was looking for an article in a magazine. That picture makes me reminisce my childhood. When I was a child I loved to collect pictures of natural places which rich with abundant green trees I do not know why Perhaps it is reaction from the area I used to live which is famous with a spacious golden sands and burning sunlight. That picture about a beautiful clear blue sky and a big mountain has a little amount of white snow speared in the side and summit and round it there are gorgeous light green hills. And front of the mountain there is a clear small lack which reflex the mountain Image in its surface which made combination of green gray white blue colors in the water. It a simple easy and quite scene makes you wants to be there breath the clean breeze and lie on the grass and forget every thing in the world. It is like a heaven in the earth.
