The advantage of the ELI at the University of Pittsburgh is effective curriculums to make improve English ability synthetically by balancing between English skills. Subjects of ELI consist of listening speaking grammar writing and reading. Each of subjects is very important as necessary skills in learning language because evenly learning all skills brings a comprehensive development of English ability. Moreover ELI helps English skills equally improve by teaching a skill to connect others not focusing on just one skill every class. For example in a writing class of ELI all students are required to read a text book and participate in discussion. Students also often learn grammar needed in writing. As every subjects are involved each other students can develop their English ability synthetically.
