English academic writing English academic writing is one of the most important subjects in college doctors like to read clear essays and creative by a lot of knowledge . In my experience English writing depends in three aspects that can improve academic writing Grammar vocabulary and Unity. First grammar is the key that can open the essay and make ideas clear . It can help the doctor to make a vegan about the essay and can assess the students skills. For instance if I am writing a presses essay I should have the ability to use past simple present perfect and present continues to can draw a big image in the readers mind. Grammar can control and organize the essay specially the process essay. Second the words that student choose in the essay reflects student background about what he is writing about also it reflects the attention of the details . For instance in the sentence It can help the doctor to make a vegan about the essay and can analyze the students skills I used assess instead of the word evaluate because it can demonstrate the same meaning but asses in my opinion is more appropriate. Finally the unity of the essay is what can make the doctor realize clearly the student skill of giving examples and definitions about the same topic . For example writing details are not relevant to the topic or the controlling idea can effect the essay negatively or be run on some times. Usually unity can help the reader to focus and enjoy the passage. IN conclusion English academic writing has to be clear by the GRAMMAR UNITY
