I worked for Royal Commission R. C for Jubail Industrial City. I worked in legal affairs department. One day my boss gave me a case about a man who is detinue of land that R. C usurped it. In addition he enclosed title deed with specific date. So he desired cost of rental for all years that R. C usurped his land. I studied the case and started collect official documents for R. C title deed and all the governmental decrees. Finally I found an official decree issued from the King ANON_NAME_0 third king of Saudi Arabia defined the borders of R. C and the date of this decree predated his title deed. Because that he loosed his case. After that this case became as reference for all similar cases.
