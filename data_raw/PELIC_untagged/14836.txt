There are many good restaurants in Pittsburgh. From different countries and vary culture and I tried many of them for example Chinas Italian Arabic and Indian restaurants. And I can't make obvious assess which the best one. However the Italian restaurants attract me that is for many thing. First of all the design of the restaurants is very beautiful it made me remember the restaurants in my country even the music it was very similar. Second the food was quite delicious and healthy. Third I ate new dish I have ever eaten. The good thing I ate many different dishes bread and vegetable soup pasta and fish. Also it was component olive oil that what I realy like. The restaurant was good place comfortable and cheap.
