My definition of success Most people have an own definition of success. For example earning a lot of money is a success to somebody or possessing an authority in company is able to be a final goal of somebody in life. In my case a definition of success is that if I feel satisfaction happiness or pleasure about something even if it's a small thing it's my success to me. In other words I think the standard of success is self satisfaction not something like wealth or honor. I don't look for a success to faraway places and just would like to find a meaning of success from my close things like feeling satisfaction of my job or environment. However the opinion of my family about success is different than mine. They somewhat tend to pursue wealth or honor while I prefer emotional things like happiness more than others. In our culture it is similar to the case of my family. People usually want to be a famous and make a lot of money. I am likely to believe that the standards of success are wealth and honors. However I realized if I only chase these things after all I won't be happy. Of course lots of money and honor are important to me and they also consider their feeling important and want to be happy and satisfied but I still think we have different goal and different meaning of success in our lives.
