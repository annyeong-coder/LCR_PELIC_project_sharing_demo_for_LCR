Before I moved here in U. S. A. I had never worn a bikini. I had been thinking of wearing it though but every time I had had chance to wear it I had been hesitated because I had been self conscious. As a matter of fact I had never bought it. However I've changed my mind because I saw many people was wearing it on the field in campus they were tanning. So I've thinking of wearing it and going to the Sandcastle located in Waterfront. I have not gone there yet but I'm planning to go there this summer with my friend Eun Jin.
