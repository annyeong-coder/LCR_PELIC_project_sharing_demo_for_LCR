In my case a friend is someone who is a swimmer or used to be a swimmer. One of my best friends who is living in Toronto was my rival for over 10 years. Even though we were competitors each other we became good friends. Another best friend whose name is Goon Hak was also a swimmer. Goon Hak who knows everything about me was my classmate in the elementary school. Since then we've been best friends. Kyung Soo who was my roommate in my high school's dormitory is still a swimmer. He isn't considering quitting swimming. We usually drink beer together. Therefore most of my best friends are related with swimming.
