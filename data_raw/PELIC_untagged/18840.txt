Think about vacation will be exciding about myself you know what I was really boring specially in the morning with grammar. I have been three plans to do after the semestre ends Stay Pittsburgh return to my country and go to New York. First of all I will need to stay in Pittburgh and will prepare my GMAT . Maybe if I study hard this month I can get it easily . However I chose Pittburgh because if you need to study you have to come there . It's the best place to live and peolple need to prepare their career. My second plan is to go back may country . I not hope that righ now but if I won't get my GMAT I have nothing to do here . It's preferable to go back and check a job I think it wiil easy to get there than here . For example It's cheaper for everything than here and get married . The last plan is going to New York. If I plan to go New York that's will be I go back to my country. Maybe spend one month in New City that's will be exiciting but I don't wanna do that plan. After thinking about my vacation I choose to stay and prepare my GMAT. I think it will be better for me to get my master degree before I go back.
