The Weather in Pittsburgh is Crazy The weather in Pittsburgh is both crazy and very amazing. For example in the summer you might see a lot of rains sometime in the morning the weather is hot and humid it and suddenly it start to rain cats and dogs. Once last summer when we were walking down to coffee shop the weather was good and sunny we have our coffee in that coffee shop the weather have changed completely and it started to rain. Moreover I was going to go back home after my classes were finished and in five to ten minutes very dark cloudy came up in the sky and its started to rain a lot. I had to run a way to find place where I could cover myself from getting wet. In the winter we can also see how the weather is really crazy and changeable too. Everybody remember that day two weeks ago that a lot of schools were closed and some of the university classes were canceled because the weather had changed in about one hour to bad snow and very low temperature of 0 which was terrible. We couldn't move outside our homes. It was horrible day. Moreover two or three day's ago we were in class and in the morning the weather was sunny and very beautiful suddenly everything had changed and it started to snow. Over all we could say that the weather is very crazy in Pittsburgh but I did like it.
