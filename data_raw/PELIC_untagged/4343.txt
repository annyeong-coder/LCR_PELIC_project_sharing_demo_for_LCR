I love to Xiang Cai Yuan it is one of the Chinese restaurants at CMU campus in Pittsburgh. The food in Xiang Cai Yuan is kind of spicy food it is from South of China. When I was a teenage I left home to the South area for studying. At the starting of learning in that city I could not enjoyed the food very much it is amazing because of the spicy food I hadn't eaten so much spicy food in my hometown I am so poor guy. But 3 years moved on I immediately loved spicy food at the end of my three years lifetime . It was a special experience so this restaurant in my favorite.
