I have been here for 3 years. When I came here I hadn't driver license. I couldn't drive. After one year I got a manual form State Office Building. I spent one month in studying the manual. I passed the permit test and got the permit. I could drive with my friend who have real driver license. Under my friend's help I can start a car back a car and drive a car on highway. I easily passed my test on road. I got my real driver license. Now I can legally drive in USA.
