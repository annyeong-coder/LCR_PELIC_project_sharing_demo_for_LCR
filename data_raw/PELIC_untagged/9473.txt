My name is ANON_NAME_0 Last Name . My family and friends usually call me Sissa and I like this nickname because ANON_NAME_0 sounds me too serious. I have two last names that are Batezati which comes from my mother and Alves which comes from my father. I am from Brazil and this year I am living and studying in Pittsburgh because I have some professional goals. First of all I am a medical doctor specifically an ENT doctor and I have worked in this field since 1999. In Brazil I work with patients who have ear diseases and I am developing a Ph. D. Thesis about patients who suffer from tinnitus. This word tinnitus describes a symptom of ear disease and usually people can tell that they are hearing a sound into their ears and this sound are not being generated in the environment it is a kind of phantom perception of sounds. It seems complicated and it is really! I need to read and write about this topic in English and that is the reason I am trying to improve my English skills. I need this period of the time here in Pittsburgh for two reasons improving my English and finishing my thesis. I have much time here because I am not working with patients and then I am available for studying
