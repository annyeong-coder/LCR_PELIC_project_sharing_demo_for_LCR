When I came to the U. S. I took on a small apartment. After that I went to a mall and I picked up some things for my apartment such as sofas tables and T V. I picked out some nice lights and put it away in my apartment. In addition I want to hang up some appropriate posters in the walls. I prefer to throw garbage away every day. Also when I watch T V I don't turn up the volume. Moreover I hope to touch the doors up in my apartment. I always clean up my apartment and straighten it up.
