Playing the Arpa My successful thing is playing the harp called Indian harp or Arpa. Arpa is the most famous instrument in Paraguay. Paraguay is one of the countries in South America. I started to learn how to play the Arpa when I was in Paraguay. When I went back to Japan in 1999 I kept on playing the Arpa every day for many hours. There weren't any teachers that taught Arpa around my house. In fact there are few people that teach or even play the Arpa in Japan. So I had to learn Arpa music from my mother. Arpa has beautiful cheerful and sometimes sad music. There are no scores for Arpa so we had to learn by hearing watching and playing the music. Playing the Arpa is difficult no scores or teachers is hard but I love playing the Arpa because it has a cheerful and sweet sounds that cheered me up. When I go back to Japan I will definitely play the Arpa as I love it so much.
