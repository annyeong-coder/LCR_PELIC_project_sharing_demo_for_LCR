Welcome to my website! Hi I'm Albert Minwoo Last Name . I built this website in 2003. Actually I've written this introducing page in English for one month. I've been playing soccer since 1993. When I was elementary school student my father got me play soccer. At first time I was really bad at controlling and shooting the ball. The only one thing that I was good at was running. After that my soccer skills were improved and I felt more fun. I've learned how to make a strong shoot and fast dribble. I've been practicing soccer especially shooting the ball. In this website you can see a lot of pictures and videos about international soccer game England and Spain soccer league and my favorite soccer players. One of my favorite soccer player is Christian Ronaldo. He grew up in Portugal and now he is playing soccer in England. I've been collecting his pictures and videos in my website for 3years. Lately I've included more pictures and videos of Christian Ronaldo. Please click on the button to continue next page.
