I didn't look for my cellphone when I wanted to call my husband yesterday. I thought I might have forgotten it somewhere. I tried to call my cellphone it could have been on my packbag. But I didn't hear its voice. I heard a strange voice from my cellpnone. I must have been lost my cellphone. The man might have picked it. He said he is a policeman. Someone picked it. I didn't have to worry for my cellphone. I should go to the police station to get my cellphone.
