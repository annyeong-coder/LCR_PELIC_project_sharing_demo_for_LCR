1 Try to be more close to him. 2 Try to know his a new group and talk with them. 3 Try to figure out why he changed . Dear Concerned . There are many things you can do it for your roomate. First you should try to become more close to him you have to know every thing happened to your roomate. Second you have to know his a new group to be aware how they think. Also try to figure out why he changed. For example if you fought with him before or you did not talk with him try to solve any thing wrong between you. Finally if you are going to do the steps above I think every thing will be good.
