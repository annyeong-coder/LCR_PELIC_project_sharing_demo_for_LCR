I would like to talk about my best friend Hae ANON_NAME_0 kim who lives in Busan Korea. When we were about 10 year old we were living in same town in Busan. And we met in bible school. While she was playing piano in church I saw her first time. We attended the same elementary school middle school high school and church. We were always together. So even when she didn't say anything I was able to understand her. For example when she was considering hanging out I suggested that we watch movie or have dinner. In addition when I was living in Seoul after graduating school she often visited me. And we spent summer vacations together every year. She is my best friend and my family.
