I think it is not a good idea to raise and keep an animal that normally lives in the wild. These kinds of animals need their own habitat to live in. Sometimes people feel attracted to the idea of raising and keeping wild animals because of their personalities. In this lecture Grimaud's feels this kind of attraction with her wolves. She thinks that They want to be alone and she describes herself as a loner person . The wolves' behavior and the Grimaud's personality are connected. I Think wild animals deserve to enjoy the freedom just like humans.
