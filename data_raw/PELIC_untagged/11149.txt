There is a differents between my life in the USA and my life in my country. In my country I taught in the University but here I study English language . Also I had a car in my country and I did not take the buses but here I don't have a car and I usually take the buses . In my country I lived with my mother and my brothers but in Pittsburgh I live with my small family my wife and my children. Also I went to natural places in my country but in the USA I just stay in Pittsburgh. Also in Libya I usually watch Arabic channels but here I watch English channels. So I am very happy because I am learning foreign language and I am making new friends from different countrys.
