What was I going to do in three day weekend in the US I could do like most of the Americans having a barbecue with my friends in a park. I preferred to do something new. There for I planed to visit my friend in State College. Unfortunately none of this happened in the three days. The past Saturday was one of my most miserable days in Pittsburgh. I was exited when I woke up so I went with my cousin to have a breakfast in a restaurant near his apartment. After that my day crashed down. When I went back home I started feeling a really bad stomachache. I could not even breathe well so I called my friend to tell him I am not coming. I spent the rest of the day at home. Sunday was pretty similar to the previous day. I stayed at home for most of the day but instead of stomachache it became diarrhea. Finally at the end of the day I started feeling better so I invited some of my friends to see a soccer match between the Canadian and the Saudi teams. After two miserable days Monday was the best ever. I felt fine when I woke up so I decided to take a walk in North Park. More than ever before I was happy to walk in a park. Later I invited my friends to enjoy it with me. We played soccer and had a picnic. We stayed there to see the sunset and went back home after that. Three day weekend provide people with extra time off. Unfortunately I could not enjoy all the weekend. I got sick on Saturday so I stayed at home on Sunday my friends and I watched soccer match and had so much fun and grilled in the North Park on Monday. My memorial day was great. I substituted the two miserable days with one awesome day. I wish every weekend could be a three day weekend but without illness.
