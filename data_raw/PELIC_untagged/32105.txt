Some scientist discover that online shopping is bad for the environment. They said one of the reason is online shopping is wasteful and it also cause more air pollution. Some people buy heavy products and get next day delivery which require to send by airplanes. However airplanes consume a lot fuel more than cars. In addition airplanes produce more air pollution. When people ask for next day delivery it increase the number of traveled airplanes which cause much pollution for the environment and get it worse. To be honest these information surprised me but it changes my opinion about online shopping. So I will try to avoid online shopping as much as I can. If it is so important to shop online I will ask for normal delivery duration. Normal delivery also has a benefit which save money.
