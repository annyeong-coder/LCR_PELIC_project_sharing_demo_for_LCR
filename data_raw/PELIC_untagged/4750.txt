The benefits of learning English One of the most essential ways to open to the world is learning a new language. Learning a new language and especially the English is so important because of the so many benefits you would acquire such as using the modern technology gaining more experience and communicating with people around the world since English is the most common understandable language among so many countries. Using the technology requires the people who understand and deal with the English language. For example the Internet if you do not know English you often can not use the Internet and the services that are given such as the email search for something and knowing the news in the world. Therefore the technology whether in the Internet or in the other fields demand learning English. The second reason of learning English is to have more experience in the life. For instance usually if you want to have a job one of the questions you are asked is if you speak another language and especially English. Also you will have more experience in other fields such as when you meet new friends and when you travel to any country around the world. The third incentive of learning English is to communicate with the people around the world. For example traveling and studying. When I came to the United States to study I knew exactly what the benefits of learning English is and how it is so important to be able to understand English when you are traveling and studying. Therefore traveling and studying are two types of communicating with other people but there are so many others such as having a new job and meeting new people. Finally I think that learning English will be ongoing and developed in all countries around the world. I think also that the advantages of learning English will increase more than using the technology and having more experience in communicating with people.
