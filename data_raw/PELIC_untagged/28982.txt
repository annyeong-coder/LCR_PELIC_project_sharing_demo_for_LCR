Everyone like to speak foreign language well. To achieve their target students sometimes talk about a good way to learn a new language fast. Learning languages depond on speaking and listening skills. I believe It's necessary to travel to the country where a language is spoken in order to truly learn the language because traveling help you to speak with native speakers and listen to native speakers. First traveling help you to find native speaking friends join to conversation group. Living in foreign country assess you to go out with your friend for coffee and only speak a language which learn to each other. Second traveling help you to listen to people everywhere in school in in homestay in resturant and street. Listening to native speakers assess you to understand and learn quickly. Some students may learn foreign language in their country . Also some students speak foreign language without traveling. I understand that learning any language can be frustrating and students prefer staying and studing near their families. I agree some students can speak and chieve a new language from their home . If they study in their home they will have alot of problems with pronunciation and listening skills. They may learn but they take along time and they still have the problem. In conclusion I think that students shuld travel to the country where a language is spoken in order to have agood learning with a short time . Students who can travel will find a good way to a chieve foreign language.
