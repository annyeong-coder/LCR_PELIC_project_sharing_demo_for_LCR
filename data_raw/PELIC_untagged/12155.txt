In writing class the teacher wanted me to write about comparison and contrast essey. So I thought what is good topic for the essay. I decided to write about my two daughters Lucia 20years and Christina 16years They have some similarities and differentcies although I has raised them equally. At first in their appearance they look alike. They are both 5'6 tall skinny long hair and 100lb weigh. Their voices are the almost same. Moreover their hobbies are similar. They both are interested in music art travel. They looked very similar at first glance but there are several differences Lucia and Christina. At first Lucia likes to eat meats. In contrast Christina likes vegetables. Even though their hair style and skin look similar their interest about appearance are different. Christina is very interested in her appearance so she spend a lot of time in choosing hair products and cosmetics unlike Lucia. Their hobbies are similar but they are different in their approaching them. Lucia is passive on the other hand Christina active. Christina like to play the piano draw the picture. However Lucia love to listen the music and like to appreciate the painting. They look same at glance but they totally different their emotional by nature.
