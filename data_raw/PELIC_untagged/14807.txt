The benefits of having pets In my opinion I think having pets brings out plenty of benefits in our life. First of all especially family having kids pets make us feel rich emotion. We share emotion with our pets like one of our family. Second pets teach us that life is how valuable. By raising pets kids can learn death and life. For instance when a dog gives a birth kids can show all process of birth. Third pet can be good friend. If you are senior and you live alone pets would be a best conversation partner. Thus I insist you have pets.
