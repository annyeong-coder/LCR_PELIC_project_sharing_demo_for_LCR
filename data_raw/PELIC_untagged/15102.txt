While I was studying in Pittsburgh I met my Friend Daniel. Daniel has come to do master degree in CMU. After we met couple week Danilal and me decided to get on new apartment with 2 more good friends. When we moved to new apartment My Language School was still continuing. We have been living together as good friends in the some house. We are happy that we have decided to move this place because of this location's distance to the school.
