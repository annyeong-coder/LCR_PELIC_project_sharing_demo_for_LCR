1 I think it is important for parents to pass on cooking skills to their children. Because various foods we should have everyday are very significant for all of us. A human body always need the nutritions of good quality. In order to keep normal health I think we must have the fresh dishes which parents just make at home rightly. Parents put their heart into the food that they cook. These dishes can't compare with the ready made or fast food. Therefore about to pass on cooking skills to their children parents has to understand how important this is.
