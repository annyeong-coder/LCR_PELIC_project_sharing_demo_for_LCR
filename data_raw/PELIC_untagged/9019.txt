When I graduated from the university I had a conflict whether I should apply to a graduate school or go to a company. After thinking carefully I decided to work at a company. However after three years later I applied to the graduate school in order to be a teacher. In the event I spent three years. I should have applied to the graduate school directly after graduating from the university. I should not have gone to the company. I should have thought about my job and future more carefully. At that time I had many seniors who had the similar experience as mine. I could have asked them to advise me. Also I could have changed my course earlier. I should not have hesitated to enter the graduate school.
