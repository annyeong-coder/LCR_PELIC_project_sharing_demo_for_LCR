I think research advances justify the use of animal testing. First of all without animal testing we cannot develop safer new medicines with current technology. For instance you cannot test a new medicine human first without knowing its safety evaluation so animal testing is an essential step before clinical trial. In addition animal testing in pharmaceutical industry at least is under strict regulation so that there is no meaningless animal testing. In fact since Food and Drug Administration FDA regulates all developing medicine testings including animal testing with strict documentation requirements researcher cannot waste any testing animals. Finally animal testing is not cruel despite of PETA's description. When I worked for a pharmaceutical company as an animal testing researcher there was a special funeral ceremony for tested animals every year. All researchers attended the ceremony and thanked them. In my opinion animal testing is acceptable due to research advances.
