My bedroom is not big but it possesses all its necessary furniture. After I finish my classes and come back home I like to rest in my room. I can do whatever I want to do. Therefore it let me feel comfortable and cheer me up. There is a big window in my room and I hang on transparent curtains. Also I pick out white color to paint walls. Therefore it shows up not dim. I sometimes clean up it without a fixed schedule. Before I make thorough cleaning it looks like in a mess. I take away some reading and put them in order. In addition I throw away some garbage. In addition I have lots of CD and VCD but I do not have enough shelves. In order to work out the problem my sister helps me buy it. In conclusion I want to change the style of my room. I fit up some cute pictures o to make it livelier. Then I probably install a TV I can sit on the sofa and enjoy watching TV program.
