I have read an interesting story called The Circuit . The story tells about a family who lives in a poor village in Mexico. The family has 4 members that are a father mother child who is the storyteller and a young baby. What the story describes is that the family decides to change their status. The father suggests that the whole family travels to California in order to work in exchange for money. One day the family sets off to California where they can find a job. When they reache the Mexico Clifornia border they attempt to enter the USA illegally. Many attempts are made. Finally they manage to get into the USA. As soon as they enter the USA they meet a woman who arranges the trip for the family in exchange for some money. When the family arrives at a labor camp where the father will work they are shocked that there are no jobs available. The family is concerned about how they work. The woman who drives the family from the border asks the father to wait until the work is ready. What happens is that the father is so frustrated because it is not what he has been promised by the woman to find a job there. After long waiting the father starts working in the labor camp that has cotton fields. The father and the mother whose a baby is 1 year old collect cottons from the fields. At sunset the family gathers and see how much cotton they have collected so that they get money in exchange. Day by day the family is better off and in stable situation. The storyteller is Francisco Jimenez who is currently the Fay Boyle Professor in the Department of Modern Languages and Literatures at Santa Clara University.
