Movie Review The movie Confession of a shopaholic wrote by Tracy Jackson and Tim Firth was a success it is a romantic comedy that girls can easily relate too and enjoy. The director who I didn't previously know did a good job as well as both main characters whom were also great. The film takes place in he city of New York and it shows the story of a girl who loved to shop and was seriously behind in the payment of her credit cards. She losses her job and end up being engaged by an economic magazine to advice people on their personal finances. She falls in love with her boss who forgives her for not being honest and he end up together.
