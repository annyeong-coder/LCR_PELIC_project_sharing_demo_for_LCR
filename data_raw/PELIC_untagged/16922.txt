The story is about an 18 year old student ANON_NAME_0 who will graduate soon from the high school. His father who is working in the military service wants him to join the military service. There is no rational reason about the father opinion. Just because the father and the grand father have joined the military service the son should be inherently an army officer. ANON_NAME_0 is a polite and smart person. He does not like the hard work in the military. It is crucial for him to be an artist but he is reluctant to do that because he does not want to disappoint his father expectations. However it very difficult for him to join the army just to satisfy his father wishes.
