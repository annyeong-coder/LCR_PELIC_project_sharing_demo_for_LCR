When I stepped into the US I suddenly found that my interest was to learn English. So now I am studying English here at ELI. I plan to learn English until I can speak fluently listen and understand exactly and write in English with American way not write with Chinese English way that often have teachers confuse what I write about. I always change my plan according my need. But my hobbies do not change often. I like fishing shopping cooking and going to internet.
