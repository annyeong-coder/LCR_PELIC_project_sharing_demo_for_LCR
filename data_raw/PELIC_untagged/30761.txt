When I was a child I grew up with my parents in a beautiful house which was located in Riyadh the capital city of Saudi Arabia. Last year when parents decided to move two a new house which is close to my aunts and uncles house everyone agree with this decision. The new neighborhood is much better than where I lived when I was a child. The new neighborhood that we call it Gulf district is located in the south area in Riyadh where the King ANON_NAME_0 stadium is located. Also my sister whose son name is Othman her house is close to us as well. Everyone in that neighborhood is friendly and modest.
