I think that the important thing to me is a colleague relationship. I met a good coworker while I was working in a company. She was a nice person and she taught me a lot when I had problems. In addition we helped each other when we took charge of a big project. Therefore the project could be completed successfully. If I asked for sick leave she covered my work to finish it. I also gave an assistant to her when she took a long leave of absence. We often discussed the context of work and exchanged opinions. In the leisure time we traveled or went window shopping together. I miss her while I am living in Pittsburgh. I hope that I can see her when I go back to my country.
