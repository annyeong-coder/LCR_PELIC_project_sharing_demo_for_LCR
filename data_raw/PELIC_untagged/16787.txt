I met my boyfriend Thiago while I was in Downtown the place that I live. I discovered that he is brasilian like me. We talked a lot of things about both countries and personal opinions. He did great things to catch my attention. He invited me to dinner and hung out for nice places. After 2 months we started a relationship and today we completed 6 months together. I'm so happy to met him.
