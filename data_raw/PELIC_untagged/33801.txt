The WHO celebrated the early achievement of brining improved drinking water to improve health and quality of life for people who live in the world. According to the research many people are exposed to water pollution. One report analyzed water quality test data from five countries concluded that many sources of improved water were not improved for real. Estimated figures show that people should pay attention to understand and manage drinking water safety. Unclear water causes diarrheal disease which is a major cause of childhood mortality. It can be preventable by improved water but leads to high environmental cleanup costs which is a burden on economy. Collecting data from improved sources is easier than performing formal water quality tests however this is not objective. If even though safe water resources are established it is difficult to maintain these improvements over time. So we should consider not only installation of water improvement facilities but also their maintenance. Also water is likely to be contaminated while it flows into homes through pipe lines. This can be solved by water pipes installed closer to homes. Although standard water sample tests need to be kept cool it is almost impossible in many developing countries because of poor experimental conditions. Many groups are trying to find alternatives but they need to get much more evaluations to earn trust. Improved measurements of water sources are the best indicators until now in spite of their disadvantageous. Instead of repairing old pipes developing communities focus on installing new infrastructures to get high effectiveness but these are much scarcer than actual needs. The need for clean water is obvious to everybody but proper sanitations are poor. Moreover improvement sanitations for safe drinking water is going to take too long time because of financial problems.
