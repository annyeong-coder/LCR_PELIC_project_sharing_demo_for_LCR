I especially like my apartment here in pitt. When we came to the US and had to pick out an appropriate apartment for me and my husband. The first appointment we had to put off with the owner of the apartment because he was sick. After he recovered we look the apartment over and we were surprised how nice it was. We felt comfortable at the first sight. We just had to sign up a contract for one year without paying a fee. My husband and I were lucky because everything was straightened up. So we just had to put up some pictures. We set up a new TV in the living room. Sometimes my neighbours turn on their TV very loud and we ask them to turn it down because it bothers us. We call them to it talk over. But they never called back and therefore we do not go along with them.
