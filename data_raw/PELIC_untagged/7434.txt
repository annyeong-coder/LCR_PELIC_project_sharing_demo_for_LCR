When I was junior of university my professor gave me a complimentary ticket of play. But the ticket was past date. My professor told me it would be okay. I think my professor should have given me earlier. I went to theatre and than I had ticket thing. Finally I saw last present. I was full and little disappointed. Although the play was last present audience were fifteen more then less. The play was very funny and great. After that I wanted to buy a pamphlet. But it was sold out as last play. So I brought another pamphlet squarely next me. After came home I knew the pamphlet was on selling 30. For some reason when I picked up the pamphlet I saw people took one's purse out of their pocket. I should have asked them. I think I was very squarely they didn't ask me. But the pamphlet was very useful for me. I should never have been same happen again.
