I met my friend ANON_NAME_0 while I was studying in high school. When we graduated from the high school we moved to Riyadh because of presence of our university there. He was studying in mechanical engineering department while I was studying in chemical engineering department. We were living together in the same apartment. This friendship led to that he got married my sister and I got married his sister. He became like my brother I know all his secrets and he too. When we sit together we remember a lot of events that happened when we were in school or university.
