I am able to cook in my kitchen because there are many kitchen utensils. Like most kitchens it is a rectangle. As you enter my kitchen through the door the first thing you notice is the large window on the back wall. The sink is to the left of the door. The table is under the window. Various fruits are on the table. Next to the table in the right corner is refrigerator which is lined with many foods. Therefore I can pick some food into the refrigerator while I have a meal. The oven is on the middle of the left wall. Between the oven and the sink in the right corner is the shelf which fills with a lot of ingredients. The pots are inside the sink. Next to refrigerator to the right of the door is another shelf. In the middle of the room there is a polyurethane rug my host mother bought in IKEA last weekend.
