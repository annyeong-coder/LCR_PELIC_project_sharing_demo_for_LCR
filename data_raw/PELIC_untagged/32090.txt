Why online shopping is bad for the environment wasteful air pollution My opinion disagree Reasons In fact my reasons according to my hometown and air pollution so I say disagree. Taiwan is my hometown and ground of Taiwan is smaller than the ground of U. S in Taiwan post offices deliveries productions by trucks motorcycle. For instance I used to shop on website and I could compare price with other shops in the meanwhile and I did not drive to everywhere so I thought that was a good way for save fuel due to I save fuel so I could reduce air population and carbon dioxide the other reason is transportation each people goes to outside they have to drive each car or motorcycle they waste much fuel and quantity of wasteful fuel is much more than one truck such as government encourage people take bus and less drive by themselves we could use fuel for one bus is better than ten or more small cars. To sum up I think shop on website is not bed for the environment.
