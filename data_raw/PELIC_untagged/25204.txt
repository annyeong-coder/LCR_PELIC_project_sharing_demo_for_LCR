That day was a sunny day when I first met her. She is from Pintung. She carried a big backpack and looked very upset. She tried to ask me where the university is. We stayed in the same school same dormitory. I invited her to have a cup of coffee with me and I can took her to look around. I took her to the store to buy some grocery. She was very nervous about the new school. It was a very sunny day but the weather changed so fast. We went to the nearest coffee shop and we had another coffee. She talked a lot about her hometown about how terrible about living in a new city and she was so surprised about the people there. So here is how I met my best friend
