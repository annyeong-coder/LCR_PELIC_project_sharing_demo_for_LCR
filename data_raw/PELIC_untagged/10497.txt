I have been living in Shadyside for almost six months. Six months ago I moved into my apartment which is across Giant Eagle I let me down because my room was too dingy and small. It makes me sleepy and brings me down. I have been living with these problems for six months. So I wanted to move out of my apartment but I gave up moving my apartment. I have been looking for solution about the problem since last week. Also I talked it over with my friends and through these problems last Sunday. We found several solutions. First I will set up more lights. They will make my room light up. I plan to pick them up at IKEA this Saturday. Next I will take away a book case. The book case is too tall and is covered with window so it causes a dark room. In addition it takes up too much space so it makes look my room small. Finally I will put away my busy stuffs and turn around some furniture. Maybe I could use larger space than before through this renovation. I believe that this work will make cheer me up.
