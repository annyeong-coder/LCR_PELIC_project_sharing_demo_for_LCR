Hi guys. I've been building this site for several weeks. It is my first time to come to united state. I have been preparing myself to live in Pittsburgh for a long time. I like summer wherever I stay therefore I have bought many t shirts and sandals before I came here. Since I graduated from university I have never seen a movie in theatre. I like downloading a film from internet . I never cooked a meal before coming here. I have learned some recipe since one month ago.
