Many people may think that food of the wild in Africa must worse than in the cities in U. S because the living conditions are significant different. However according to the researches college students might lead a more unhealthy life than !Kung people who live in Kalahari Desert. For example the !Kung people can hunt many kinds of animals for enough proteins cultivate crops for their staple and gather various vegetables and fruits. However almost the college students in U. S. Are eating unhealthy food such as McDonald's and Cereals for their main dining everyday. This is a very incredible phenomenon in these two groups. Food you eat can provide you nutrition however it might also cause healthy problems if you don't eat appropriately. For example the food that !Kung people eat is gathered directly from the nature and it couldn't be added any unhealthy chemical nutrition. On the contrary the college students eat unhealthy food everyday and also eat too many sugars fat and of course unhealthy chemical substances. Eating too much sugars and fat as we know probably cause many diseases such as heart failure and high blood pressures. Therefore in my opinion the !Kung people might consume more healthy food then the college students do in U. S. That's very funny.
