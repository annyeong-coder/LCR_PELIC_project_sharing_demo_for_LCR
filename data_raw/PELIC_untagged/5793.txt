Before I moved to Pittsburgh I had never played frisby. I moved to this beautiful city nearly one month ago. Before I moved to Pittsburgh I had been living in Turkey. Generally people don't know how to play frisby in my country. We went to Schenley Park with my friend last weekend. Before we played frisby we had watched the tournament of frisby in Schenley Park. I had never watched a frisby tournament before. My friend whose name is ANON_NAME_0 taught us how to play it. Before last weekend I had thought that playing frisby was very easy. What I would like emphasize here is that it is very hard and learning play frisby takes a very long time.
