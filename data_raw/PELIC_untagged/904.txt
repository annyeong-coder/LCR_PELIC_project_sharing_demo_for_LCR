Do you and you friend must be in the some level I don't think so. My best friend is ANON_NAME_0 who I'll talk about. He isn't from the same city which I am from. He is from ALdwadmi which closes to the capital city in Saudi Arabia. He is bigger then me. Fore years between me and him and we are friend. We lived in the same apartment where our fathers lived. We grew up in the same city which is Jeddah and we got friend after me family hanged out with his family. We have the same hobbies which are playing soccer video games and cards which his favored game. When I went to Saudi Arabia list vacation which was in Jon. I saw ANON_NAME_1 whom is ANON_NAME_0's brother. He told me how his brother feels when I left him. It is right ANON_NAME_0 is bigger than me but we have the same interests and we like each other. We are good friend.
