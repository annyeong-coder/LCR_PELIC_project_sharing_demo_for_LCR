My older brother is a prospective bridegroom. First he is very handsome. Almost girl fall in love to him since meet first time. Next he has good weight. He hasn't too much fat and skinny. And he has a good height. He is a high stature. In addition he has smooth and soft skin. He looks very good. Now it's time about his personality. First of all he has a large income. Because he works at a good company. He has ability and plenty of money to go with it. Next he is an angel of a man. When I tired and sad recognize next to me. Then while talk to him and I am comfortable. So when I have a troble talk with him and delete. For these reasons My brother is very good guy and very popular with girl. So I have a great envy of his all things.
