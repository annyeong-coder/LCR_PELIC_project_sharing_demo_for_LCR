Most of countreis around the world people take days off. In some countreis this days are sundays in others are fridays or saturdays . From the day which I come to the US until this day some my hobbies are changed because when I came to the US the day off is sunday but it was friday while I was staying in Saudia Arabia. It is obvious that my philosoph in my live has been changing since I came to the U. S. There are no justification to make comparesion and contrast between sunday and friday attributes in my lives. In sunday I usually make this day special for my family . We always go shoping on this day. Also sunday is a good chance to have strong relationship with my relevants. However Sunday night is the time which I specific it to prepare myself for the next work day . On the other hand Friday is the very important day in my live . On friday I often meet my friends on my home or the home of anyone of us . Since we access untill we leave we have conversations about our countreis and our interests. Friday is a chance to enhance my frindships here in the U. S. In sum each day in our lives has a special attribute . So it is crucial to exploite our times in good way . Friday and sunday are not same for everyone but we have to know how can we get benefits from them.
