If I have a lot of money I would go the universe. My dream when I was young is going to universe. But when I grow up I realized that It is impossible. Because I need very much and a lot of money for go to universe. If I'll have my dream's job what is the most famous designer in the world I can't much money to go there. When I have much money able to go universe I'm maybe about 50 years or older than that. For going to universe I need to have the great health too. But when I'm 50 years I won't have the good health. So I can't go there in the real space. However If I have the money that I can go the universe when I'm young age like now I definitely go there. Maybe I had gone now!
