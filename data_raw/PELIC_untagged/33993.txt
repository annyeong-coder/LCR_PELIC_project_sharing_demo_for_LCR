The quote that talks about a true friend is somebody who can make us do what we can I think means that a good friend is someone who can push us to do things and work hard together. It is not easy to make ourself do what we don't like to do. I also agree with this quote a true friend is someone who can do a thing what we can't do. True friends like star that shines in the sky whether they are bright or dim. My best friend Nancy in China was like that. Nancy whom I got along with always helped me when I was feeling bad at the office. She was someone who I can share the secret with and she can keep the secret for me.
