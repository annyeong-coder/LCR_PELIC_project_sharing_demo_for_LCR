Living in America and Taiwan are totally different for me. When I just arrived to America I spend almost one month to overcome those problem. The weather is the most different thing I have learned. Due to the difference in geography and latitudes the weather in Pittsburgh and in Taichung has huge different in several way including four seasons. First of all Taichung lies in an island controlling by oceans that makes it very humid. For example summer is the hottest season that the temperature will get almost 40 degree Celsius. Because of the humidity people will very uncomfortable and sticky all the time. In the other hand summer in Pittsburgh is also very hot but rarely to sweating because of the climate is dry. Even though in the same temperature Pittsburgh is cooler than Taichung. Secondly as a result of ocean controlling typhoon is a common phenomenon during summer time in Taichung. It is always bring the storm big raining and wind which damage the entire city. Sometimes it solves the drawt problem but most of that is flood damage. Typhoon and hurricane is almost the same but has different names so that it did not scare me when I saw it in Pittsburgh. Therefore people in Taichung always get one day off during the typhoon coming but in Pittsburgh they do not. Due to this reason I like the harsh time in Taichung more than in Pittsburgh. I am glad that I have a chance to live to different countries and cities so that I can have different experiences.
