A breath of Korea Sam Chung Dong is the last area that well preserved from the Capital city Seoul's civilization. Unlike Seoul's downtown there are no big buildings or noise. Although it is located right next to Seoul's downtown it remains as a little oasis for many Seoul citizens. If you once step into this area you could feel a breath of ancient Korea. Its atmosphere is Korea's scent. There are several Korean traditional houses and small gardens with bamboo trees. Also a curve of the eaves and smell of the green tea make the aura of the authentic Korea. In summer night often they have a small Korean Classic music concert and offer a free gallery tour with traditional tea. In spite of there is no magnificent sight it gives the only distinctive feelings.
