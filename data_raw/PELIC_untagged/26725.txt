It's hard to have good relationships that will continue your life with it. It's important to have but it's hard to find. One of my best relationships is my high school classmates. From the first year in the high school we are together. We are 21 students who lived in the same class for more than four years. We finished the high school know and most of them separated from each other. But I continued with my best friend and we entered the ELI together. In my country we are always together in everything in the life we help each other in our problems that we face spent all our time together playing swimming and travel together. I hope that we continue together all the life because I don't think that I will find best than these friends.
