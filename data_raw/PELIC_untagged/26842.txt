In the last summer when I was in US I used to watch movies every Friday. One of the best movies which I have seen is A Tall Dark Stranger directed by Josh Brolin. The film has professional actors most of whome are stars. The movie was mixed including comodey and action. I watched the movies many times since it has good features.
