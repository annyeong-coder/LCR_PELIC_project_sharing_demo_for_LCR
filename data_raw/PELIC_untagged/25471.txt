When I was in high school I used to play soccer everyday with my friends. All my friends used to visit me every week to have a diner together. I know many people who like to bike a bicycle but I never used to bike it. These days I like to drink coffee every morning but when I was in high school I used to drink it at night. My father used to ask me about my homework for this reason I become very careful with homework.
