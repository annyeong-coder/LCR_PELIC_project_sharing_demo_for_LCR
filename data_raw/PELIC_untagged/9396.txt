When I was in high school on time I went shopping by bicycle and when I was on my way home I rode a wrong road on which bicycle is not allowed. Weather was rainy at that time and road was slipery. Suddenly a car appeared from a cross I failed to avoid it and was hit I think I wasn't got wounded because I can feel no pain at that time but not so lucky of my bicycle. It was baddly damaged especially the wheels one of them became ellips. The driver quickly come out but he seemed not so care about my wound. I was blamed by him for my violating the law. Felt sigh as well so I apologized to him with a ellips shape wheel bicycle. I felt up and down up and down when I roding. However I found my leg unmovable when I got home and I was sent to the hospital by my father. I took a x ray picture and was found frature. After that I had spent more than 2 month on bed. The most interesting point in the whole accident is that a person was hit by a car but the car driver blamed that person and that person apologized to the car driver without any compansation request.
