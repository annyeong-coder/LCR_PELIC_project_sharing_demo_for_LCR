I have one teacher I won't forget until I die. I met him in my 7th grade. He had his own strict standard. So honestly he beat me so many times to lead me in a good way. I know you would be shocked by the fact that I'm appreciating for the guy who used to beat me. However it sometimes happens in Korea. He suggested me that I try to manage my time efficiently. He definitely knew that Time management is a key factor to get a good grade. Most of all he taught me the reason why I should study. Although he made me so annoyed since he requested me that I not sleep much during test terms I still thank him for directing me right.
