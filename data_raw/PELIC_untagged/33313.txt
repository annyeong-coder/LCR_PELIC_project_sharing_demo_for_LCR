The Villages are customized for senior citizens which contain the facility and verious activities. Even though elders can enjoy the rest of their life in there without disturbing from their children from my perspactive I would not like to live in the similar village. There are three main reasons why I dislike it. Firstly I want to be involved with young in order to catch up with new things. Living in the village will isolate me from outside sociaty. Secondly I prefer live with my children if they prefer too because we can take care each other. One positive aspect of living with children is lving with hope. I can experience the change of my family. Thirdly I am afraid to livng with same age groups who are living on sunset time. It will make me feel upset when peole living around pass away. Therefre It is not a good idea for me to live in the village. I will educate my children to have the same concept then I can enjoy my life with them.
