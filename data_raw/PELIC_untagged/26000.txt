My friend is going to visit Cozumel. This is a beautiful island located in the Gulf of Mexico. He had better stay there at least two weeks. He should go there with some friends. He likes scuba diving so he ought to take a tour. He has a license to scuba dive so he had better not forget to take his license on the trip. He likes sea mammals so he shouldn't miss the great opportunity to swim with dolphins.
