Drugs Drugs are the most common disease that destroys person's life. Drugs affect the person's life and ruin it. The causes that lead to this problem are his family the person personality and the community. The family is the most important level that the child takes everything from it. The bad methods that the parents use usually lead to negative results. So the careless raising and the lack of monitoring of the children lead them to go the wrong way and it's mostly results in trying drugs. The second important thing is the person's personality. And how he chooses his friends is also very important. As everybody knows the friend is the mirror of his friend in front of other people. Therefore every person should choose the right friend. If the person chose the right friend he will be so far from these bad things. Finally the community has also a major role by providing more ideal model school classes. Therefore the student will know the effects of drugs so they can avoid it. And to give more attention to the media by showing short clips of previous drug addicts to give advice not to try or to be near drugs. I think that the drugs are common diseases that affect many people and lead them to the wrong direction. I hope that every family takes care of their children and every person must choose his friends wisely because they will help him during his journey in life.
