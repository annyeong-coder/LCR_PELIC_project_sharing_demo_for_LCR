There are several advices I can give it to a new student in ELI to help them in the future. The most important thing you have to feel free and don't be afraid of asking question. Second do your homework very well and don't copy it from your partner. Third study hard all lessons to take a good score. Also don't miss your classes or come late because If you do it you will miss some information maybe It could be very important. I hope this advice will help a new student to do well.
