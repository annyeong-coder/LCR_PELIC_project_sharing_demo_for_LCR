Helen Adams Keller was the people who I most respect because she had very hardy soul and mind. She was born in June 27 in 1880. She was blinded and deaf after a fever when she was eighteen months. Even though she was not able to see anything and was not able to hear any voice but she never gave up her life. After learning she could use sign language communicant with people. Finally she also could speak the language. And she got master degree from the Harvard University in 1894. She was an excellent writer and social activist.
