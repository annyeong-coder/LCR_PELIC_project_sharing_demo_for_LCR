Before I saw Les Miserables by attending ELI activities I had been intending to purchase a ticket. However I forgot the date. Therefore I called my friend up when I got my home. Luckily when I called my friend up she was purchasing a ticket. I asked her for a ticket instead of me. She said to hold on and she hung up. I called her back in a few minutes. Finally she signed up the list of names. I talked about the performance with her and I hung up.
