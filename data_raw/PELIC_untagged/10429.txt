My bedroom cheers me up because it is bright and sunny during the day. On the other hand my bedroom is a little bit darker at night so my husband and I cannot enjoy reading at night as much as we want. Because of this my husband and I went to the store and we picked up two reading lamps but they did not work out either. Now we are trying to figure out what can we do next. Also we decided to paint the room but some of the walls were dirty and they had some cracks. So we touched them up before we painted the bedroom with brownish colors. We like it a lot because it matches with the bedroom's furniture. The color of the walls turned out beautiful. The other thing we didn't like about our bedroom was the carpet because it was really old. In December Home Depot workers came to my house and tore the old carpet out. Then they put in the new carpet. After they finished we asked them to move the furniture back into the room. We want to do other changes to our bedroom. For example we want to hang up some pictures and I want to make up new curtains. My husband thinks that we should leave the curtains on. I think that we should take them down and I do not want to give up! Anyway we are very happy because our bedroom is straightened up.
