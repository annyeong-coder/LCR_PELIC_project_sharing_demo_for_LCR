When it's times to pick baby's name there are two kinds of parents. There are parents who choose common names and parents who choose unusual names for their children. Some people believe that unusual names can affect in the child in many different aspect. From my perspective I think names cannot be an influential to the child life. If parents choose unusual names for their children they should tech them that names must not affect in them. The most crucial is their personality. Its parent's responsibility to raise their children will. For example bullying in school may make them easy to bully. However if they have self esteem they will not affect in them at all. Unusual names are more fashionable nowadays. Children are fight to pick for themselves another unusual name. They like to be special or to mimic famous people ways.
