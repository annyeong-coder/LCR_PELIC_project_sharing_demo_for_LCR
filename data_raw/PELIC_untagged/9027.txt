I have a lovely sister who works at a bank in Korea. She is two years younger than me but she is as tall as me. Of course she is lighter than me in weight. Then she looks younger than her real age I think it is because of history of our family. Actually my all family memebs including me have a young face. Next she has splendid long black hair. Also she often likes change her hair style. So she sometimes has big wavy long hair or sometimes has straight long hair. In addition to she has big eyes and double edged eyelids unlike me. Moreover she has bright skin color and good smile. Therefore People who have ever seen think that she is feminine and benevolent. However I know that she is not as affectionate as her appearance. First of all she is selfish and doesn't take a conciliatory attitude to me. Especially she sticks to food so we sometimes squabble. Once someone came my home buying Haagen Dazs Vanila ice cream and we put it on our refrigerator. At that time I had no time to eat it because I must go out to finish something. I was only thinking the ice cream while I went out. However I didn't eat it because my sister eat it all. I was really angry and ask for her about it. Then she said Why didn't you eat it before I eat it . On the contrary she sometimes make me laugh because she mishear what I say. Once I ask for her Do you try cheese snack but she misheard me. She heard employment instead of cheese snack. Employment is 'chui jik' as Korean. After all she is still lovely younger sister who can never hate.
