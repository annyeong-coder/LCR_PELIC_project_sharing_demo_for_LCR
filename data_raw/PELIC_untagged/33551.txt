It's better to eat bread in peace than cake in fear After I studied in the University of Pittsburgh I supersized. Every day all teachers gave us a lot of homework's. I usually sleep after I came home and woke up midnight to finished my home works and studied. One day 3 teacher told us ' tomorrow we have quiz also all teachers give us home works except the lovely grammar teacher . I slept as usual but I was so tiered I didn't heard the alarm so I slept till next day . OMG it is 7 30 AM. I studied fast and did my homework's but not perfect . What a horrible day After that date I decided I will not sleep till I do my homework's and study . This is the best way.
