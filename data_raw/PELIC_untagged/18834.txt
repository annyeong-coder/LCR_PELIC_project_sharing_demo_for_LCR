After I finish this semester I will go to travel with my friend. Firstly we will go to San Francisco and stay there for 12 days. We booked the hostel so I hope that we can find some new friends there. After that we will go to Orlando. We will spend 4day on Disney world and 1day on beach. In Augusta 22 we will arrive State College and take school van back to Juniata college.
