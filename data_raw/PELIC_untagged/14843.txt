Although there are many restaurants in Oakland my favorite place to have luch is only one Sweet Basil. The thai restaurants located in squirrel hill has various authentic menues. Everytime I went there I usually ordered Lemongrass soup my favorite one menu. Even if the soup was so spicy with chilli I guarantee that the taste was as same as I used to eat in Thailand! Moreover the service in Sweet Basil is such a very impressing! Last Saturday My friends and I arrived there at 6 p. M. But there were not any available table. While we were deciding whether or not we should leave the hostess came to explain us with so kind manner that she would have available table for us at 6 3O p. M. And If we could wait for a while we could order food with her immediately and she assured that the food would be served as soon as we got table. We all made up my mind to wait. However like she said at 6. 3O we had our table with all food We orderd!Accordingly I usually go to Sweet Basil many times and always suggest anyone who are looking for any excellent restaurant in Oakland to visit there.
