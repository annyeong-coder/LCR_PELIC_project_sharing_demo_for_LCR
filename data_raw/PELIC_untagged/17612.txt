Once I was riding a bus. In that bus there was a man with a wheelchair. As normal people started to get off the bus until we arrived to a station which the man with wheelchair needs. He wanted to get off but the chair of the bus in the other side prevented him from doing that. So he asked for help. Two men tried unsuccessfully to move the chair because they have no idea how this chair can move. Suddenly the man who used the wheelchair stood and moved the chair of the bus. Actually I was surprised I have no idea what kind of disability he has. I don't know why he uses a wheelchair if he can stand on his feet. In fact what that means is that the man can walk just a short distance. I wonder if this event is funny or not. I was surprised by the fact that the man can stand. The question is whether people in that bus were surprised like me or not. Lastly I consider what happened is a memorable event.
