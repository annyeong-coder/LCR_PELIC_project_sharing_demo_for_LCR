There are some steps to plan a party at home. First you should decide the suitable number of the guests and the party's date. Then plan the best party style that everybody can enjoy. Next invite your guests to the home party by mail or telling them directly. Finally prepare the food and make up your room for the party. These steps are easy and clear to plan a party. In fact the most important thing is preparing the food for your party. I think that it is also a little hard job. First you should make a list of the party food. Then buy some cooking stuff that you need such as vegetables rice and other food. Next start on cooking and set up the table before the guests come to your house. At last wait for your guests to come enjoy the time of the party! This is good change to show them your cooking skill.
