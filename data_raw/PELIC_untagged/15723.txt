I enjoy studying grammar in the ELI classroom. I find out that my grammar and speaking now is much better than the first month of coming here. After figuring out the improvement I have more power and passion to study. I try to hand in my homework on time and not miss any classes however I find it's hard to do. Until now I already missed four classes I am so sorry about that. Last week I had a very important exam of my graduate class thus I had to give up the Grammar class at Monday. I feel happy when I study in the ELI class and I enjoy the happy time. Thus I will keep on trying my best in studying. I feel good on ELI teaching method that learning and revising many grammar mistakes from comments when teacher sends back my homework. In addition I want to change my bad habit in grammar classroom that I always speak Chinese with Chinese classmates. I will try to speak English when I get together with them. I will try out speaking English more frequently for improving my English ability because I saw many studies point out practicing is the best way for studying the second language. Thus I hope teacher can give me out more opportunities for practicing. For improving my English I want to carry out any useful methods in enhancing the ability.
