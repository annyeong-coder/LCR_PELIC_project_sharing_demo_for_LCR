In my city Torino the air quality is very bad. The causes of this important problem are several. Torino's inhabitants usually choose to travel by car bacause public transportation is not well organized. The consequence of this is that each family owns two or sometimes three cars ! The traffic in the centre of the city is often chaotic and wait in a traffic jam is a routine. But this happens in almost every medium size italian cities so why the air of Torino is so dirty The geografic position is crucial the city is surrounded by mountains that don't allow the wind to clean the air. As everyone knows air pollution is dangerous for people's health so campains to improve the quality of the air have been started since more than five years ago. For example once a month there is an echological Sunday during which we are not allowed to use our car. Then if the pollution level reachs a given cut off we have restrictions also during the week. Unfortunately this kind of measures is not enough and Torino's air quality is worstening day after day. I think that if we had cheaper and better pubblic transportation and if we used a clean energy source to warm our apartements Torino would be to me the best city to live in . . . But at present day this is only science fiction!!!
