About a month ago my husband and I we were walking in a mall when we suddenly saw a pet store. We got into the store and saw a gorgeous puppy. He liked me too much but I was not sure about getting a pet. We left the store and talk about it. After three days we decided to buy him. Before going to the store I call to make sure that he still there. When we got to the store he was sold. I felt frustrated because I should have bought him when I saw the first time. I felt a little upset with my husband because he ought to have convinced me at that time I should not have thought too much about it. The person who I talked to by phone told me that I could have given my credit card number just to set aside him. My husband saw my sadness and he decided not to go to the house without a puppy. Now I can say that we bought the cutest puppy in the world. All my regrets about the other puppy have gone.
