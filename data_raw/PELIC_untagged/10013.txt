I went to Panama Beach last Spring break I stayed in the beach for some days. I went with a few of my friends and also my brother ANON_NAME_0. I made a mistake when I took with me enough amount of cigarettes because I thought it is cheaper in Pittsburgh but it wasn't. I bought a few cartons of cigarette from the beach it was too cheap. I had a lot of fun there even when I didn't sleep more than a few hours in the whole trip. I did a lot of things I drove a motorcycle for a few days I went to some nightclubs I drank a lot of beer. I joy myself in this trip.
