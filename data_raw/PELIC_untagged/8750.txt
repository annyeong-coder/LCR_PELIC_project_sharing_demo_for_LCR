In my opinion a friend is someone who lets you feel relaxed. When you feel sad he or she can stand in your side and give you encourage. Besides a friend is someone who can shares some secrets with you unlike an acquaintance who doesn't know you deeply. For example I have a good friend who is living in Taiwan now. She is someone who always goes shopping with me and we always chat together. When I have some problems she is always the first person who gives me a hand. In my mind she is the person whom I trust because she can keep my secrets without saying to other people. Although I am in the United States now but she is someone who keeps in touch with me.
