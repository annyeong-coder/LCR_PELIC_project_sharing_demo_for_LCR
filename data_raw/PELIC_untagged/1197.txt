Three years ago I went with my parents on my birthday to a Thai restaurant. At that time I did not know how the Thai food tastes. They were very excited about going to that new restaurant. I had ordered rice with a piece of chicken and a soda. It was the only dish that I can eat. When the waiter bought my dish I tried eating it but it was very sweet and I hate that kind of food. I was forced to eat it because I did not want my parents feel sad that I did not like it. We had a great time together with the nice atmosphere in Blue Elephant restaurant but I will not go back there again.
