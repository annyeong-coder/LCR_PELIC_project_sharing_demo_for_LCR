Here basically I'm telling about three capsules. Firstly the competition in each and every aspect. Now a days there is huge competition for every role if a person not performing up to his given goals other may reach and he may loose his position. Secondly money there is a saying MONEY MAKES MANY THINGS . According to this saying we can understand the importance of the money. So what I want to tell is that don't waste money and work hard for money. Finally personality. Here personality is of two types as inner and outer. Mostly what I want to say is the inner personality is greater than the outer. So try to maintain the inner personality as good as you can because everyone like's you by only the inner feelings of you.
