The most useful things I have learned in Writing 3 this semester is how to make sentences. At first I was not sure a definition of good sentence. I was not also good at making a long sentence which was used transion siganl or subordinary conjunction. But I gradually get used to make sentences well. Making sentences is useful because of knowing how to constract sentence in English. Our Japanese language is often not speak subject so we must suspect who are subject. We also do not use verb after subject. It is not same component between Japanese and English. By making many sentences in English I understand your structure.
