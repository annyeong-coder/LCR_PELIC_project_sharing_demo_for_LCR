Better lithium ion battery aims to re energize electric car scientific american There is a new innovation technology called lithium ion battery that is cheap and can enduring to turn electric car. It contains cell of 20 power and can work in temperature conditions like low as 30c and high as 60c. This battery is economical because it is not based on a very expensive new chemistry . Scientists are impressed because the company discovered this battery that contains chemical components but if the company improve properties. The scientists should be improved the electrons and ions shuffle through the battery system as Jeffrey said. Jeffrey states that the three places must be evolved which they are electrolyte interface between the electrolyte and electrodes. Mechanical engineer yann guezennec points that the positive property for this battery is charge discharge lives at least twice as long as a competitor. In addition to the iron phosphate technology is safety and constant not like other lithium ion technology. Finally this technology has long life and large capacity moreover can be air cooled rather than liquid cooled so it saves both cost and weight. The company plans to begin selling the cells in 2013 .
