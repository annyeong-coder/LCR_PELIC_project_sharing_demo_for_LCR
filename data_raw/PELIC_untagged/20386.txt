In last Summer I went to Egypt with my family. I was going to theire to take a training in Project Manager. I was taking alot of clothes and I was taking enough medicine to my doughter. I was taking some mask to protection my family. I saw many poor people. I saw a little equipment in my trainig. I saw several places like Alahramt and Alhousain. In conclusion I taked alot of advantages from my trip.
