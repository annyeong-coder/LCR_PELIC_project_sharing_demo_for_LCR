My fiance' and I are planning to go to New Yourk next month. We know that it is a very expencive trip althougth we have a friend that live in Manhattan and we are going to stay with her. We are thinking about the best way to have enought money for the trip. First we have to reduce the shopping! We use to buy something new every week because here most of the goods are less expencive than in our country. Second we should eat more times at home insted of trying each time new restaurants! I hope that it will be sufficient to save a little money for our trip.
