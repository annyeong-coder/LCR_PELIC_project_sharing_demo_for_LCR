Som Hi how are you I'm a new student. Could I ask you a few questions ANON_NAME_0 Sure. Som How can I get a student's ID card of the Pitt ANON_NAME_0 First you must pay your tuition for a term and then you can get a report. Next you should be able to bring the report and your documents such as passport driver's license. Finally you will need to take an ID card when you go to Students' center of Pitt. Som How much should I pay for the ID card ANON_NAME_0 Sorry I can't remember exactly that number may be 10 or 20 However I don't forget second card has to pay 20. Som Why can you remember it clearly ANON_NAME_0 Because I lost my first ID card before Spring break so I must buy a new one that ought to spend 20. If you get one you had better take the one carefully. You might go to the center at 9. 00 Tomorrow. Som What benefits can it have ANON_NAME_0 Oh! This is good question. It might have a lot of benefits. For example if you borrow books in a library of the Pitt you have got to use it or you must show your ID to the driver when you ride a bus in Pittsburgh. I think the ID must be important for everyone. Som Thank you for talking.
