I don't agree that good luck has nothing to do with success. For being successful we need to work hard and have a good relationship with boss or someone who could influence you. However All these elements always come with the success without good luck. For example you might be a really good hard worker. Your colleagues might think of you as a good person but you always could make some mistakes in front of your boss. For this reason he might not have a luck so you might not promoted. In conclusion good luck is highly related to the success. I need to pray God for helping me to have a good luck not to lose it.
