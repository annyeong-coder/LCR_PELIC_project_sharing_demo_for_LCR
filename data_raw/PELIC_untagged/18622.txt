On saturday there was a party in my friend's house but I should haven't went there. Everything was terrible. We tried to make a BBQ but we couldn't light on coal. So my friend asked me to buy new coal. While I was going Giant Eagle They set the fire. I shouln't have gone Giant Eagle or I could have waited until they set the fire. After party my friend suggested me to sleep in her house but I wanted to go home. So I tried to pull out my car in parking lot but I hit other person's car which parked next to me. I should have slept my friend's house or I should have driven carefully. Consequently I should have stayed home that night.
