University of Pittsburgh writing 2 English language institute spring 2007 My Hometown I am from Najran a small city in the south of Saudi Arabia. I am going to talk about architecture sightseeing climate and people. First the architecture in Najran is modern but also has some things from the past. There are many amazing houses and buildings. There are many palaces. There are houses that have tents because the people don't like to forget the past. Second Najran has beautiful sightseeing. For example there are many green farms. There are two big parks. There is a big open museum. It has the second biggest dam in Saudi Arabia. It is really great because it is surrounded by the mountains. Third Najran is surrounded by the mountains so the climate is mild. If you live near mountains the climate is very beautiful even in winter but in winter it is sometimes cold. If you live away from the mountains the climate is calm and little bit windy. However if you live far away you will face a problem with the sandstorms. That doesn't happen all the time just for few days in different months. Fourth you shouldn't be afraid or nervous about interacting with people. If you need any help just ask them. For example if you visited us and your car crashed and you knew someone yours neighbor rent office super market
