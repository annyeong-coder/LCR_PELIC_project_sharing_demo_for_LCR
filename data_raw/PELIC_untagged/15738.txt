When I was young I have liked talking to my grandfather. He was always giving me some advice and he was telling me good stories about his history. He demanded that I come to him every weekend. He insisted that he tell me about a story of his life and I ordered that I go to him twice a week. He was very happy and he proposed that I write his story and he recommend I tell in future his story to my children. I preferred I record his story by his voice instead of writing it. After he passed away I suggested that I give every individual in my family a copy of the recording. Now every body in my family can hear his voice and listen to his advice.
