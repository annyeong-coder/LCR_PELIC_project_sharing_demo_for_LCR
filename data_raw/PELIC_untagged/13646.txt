The time that it finish the class always cheer me up. But usually I do not go back to the home at once. Because I have a lot of homework almost everyday. So I go on stay in the school until I finish the homework somehow. At library I sit down on the desk I start study to figure out for lecture I learned meanwhile I doing homework. Sometimes although I want to leave out some homework I do not give up since I grew up.
