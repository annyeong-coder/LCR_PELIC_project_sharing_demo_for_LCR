Seoul which is the capital city of Korea is the place where I had been lived before I came to Pitt where I live now. It takes 2 hours by car to get the city of where I had grew up. The name of city is Dae ANON_NAME_0 where it is called the city of science by people. Because in Dae ANON_NAME_0 there are a lot of research centers which analyze about the statistics for science and hospitals where the patients participate for an experiment. The atmosphere of Dae ANON_NAME_0 is very enthusiastic of studying. As the result many students go on to the university.
