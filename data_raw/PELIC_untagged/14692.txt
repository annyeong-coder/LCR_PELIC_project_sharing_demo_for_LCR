Economists have been puzzled by the question of how a country develops its wealth. Poor and developing countries often depend on exporting a single product however developed countries have a wide range of industries under their export portfolios. The process of diversifying exporting economy is particularly of interest. To investigate this question Hausmann and his colleagues utilized a mathematical network theory to analyze global exporting data collected from 775 types of products. The results having yielded a complex network called product space are represented in a network formed by nodes. The distances between nodes represent the probability of success of the exporting industries in a country. The resulting network forms several clusters upscale products are located in a densely connected core while less sophisticated products occupy a less connected periphery. It was not surprising that wealthy nations take up a whole lot of product space in contrast poor nations mostly focus on peripheral clusters. The authors further explored the network transition of developing country to industrialized country and argued that by following the link between product nodes. There could be a route for developing countries to develop wealth by moving from peripheral to center. The results have been viewed as an influential economic theory that assistant some countries reform related policies.
