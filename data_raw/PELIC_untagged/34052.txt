I think different effective way for different products. We can't use the same method to promote any product. For example if I would like to introduce the perfume I prefer to invite a famous model to wear this perfume and tell consumer the benefits regard this perfume in addition a famous model to introduce this perfume is a good way comes to mind easily after consumers watched advertising. A beautiful model can be a good effective way but I can't use the same way to invite a model to introduce a race car. If I would like to introduce motorcycles or cars the most effective way is To tell consumers the exactly and real experiences for example I saw a Mercedes Benz promoted a new race car and Mercedes invited Schumacher to be a spokesman for Mercedes Benz AMG advertising. I saw Schumacher rode this car fast at advertising began and he told consumers many benefits about this car. Likewise HONDA also invited Rossi who was a motor GP world champion to introduce HONDA Motorcycle CBR. Rossi inspired his experiences to tell consumers benefits about CBR. I think to invite famous people to use the products and inspire their experience to be strength reasons to market a product is the most effective way.
