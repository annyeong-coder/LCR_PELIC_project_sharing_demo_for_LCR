Two weeks ago my friend who lives in Korea called me at 3a. M. I woke up because of noisy bell and picked up my cellphone. She had had a problem with her boyfriend so she wanted to talk it over with me. I wanted to hang up the phone and go back my bed because I was really tired. However I didn't want to bring her down. Therefore I listened her attentively. She thought about breaking up with her boyfriend. I talked her into thinking it over carefully. At that time my little sister who was sleeping next to me woke up. She couldn't sleep because of me. So I couldn't keep on anymore. I told her to call her back in the moring.
