I would like to experiment having synesthesia in all the combinations possible. Is incredible and hard to believe how this flows so naturally. But I would not want to have a permanent synesthesia. Sometimes I suffer of constant headache and I think that this condition could worsen it. One of the aspects that scared me is that I think that synesthesia generates a constant conflict in the parts of the brain that divides the sensations.
