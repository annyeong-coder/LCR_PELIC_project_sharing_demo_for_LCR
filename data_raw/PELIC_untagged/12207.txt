Actually I have two things in my mind. The First thing is to go to Paris for trip and another thing is to go to L. A to attend Pilates workshop. If I can afford to go Paris and to attend Pilates workshop I'll do both. I still go back and forth between Paris and L. A. But I am sure that I am going to attend ELI program in university of Pittsburgh. And I am going to study hard more. I hope so. . . . And I have a important plan that is to reduce my fat. I gained 10 pounds since I came to America. So I am going to not only do exercise but also eat healthful food. And I'll get bicycle. I heard about beautiful autumn weather of Pittsburgh. So I'll enjoy the autumn weather riding bicycle. I am looking forward to riding bicycle along the river.
