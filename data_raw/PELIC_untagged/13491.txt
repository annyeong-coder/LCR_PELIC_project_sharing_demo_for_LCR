I have many friends but the best friend who I like is ANON_NAME_0. He is the best one because he is the friend whom I rely on during the bad time. ANON_NAME_0 and I live in the same city where we grew up. ANON_NAME_0 who working as a teacher is the first friend who I know. We attended the same college which is located in our city and graduated at the same year. After graduation we worked for the same company that specialized on building constructional. ANON_NAME_0 whome I trust him I take his opinion in many personal issues. At the same time he takes my opinion in many issues that considered important for him. I believe that the friend who supports you when you need help is the best friend.
