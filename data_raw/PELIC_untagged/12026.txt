My favorite movie is 'Armageddon' which I watched more than 5 times. Armageddon featuring Bruce Willis is a story about saving the Earth. One day in America a big rock fell from the sky. This rock was only a piece from a giant size rock which was coming toward the Earth. Therefore NASA which is a company of scientists who researches the universe came up with a plan to make a hole at the rock and use nuclear bomb to change the track of the rock. Bruce Willis who works in an oil company was brought to be the captain of a digging team. Two teams are lined up and they went to the space. Unfortunately only one space ship that Bruce Willis was taking arrived there safely. It was not easy to dig a hole. Thus they faced into a problem that their tools were broken. At that moment another space ship crew arrived to support them. Finally they finished digging a hole but remote control of nuclear bomb was broken. The crews had a vote to pick up one person to press the button which will make explosion. Unluckily his daughter's lover was selected. Consequently Bruce Willis decided to stay to activate the bomb. The one hero who loved his daughter saved the Earth.
