The friendship with My best friend Mavis is very important to me in my life. I met her when I was studying university. She is a bright and considerable girl. In this period we had studied and discussed homework together. When I broke up with my boy friend she was talking to me on MSN many times to comfort me and help me go through the tough time. I have appreciated her help and still contacted her when I am studying in PITT.
