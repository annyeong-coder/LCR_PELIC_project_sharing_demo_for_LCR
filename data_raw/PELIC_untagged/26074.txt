I don't believe in superstitions. Superstitious people believe in different signs you'll have a bad day if a black cat crossed your way don't look at the mirror at night don't turn back even if you have forgotten something at home and so on. What is funny is that I never believed in superstitions until I actually experienced one. One day I was going to Baku which is the capital of my country to visit my sister. I woke up early had some breakfast packed my bag and left the house. Hardly had I left the house when I realized that I left my sunglasses at home. The fact that I wasn't superstitious was obvious because I went back home and took my sunglasses. I was waiting at the bus station when my sister called saying that she wouldn't be home. The other thing she said was Make sure you have the keys . I think what happened next is predictable I realized that had forgotten my keys at home. But even after that I was denying that the reason of my bad lack could be returning home. I was really reluctant to go back home again but I did since I didn't have any other choice. My bad luck didn't stop on that. I was walking to my sister's apartment when all of the sudden my shoe broke. Superstitions don't exists and I don't believe in them however I try not to come back home even if I forget something there. . . Just in case. Forget something there. . . Just in case.
