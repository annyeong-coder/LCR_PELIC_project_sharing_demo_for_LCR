My favorite musicians Laura Pausini and Camela are both good singers but they have different styles. Laura Pausini sing more slowly than Camela but Camela is just as well as Laura Pausini. Laura Pausini sings more seriously than Camela but the fans said both musicians singing better and better. Camela sing more powerfully tan Laura Pausini but Laura Pausini is as successfully as Camela. Laura Pausini the harder she sings the more she has fans but Camela sings more effectively than Laura Pausini. Laura Pausini sings well so do Camela. Camela doesn't disappoint her fans and Laura Pausini doesn't either. Both musicians have similarly voice and both are women with a beautiful talent to sing. Laura Pausini isn't unhappy and neither is Camela but women they are very happy with their life.
