They see the online shopping do pollution but I am disagree with the author. I had heard that it is more energy efficient to do online shopping even home delivery of groceries. Having products delivered to your home would have a smaller carbon footprint since. There is a single truck bringing goods to several people's homes as opposed to those individual people all getting in their cars and getting their items separately. I think similar to public transportation. When you have a communal way of transporting multiple things or people it's better than each thing or person travelling separately.
