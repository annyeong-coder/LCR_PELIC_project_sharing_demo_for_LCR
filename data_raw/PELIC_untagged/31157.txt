The ethics of clone is an extremely controversial problem. There are two kinds of clone one is reproductive clone another is therapeutic clone. In my opinion the reproductive clone causes too many ethics chaos it must be banned. However the therapeutic clone is a very useful technology it can bring huge benefit to mankind. People use this technology to product organs and tissues that can save lots of patients' lives scientists use these products to research.
