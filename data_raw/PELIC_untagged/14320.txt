I like Japanese ramen. We can find ramen in the United States too. However it's totally different from that one in Japan. It's kind of noodles in soup. It is served by a big bowl. There are 4 main types of ramen soup miso shyoyu sio and tonkotsu. The soup is usually salty and has aroma. Also we enjoy topping. Individual ramen shops have their own particular flavor and style. I miss tonkotsu ramen now. Tonkotsu soup is made from pork bone. The color of soup is cream. The taste is salty thick and mild. It smells unique and strong. You will be surprised if you try at first. However I recommend you to try if you have a chance to visit Japan.
