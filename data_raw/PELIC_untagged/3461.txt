The exterior color is gray and the interior color is black. After that BMW M5 has 4 doors and the cost is 82 900. Second there is BMW 645. The modern is 2004. BMW 645 took about 25 080 mileages. The body style is convertible. The exterior color is silver black. After that BMW 645 has 2 doors. The cost is 62 988. If you can give me your opinion for those cars I will be happy. Love
