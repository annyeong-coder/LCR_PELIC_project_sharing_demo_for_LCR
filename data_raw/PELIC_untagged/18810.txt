I learned many things in this semester and the most important thing I learned was grammar. From my perspective grammar is the principle part in English. So have good grammar skill is very important. Before I took these courses my grammar part was very weak so I tried to improve my grammar in this semester. After I took these courses I felt that my English improved a lot. I learned many new vocabularies and how to use correct grammar. Now I can find some mistakes from the essay and I know how to correct them. But before I took these courses I couldn't find mistakes and corrected them. I felt that my grammar was improved and it was the most important thing I learned in this semester.
