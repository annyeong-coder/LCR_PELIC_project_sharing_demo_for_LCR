My last weekend was boring to practice English. I do not know why I attempt to find it out so I got a few reasons that make me lacy to finish homework on the weekend. First it might be I often spend a lot of times on the internet around fifty percent of day time because there are many interesting websites that attract every people who are love to surf the net aren't you Second I usually feel so sleepy when I stay in my room. It is probably light since our room's color concept is white and clear actually it shout make me fresh and bright but our landlord he provide not enough light in a room so every room are dark and depress. Finally I love to use the rest of time on the day to cook and create a new food for dinner. I like eating and learning how to cook. It will be challenging if we can combine the rest things the kitchen to make good food. Right There are the reasons the make me lacy to learning English on weekend
