It is a nice thing to make your bed tidy when you wake up in the morning. It makes you feel that everything is neat. It is easy to make your bed if you follow the right steps. First cover the bed with a fitted sheet. Second put a bed sheet above the fitted sheet. Then wrap the pillows and put them on the upper of the bed. Finally spread the comforter over the bed sheet. I like to make my bed every day. It makes me relax and gives me a good feeling every morning. For that reason my youngest sister starts to make her bed when she knows about my morning mood secret.
