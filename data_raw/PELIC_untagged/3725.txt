It is really great dilemma. Poor Betty. . But she SHOULD HAVE TRIED to know David before she has got deep relationship. She SHOULDN'T HAVE TOLD him that she loved. She SHOULD decide if she wants to marry with David or not without thingking the James. She should tell ANON_NAME_0 about her feelings. They should decide what they will do. Than Betty may date with James and try to know him better.
