Dear ANON_NAME_0 How are you I am so glad that our classes are almost finished so we can have a break. What would you like to do in your summer I am planning to do these two things. The most important thing is that I will perform model patients of different kind to help my husband practice his clinical test. It might be my daily life in this August it may also be boring or may improve my English too. However the things in our family are responsibilities of both of us so we should hand it together. Another thing I want to do is fishing at Marine State Park or North Park on weekends. So I can enjoy the sun grass trees birds and water. Meanwhile fishing helps me develop a patience that is I need. And if lucky I can have fish to eat. Live fish is my favorite. It is one stone kills two birds . Hope us have a healthy and easy summer. Take care. Best regards Fen
