The most important advantage of man's thinking ability is that as soon as we have learned new things we have modified quickly them. Computer technology is an excellent example. We must use items of this technology. Cation items. For example a student from China or Japan has filled on an application form and sent a few minutes to a university in the US. Since then his application has been assessed and answered a couple days. Before the internet this process takes two or three months. In words of Americans time is money. Although we pay to use the internet it gives us time. The more information is the more power in the today world. We usually have to learn a lot of information a few minutes. Computers has stored many information its memory. Moreover we buy a cd and we use it in the computer. Todays many teachers make their students prepare their homework on the computer. This method is benefit for teachers. So they don't waste time to understand student writings. Writings in the computer are easily read by anybody. Many information has been quickly transferred the entire world by the computers. If we look a problem any part of the world we will send an e mail that has our emotion. On the other words anybody demonstrates his emotion when he wants. Because we live in the century of speed we have to transfer our information to the other quickly. For example if you have invested your money in the stock market you must follow it and you must answer when will sell your stock. Otherwise you would a lot of money for your slow transferring information. To sum up computer technology has still changed our life style three part one is to speed telecommunication second is to search and to reach any benefit knowledge and finally is to carry our comments to anybody.
