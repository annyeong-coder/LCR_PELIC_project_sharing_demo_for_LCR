Case 2 I think ANON_NAME_0 should have kept copies of his documents and files. Also his supervisor should have understood ANON_NAME_0 who put himself at risk situation for the work. So his supervisor shouldn't have fired him. On the other hand ANON_NAME_0 shouldn't have entered the building which was unsafe after the fire. That put his life in dinger and he should have thought about his family more than his clients. Finally I think the board of his company should change or at least replace the supervisor because he couldn't manage and avoid the risk that effects on the documents and the company's information.
