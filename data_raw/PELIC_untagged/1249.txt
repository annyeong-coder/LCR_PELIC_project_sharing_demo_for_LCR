There could have been a big seafood festival in anther town near Marksville. That might have needed lots of fish. So the city around the coast might have been supposed to send many of the fish by helicopter. The helicopter might have used nets in carrying fish to the festival. On the way to the place where the festival held the nets might have been cut all of a sudden. Finally the fish might have fallen down to Marksville.
