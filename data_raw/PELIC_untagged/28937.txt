My topic is about sports providing entertainment and considered valuable. When I was a little kid I was an enthusiastic fan about soccer. There were two teams which are well known in my country. They also had a competitive match. Soccer is valuable in the Arabic gulf and particularly in Saudi Arabia. Since these two teams have more and more rewards and won many times their fans increasingly grow and have fun in watching their competitions. After many teams have emerged and became more competitive the league becomes more strong and interesting. So beeing unable to watch two matches simultaneously the sport organization formed a program that broadcasts these activities in the same day.
