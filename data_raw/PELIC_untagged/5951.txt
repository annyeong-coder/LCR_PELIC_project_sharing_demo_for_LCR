In my opinion the greatest problem C in Romania is the transition period C from communism to democracy. It is a period of time C of many changes C most of the misunderstood. Also it is a time with many new rules and laws some of them hard to apply. Each law that has to be changed is another big problem. The entire process is long and painful. The other countries from the European Union give us advice NC and suggestions that are good to give but once again too hard to apply. Legislation NC in Romania it isn't a definite thing right now but I hope it will be in the near future.
