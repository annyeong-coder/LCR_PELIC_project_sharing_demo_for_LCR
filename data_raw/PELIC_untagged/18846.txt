After this summer semester I am going to prepare my TOEFL exam. Actually I am going to apply to Pitt's graduate school getting a M. A degree on December. I have to study hard until get an admission from the department of Linguistics. My major is Korean Linguistics so I would like to learn about general linguistics in the U. S. And then I am going to continue studying English next semester as a part time student. I will just take two classes grammar and writing because it is useful to apply to graduate school. I hope to enter the Pitt's graduate school but my English is still not good at admitting from the department of linguistics in Pitt. If I won't acceptable I'm going to apply to another school. I'm looking for another school in Pittsburgh. I don't want to move other cities because I have already adjusted to here well. On the other hand I'm going to get married with my boyfriend on December 26th at Korea. My boyfriend is working at Institute of Korea University. He is a PhD candidate so he works hard everyday. After wedding we will come back here together January 2010. My boyfriend will learn English first and then he will look for his post doctor program in the States. I think it probably takes long time but we never give up. He is just trying to look for a job and I am also going to apply to graduate school in the states. English skill is very important benefit to be a professor. He and I would like to be a lecturer or professor in University. I believe that nothing can be obtained without any effort. For our goal we have to work hard. Even we have little money it would be happy. I really hope to enjoy my life in Pittsburgh for a while. When I came here last winter I hate Pittsburgh but now I love here. My mind totally changed because of ELI and my friends. I appreciate everything. I'll do best even thought this semester finished.
