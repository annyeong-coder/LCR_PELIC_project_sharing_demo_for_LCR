I got my medical degree on 2006. Before I got the degree I had been interesting to achieve my dream being a Doctor but at the same time I had been warring about the hard work that I have to do and the long road of medicine to achieve my target. As soon as the school started I started focusing and working hard on my study. After that I had realized how much I enjoyed studying medicine and being a Doctor.
