Friends are as the sun that lights the life of their friends. They support and encourage you also they cheer you up . My friends can be classified based on a place where I got know them so I can classify my friends to three types school's friends university's friends and job's friends. School's friends are the first type of my friends. They were the first friends who I met. We had a lot of memories. For example in 2005 we dropped one of my friends in the swimming pool and he followed each one of us and dropped us in the pool. They are the closest friends because I have been known them since 1997. Each one has a different major so we can get different information from each other. For example I studied computer and one of them studied dentist so I have some information about dentist. The second group of my friends is the university's friends. They are classmates . For examples we did some projects together and spent time working on them. In addition we can discuss about technology Issues because we have the same background such as security problem for wireless network. Also they come from different areas . For example there are three from the central region the fourth is from the western region the fifth and the sixth are from the southern region. The third category of my friends is job's friends. I stayed with them 8 hours daily. They are the funniest group and the time run fast. They have different types of education such as diploma bachelor and master degrees In summary living without friends is as Living in the dark. I classified my friends to three groups based on the place that I met them. There are three kinds of my friend job's friend school's friend and job's friend.
