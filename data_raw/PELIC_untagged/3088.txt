Gambling is a game that you throw money to bet your cards or something it can let you have fun and get money but also can kill your life and your family. We must control ourselves when we play this. Actually I play poker with my friends almost every week. One thing is good that we all know how to control ourselves. For example we didn't spend a lot of money when we play poker. Each time we play just spend 20 30 bucks and we never borrow money to play it. One of my friends told me We just play for fun and we are all good friends so win lot money from friends makes me feel bad. Some of my friends in Taiwan don't know how to control themselves. For example they borrow a lot of money from bank or other friends when they lost a lot and they keep play. After that they can't give it back so they have to borrow some money from others. The situation keeps like this so when they can't give the money back they have to hide themselves. Now still have many people kill themselves when they can't give the money back. They finished their life that no one can take care of the family. The problem became more and more. Gambling is very excited but the point is that we have to control ourselves.
