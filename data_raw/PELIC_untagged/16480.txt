I think since the population that use other languages than english increases english won't be the most widely used language people may still know english but they won't become ones that only know english. Based on Nye's experience it was english that gave her and the old woman the chance to know each other. It was english that made the women at the gate became friends. Most of them did not speak english as the first language but it is the same language that they all can speak.
