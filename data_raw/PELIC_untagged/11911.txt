Global Warming It is an increase in the average temperature of the earth as a result of the GREEN HOUSE EFFECT. The energy that warms the earth comes from the sun in the form of radiation which are absorbed by the sureface of the earth which in turn release or reflect some of these radiation toward the atomspheric space . Part of these radiation remains trapped in the earth's atomspher due to the presence of certain gases which mainly are CO2 and methane. These gases act somewhat like the glass in a green house and are thus known as green house gases. There are many sources of CO2 eg fossil fuel consumption which used in all ways of transportation. Or it is a result of decreased its removal eg deforestration as we know the trees use CO2 and release O2. What can be done The is a very simple theoriticlly but practically it is a very difficult. Our target can be achieved by elimination of extra CO2 production and implementing strict programs by the international community. One of the things is looking for alternative energy source eg using solar power wind power water flow and Nuclear Power! Preserve and plant more trees. Use of hybrid electric vehicles. We shouldn't forget to ask our selves what we have done on personl level to make our world better not just for us but also for our future generations. I can conclude the whole issue in one word mentioned in the title GLOBAL
