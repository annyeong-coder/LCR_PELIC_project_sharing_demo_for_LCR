Dear Student I am ANON_NAME_0 who is a student in the ELI. I want to congratulate you come to the ELI. The ELI which is the best place to learn English gives you two option to be a student part time education and full time education. If you don t have enough time or if you work somewhere you can choose part time education if you have enough time you can choose full time education. In my opinion if you want to learn English in a short period of time you should choose full time because there are five different types of classes at full time education writing reading grammar speaking and listening. Learning English is required so much effort as you know. If you want to learn English in a short time you should study hard and follow your lessons regularly. You have to study hard this is fact but at the same time you should have fun with your classmates or your teachers. There are many activities in the ELI such as going shopping visiting museum. As far as I am concerned you should try to involve all ELI s activities. Also the ELI find a conversation partner who is a native speaker to improve your speaking skill. This activity is perfect you d better participate it. Don t worry you are the right place but don t forget when you learn English you must be patient because learning English takes time. Sincerly ANON_NAME_0
