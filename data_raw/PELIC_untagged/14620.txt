I think there will be several things in the near future. I'm going to go to ELI in the next term. But I may not attend the first class because I might go on a trip from end of this year. I might go to Vancouver to ski. Olympic Winter Games will be held at Vancouver in 2010 so I might feel like Olympic athlete at the ski area. However this trip might be last trip in the life of the U. S. I'll finish ELI courses in April and one month later I have to go back Japan. I might look for a part time job or I could get pregnant when I go back Japan. Either way unfortunately I might not use English.
