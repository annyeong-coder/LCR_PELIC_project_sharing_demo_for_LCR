Losing accent can be explained in more than one way. The first one is about the language. Once you first move to another country where people do not speak the same language as you are you start trying to imitate them and you might start losing the accent that you have. The second one is to lose the way of living that you are used to. For example and in my case I changed many things that are related to the way that I am used to live with.
