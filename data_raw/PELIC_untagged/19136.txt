When I was 10 years old I was playing in Rivadavia square when I saw an accident. A man was driving a car when the bus that was forward stopped without warning. After that my mom called the ambulance so we waited there. While the ambulance was coming a doctor that was walking in the square run quickly and took care the passengers. Fortunately nobody died but someone were injured.
