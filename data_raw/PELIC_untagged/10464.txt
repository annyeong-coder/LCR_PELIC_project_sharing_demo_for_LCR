Tevhide Last Name 02 25 2008 WRITING 3 F My Weekend I didn't forget this weekend which was magnificent. We went to Seven Spring with our friends. We got up at 9. 30 And we had breakfast next we left at home to meet with our friends at 11. 00. After meeting friends we drove our car to go to Seven Spring. We were at Seven Spring at 13. 00 . Firstly we learned knowledge about Seven Spring activity. We decided to do sledding with sled. Our decision was truth because we spent excellent time with our friends. We sledded many times . When the weather was dark we must return at home. Finally we were at home at 9. 00. We was very tired but the same time we were happy. For these reasons I suggested you that if you have time you should go to Seven Spring to sled. I want to go there again if I have time.
