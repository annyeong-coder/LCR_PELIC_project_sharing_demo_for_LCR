I don't think the Internet is a good place to meet a romantic partner. First I think the Internet is not a real world so everyone might not be honest. Second I don't think you can do any romantic things on the Internet by using e mail or massage without knowing their face. Finally I think Internet is a good place to communicate with other people but if you want to be close to another person you have to date with him or her in the real world. The Internet can start the relationship between you and another people. If you want to meet a romantic partner I think you should know how the guy is then you can decide whether he or she is really a romantic partner.
