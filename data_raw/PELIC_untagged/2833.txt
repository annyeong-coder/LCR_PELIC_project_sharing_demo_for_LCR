When I came back home from a hard day my husband told me cheer up! . While I was cooking dinner my husband was watching TV. After dinner my husband helped me out washing dishes. When I was difficult in English he figured it out. If I failed my English test he looked into the test paper. When I sit down on the desk flowers always cheered me up. Before I looked up my English book I turned off radio and TV. When I opened the book I went over my book. Sometimes he brought me a cup of coffee and some candies. Although English is difficult for me but I'm happy.
