In Korea we prepare a lot of the dishes in New Year's Day. For example we eat Galbi which is made from beef short ribs in New Year's Day. We also eat rice dumpling soup. When we cook rice dumpling soup we put rice cake in the soup. The soup symbolizes cleanliness. After eating the soup we think that we add a year of our age. Also we have a custom. We perform a New Year's bow to older people. If we bow the people we would be able to get money. That is why we hope that we have many cousins.
