The prominent person in recent 100 years in Taiwan is the second president ANON_NAME_0 Jing ANON_NAME_1 who has been said to contribute to the economy and infrastructures most. Around fifty years ago Taiwanese people were poor and the main industry was agribusiness so he thought that in order to facilitate to develop the economy and make people have better life Taiwan needed a lot of basic structures such as transportation systems. Therefore in his early presidency he undertook a number of huge constructive plans. These structures have been thought to be stiff achievements even until now. They really helped people develop international trades that made people keep away from poverty. It is believed that if there were not these infrastructures nowadays Taiwan could not become a developed country. In addition for the political system Taiwan was governed by a single party Kuomintang KMT which came to Taiwan from mainland China. The governmental officials were composed of the people who belonged to KMT except former migrants. This government was said to be a regime at that time. Most people disliked KMT's members. There was a tragedy happened in the first president's time a lot of protesters was killed for they denounced KMT. ANON_NAME_0 Jing ANON_NAME_1 decided to change people's thought that the people who were related to KMT had many advantages. He started to amend policies and encouraged the public to work for the government especially the former migrants. Thus he destroyed the privileges which the late coming people have and made everyone have the same right. Furthermore in his late presidency he also made some significant changes that he liberated people from many prohibitions. After that people could fund private media press build political parties and make protests. Taiwan was considered to be really a liberal country. ANON_NAME_0 Jing ANON_NAME_1 is said to be a typical presidential exemplar.
