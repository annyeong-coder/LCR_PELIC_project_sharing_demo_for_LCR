I had very annoying experience on the phone last weekend. At first I got phone call from a telemarketer. He started to persuade me to pick up a product which was interesting for me but then suddenly he asked me to hold on. After a few minutes he promised to call me back. One hour later he called again and talked into buying another product which was not interesting for me. The telemarketer wanted me to sign up the sales agreement at the same day. I asked him for one day time because I needed to think it over but he kept on talking about my last chance for a good purchase. I strongly turned down his offer but he didn't give up. Finally I became angry and I hung up.
