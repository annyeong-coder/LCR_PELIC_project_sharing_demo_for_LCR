I agree that children lost the sense of pleasure in thier own learning by the third grade of fourth year. However my reason about the argumment is different from them. First of all children have a kind of attention deficit which means that children seldom keep interested in something for long time. The reason why the children arrive at school with full of energy and curiosity is that they have little experiences and are unaccustomed to everything. Also advanced level is not funny because it usually requires extra efforts and time. The children must practice it again and again in order to learn it. It looks boring and serious so I think the reason of losing sense of pleasure is not only because of strict rules of school.
