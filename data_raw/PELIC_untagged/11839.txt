My house is my favorite place to eat lunch There are many reasons to choose my house as favorite place to eat lunch. First of all I enjoy eating traditional foods such as Basin and Roshda which are almost impossible to find them elsewhere in Pittsburgh. Another reason I like eating in a quiet place because I get upset by many people watching me eating in crowded places as restaurants. In addition our house has a beautiful garden with a lot of smiley flowers that opens to our dining room and makes our lunch more delicious especially during summer. Finally what makes my house is favorite of mine to have lunch at is that I live with two other colleagues who cooperate with me to prepare our favorite lunch with the least price compared to restaurants where we suppose to pay too much money for ordinary food.
