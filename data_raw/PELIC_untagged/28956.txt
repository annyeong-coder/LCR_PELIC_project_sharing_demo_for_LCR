I have worked diligently to prepare myself for the rigorous studies required to earn an advanced graduate degree. I firmly believe that opportunity comes to only those who are prepared. I hope to share my unique experience with other people as I continue learn from other. As a member of your graduate community I hope to be a positive addition to your school. Therefore I request your consideration for admission to the graduate program. I had an admission for the department of Physical Therapy in the school of Rehabilitation at Yonsei University in 2000. During my undergraduate period I studied the fundamental courses and more advanced courses about the Physical Therapy. Among these many courses I was especially enamored in the musculoskeletal treatment. So I took many courses related to that field as many as possible. In my senior year I prepared the theoretical thesis about Back Pain related to disc to get my B. S. In YSU. It was a very good chance to decide to continue my study at graduate school. Also I had worked for physical therapist in a rehabilitation hospital that had a lot of patient especially muscular disorders for 5 years. I believe that a great deal of experience and broad knowledge in the physiotherapy field cultivated in me a wider point of view. I have the flexibility to carry out advanced jobs in remarkably musculoskeletal fields. I know I am competent enough to cope with your toughest requirements and will greatly appreciate your favorable consideration. My role as a human being is to dedicate myself to the field of science. As a responsible member of society I hope to perform my given role to the best of my ability. I am capable of accomplishing great things particularly with expert guidance from you. I also believe that I have the background and skills necessary to tackle your program. I will do so with great enthusiasm.
