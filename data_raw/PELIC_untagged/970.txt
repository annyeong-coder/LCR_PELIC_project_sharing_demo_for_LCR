1. Vest guardian I'll choose ANON_NAME_0 Wang of the vest guardian. Because first she's Caroline's sister also she love children and she would be able to provide a good home for both Meredith and Andrew. Second ANON_NAME_0 and her husband have a job. For example she is an elementary teacher and he is a high school teacher. Third they don't have children. I think will not be good guardian to the Violet and Henry or Lydia and ANON_NAME_1. Because First Violet and Henry are old and they have a disease. Second Lydia is not real family also she is very busy because she is violinist. Third ANON_NAME_1 is a bachelor although he is blood relation.
