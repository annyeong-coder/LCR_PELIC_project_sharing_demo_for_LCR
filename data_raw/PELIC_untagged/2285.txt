I do many things when I study. For example I eat something what water and some cookies ect while I'm studying. I guess bad habits. When I see my surround something while I'm studying I concentrate on it. So I get easily inattentive. And I like bright light when I study. I usually use only the pencil eraser and dictionary. Also I'm a person that can't stay up all night studying. So I do a little bit of it daily. And I like at the library when I study. I would like to get rid of my bad habits of study.
