This is the place where I have lived for 23 years. It is located in Seoul near the YangJae river. This picture which is crowded with a lot of reeds is so beautiful. There are some buildings which are very tall. Those kinds of buildings which is called 'skyscraper' are common in my country. Probably This is the first time when I moved to there. This picture that I show you is filled with brown color. And this photo is my friend's picture whose named is So hyun.
