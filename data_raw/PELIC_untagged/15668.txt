If I was missing something or someone and a person claiming to be psychic offered to help me find that thing or person I would accept his her offer because I can find what I missed before I lose it. Also I'll try my best to find them not just I'll depend on him her. I'll look for what I missed by myself. In addition the police will help me to find it. Otherwise I'll appreciate the psychic helping especially if he she has a good reputation and unique psychic powers. For example if the psychic helped the police to find missing people or things on perfect time and found them in a good condition I will ask the psychic to help me to find what I missed because I'll do any thing to help them I'll pray and ask help from other people who can help me.
