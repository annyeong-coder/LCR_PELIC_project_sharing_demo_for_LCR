Prison break is a series playing a kind of action. Michael Scofield is the brother of Lincoln two whose love each other more than anything else. I saw a lot of this kind of movies a few of which were so grabbing. Lincoln is an innocent guy but some bad people blamed him that he killed the vice president brother. The two good points that Scofield believed that Lincoln is an innocent guy and want to search for the fact. Scofield is the actor playing the most important role. After he realizes that it wasn't his brother who killed the vice president brother he tried his best to reveal the true story. So the second good point its how Scofield helped his brother Lincoln to break out of the jail. The most interesting scene starts from the plane and how he made friends in the jail. He made many friends all of whom are prisoners. This series has two bad points from my points of view the first I think it's impossible that a man in this world has this kind of brain that has many planes. The second point I think it's boring that he broke out from more than one jail. But after al I think it's the best series that I seen. What prove that its interesting series I finished it in one week.
