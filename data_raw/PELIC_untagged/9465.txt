Hello My name is Myungsun Last Name . It means 'Bright Angle' in Korean. I like my name because my grandfather gave me the name. I always try to live like my name. In my free time I usually enjoy watching TV and chatting with my friends. I like playing games too. I don't have a special hobby but I like trying new experiences. My major is Computer Science and I was working at the wine importing company before I come here. But I didn't like it so I decide to give myself a new chance. My plan in this year is preparing TOEFL test and studying Nursing. So I'm studying English at ELI and looking for the information about Nursing Schools. Because I've been wanting to be a nurse since I was young. For now I'm doing my best for my future and I'll do more to accomplish my dream.
