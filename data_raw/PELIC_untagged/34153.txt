Everyone want to play some games. Some people play for build their muscles and others for fun. Any ways they have to enjoy sports ethics. The people have different opinion about playing a game is fun only when they win or it is not only fun when they win. In my opinion playing games is not only fun when I win for several reasons acquiring a lot of things after the win obtaining a good relate after games and getting good reputation. First of all acquiring a lot of things after the win. Usually the athletes gain many skills after the game. For instance he knows different ways to play from his competitor during game. In addition he improve his ability in this games. Second obtaining a good relative after games. After game usually the player shaking hands each other's. So they already make good relative. For example when the player win in some games and he starts shaking hands his competitor and smiles him. The other people like to make friend with him. Some people say that playing a game is fun only when they win. That correct because every people feel that. Although they say when they win every fan interesting with us. In my opinion getting good reputation after games is more important than fun and anything else. For instance If people behave modestly after games or smile when he lose. That create a good reputation for player. To sum up playing games is not only fun when we win. Because there are a lot of advantages beside that. Like acquiring a lot of things after the win obtaining a good relate after games and getting good reputation. So try to feel other advantages after playing games.
