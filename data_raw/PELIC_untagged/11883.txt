Gestures really important to deal with foreign people or to understand each other. I'm foreign student and I can't speak clear but it is not big problem I show them some movement then they understand me its gesture. I don't need to memorize all countries gestures because most of the countries gestures are same like other countries but not all of them. Example I was in Korea most people were bowing each other that was really strange gesture for me. In my country we bow only for god but we never bow for person. I realized gesture not work all the time. Its depend where you are witch country and what kind traditional.
