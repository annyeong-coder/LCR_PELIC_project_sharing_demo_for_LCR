First of all survive in the United of America is not easy affair because you have to get a valid visa that are legal and acceptable if you would like to stay the big thing is money. For example myself I spend a lot of money for study and survive in this country. In addition people are very different method when you were a student in the U. S . Especially students were sponsored by a company or government have to try the best to learn a kind the major their study. The most difficult factor is visa policies also many international students have to do a challenge and imply because all student must to show many resources when you need the government. The last one pressure of being international student is homesick . Thinking about goes away for many years at the begin to feel sad everyday because you miss our cultures parents food etc . .
