Dear new students If you want to improve your writing ability it is the best choice to study in the Writing 4 class. We practiced writing during the class. First the teacher taught us how to write a paragraph. Second after being familiar with the paragraph we started to write an essay. There are many ways to write a good essay. We learned about how to use core vocabularies in your writing how to compare the two different things and describe causes effects. We studied all of these in the class so after finishing this semester we already can write an essay by ourselves. Finally it is important to do the homework. Because you want to write a clear essay all you have to do is following the steps that the teacher makes you do. I think you will lean a lot of things. Just do your best. You will enjoy the class!! Sincerely yours Pei Tzu ANON_NAME_0
