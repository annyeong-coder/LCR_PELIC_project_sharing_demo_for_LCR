Why University of Massachusetts Boston When decided which school I am going to apply University of Massachusetts Boston becomes my top choice. There are several reasons for me to determine that UMass Boston is the school I want to work on my graduate study the most the location the qualities of teachers and the courses. First of all the campus is so nice that I would like to spend my time there. When I first visited there I started loving there. I love oceans a lot and the campus is also near the Boston Harbor so that it is the best choice for me. And the campus is near Downtown Boston hence the transportation and living function are convenient. Furthermore the facilities and activities which are well organized and diverse also appeal to me. Secondly the qualities of teachers attract me as well. As Dr. Williams Koehler mentioned during the information session the teachers in the UMass Boston are not only good at doing research but also knowing how to teach. For many students understanding and comprehending the lectures in class is much more useful than studying by ourselves. Consequently the qualities of teachers are important for me. Finally and also the most important things the courses are related to the fields I would like to concentrate on. After visited Dr. ANON_NAME_0 ANON_NAME_1 and attended the information session I figured out that the MSIT program of UMass Boston really fascinated me and will contribute to my future career. To sum up there are still many reasons for me to decide that the University of Massachusetts Boston is the school which I really want to work on my advanced study. However the three most significant factors are the location the qualities of teachers and the courses.
