Last night I was in friend's house. At 10 00 PM he said that we had to buy something to eat and he went out to the grocery store. I was alone in his home watching TV. Suddenly the phone began to sound I answer the phone and said hello a feminine voice sounded on the other side and she said hello is ANON_NAME_0 there no ANON_NAME_0 is not here. Who are you I'm Camila a friend Ok Camila can you call back him in 20 minutes Yes no problem! Bye I hung the phone up and I thought why ANON_NAME_0 had not told me about that girl maybe she was his girlfriend. I had to find out more about them. I came back to living room and I waited in for him. 5 Minutes after he came back then I said ANON_NAME_0 Camila called 10 minutes ago ok He said nervously I will call her but first we have to eat this delicious pizza After that I decided gave up my investigation into the call because ANON_NAME_0 would never tell nothing about her.
