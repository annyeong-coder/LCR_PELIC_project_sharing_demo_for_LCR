Saving drafts especially first draft on the computer can help your writing a lot. The first time that I understood its importance was when I wrote my seminar. I didn't think to save my draft on the computer. Just when I was close to end my seminar the Word crashed and everything that I wrote disappeared. After that accident I thought I will never forget again to save my draft . When I wrote my thesis I remembered to save my draft but I didn't save the first draft. In the first draft I wrote free writing writing without thinking. It included very good and creative ideas. Since then when I start writing I save every draft. To save draft really helped me in writing my SOP Statement Of Purpose. Because I saved that I always could find good ideas in the draft when I felt that my mind is empty. Based on my experience it's very helpful to save all revisions of my draft document from the first one until the final.
