I totally agree with the one long vacation a year instead of several short vacations. If we have on long vacation we can do something more seriously and deeply. For example imagine the situation when you have 3 months vacation. Yon would like to go to the Africa which is very interested to want to go to in your life sometime or you could try to climb Mt. Everest. These things can not be done in short vacation. In addition if you go somewhere to trip in a short vacation yon will see the very small amount of the place where you go. Besides in one or two weeks for a vacation you must very hurry yourself. If you hurry you will miss what you should do before you leave. Yon can't even stay calm and think about you Practically a short term of break is only for relaxation. Although for a student they need a time to experience or expand knowledge by travel somewhere. We can't spend our precious vacation for a just relax. So one long vacation is more beneficial time to students than several short vacations.
