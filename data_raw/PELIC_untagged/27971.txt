When my brother was young he had to write daily diary. It was homework for young children. One day I saw that my mother was laughing. She told me that she cannot help laughing when she read his diary. That diary was written in poor handwriting and made up of just three sentences. It said that he ate brown seaweed soup how to make the soup and the soup was delicious. We had no idea how he could get the weird recipe of the soup. What's funny about this is how he was young. The fact that he does not want to write diary was obvious. Because it was too short and simple. I don't know whether he remember this story or not. Anyway the fact that my mother and I could laugh together was delightful memory.
