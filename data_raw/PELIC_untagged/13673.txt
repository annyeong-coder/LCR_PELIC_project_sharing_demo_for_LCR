Actually I don't like my room. Because my room is small even it needs to clean. I always mass up my room. So I make up my bed and I have to straighten it up. First I throw away empty bottles and old food. Then I put tea table away. Because when I have a meal I turn it around. Furthermore when I move around this apartment the management didn't paint the wall. I need touch it up. I'll do the things it may be lovely.
