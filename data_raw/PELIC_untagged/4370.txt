When I was at the airport this morning I found myself without my cell phone. I should have checked it before I left my house. I could have asked my wife to tell me about it. I could have put it in my car. My cell phone must be in my house. It can't be in my school because I used it last night at home. But I don't have to go back to home to bring it. I could use the public phone. It might be more expensive. But I could not find any phone booth. There must have been more than one booth. People working at the airport might have moved the phone booths to some where else. They sould have some booths in the airport for the people just like me.
