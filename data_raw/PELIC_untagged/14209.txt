A friend is someone who is different from acquaintance neighbor or college. You can go out or hang out with many people surrounding you but those are not all who you can rely on. You don't talk your problems or concerns you have to peers. Friends are who knows you well as your family. They can share your feelings. They can keep your promise. When you have a problem which is hard to deal with maybe acquaintance might be indifferent. The only person who want to cope with you will be your friend. If your have a friend who really cares you much always be thankful to he or she.
