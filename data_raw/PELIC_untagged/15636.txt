April 21th 1965 is the day that twisted my destiny. In that day the forces of the enemy reached my tiny village troops of soldiers installed their tents all around the village waiting for a signal from their superior to attack. We children and women have been told to stay in a big basement and not to leave it under any circumstances. Yet my friends curious as always wanted to see the enemy's base. An inner voice told me not to follow them in their adventure but I couldn't resist. Now that I narrate my story I'm forty four years old and I'm still a slave in a base somewhere in this gigantic world far from my family and friends. This deleterious day hasn't left my thoughts not even for a second I wish I had followed my intuition and refused to accompany them. If I hadn't acted foolishly and childishly I wouldn't have endured violence and bad treatment all these years. If only I had ran as my friends did when the soldiers noticed our presence instead of freezing in my place without trying to escape. Hours days months and years went by I got used to serve those strangers they still are strangers to me even though I spent more time with them than with my family but I always think of what I would become if I weren't here. My imagination leads me also to wish and hope for unrealizable dreams I wish they would allow me to rest for only one day as in Christmas or in Thanksgiving. I wish someday I would see my parents or even here of them. And I finally hope their law changes and the colonel of this base get a permission to release me before I die.
