Pressures essay. I'm going to talk about my pressures of being an international student. My three biggest pressures of being an international student is Time Money and my Language. 1 The reason why time is one of my issues is because I'm working as an aupair during the time when I'm not in school. So I don't have any freetime at all those days when when I have a lot of home work which it's almost every day. So I'm often very tired in school just because of the reason that I don't get enough sleep. 2 Of course that my budget influenses. A lot of my money goes to food gas and parking that is an expendiure that I didn't had before not in the same extension at least. And I don't think I have to name that you don't become a millionaire of working as an aupair so smal thinks like that it's alot for me when it comes to it's end. Furthermore I don't like the feeling that always have to think of what I can afford or not. And now I meen just daily items like schampo and toothpaste. But I have to do it now because yet again I've so many other spendings that I didn't had before. 3 I'm not really use to be corrected by a seven year old. So when I first came to the US was that a very strange feeling for me. And that you always have to plan what to say before you say it It's very arduous. You can not really be the truly you when you have a language handicap. To always now that the people in your surrounding notise your accent and that you want to say something but you avoiding to do it because you don't know how to do say it correctly it is very demanding. But as a conclusion am I still positive to what I'm doing and I really try my best to keep a good mode. It's alos getting better as more rutines I've got. So I try to not think about all negative sides how's bothering me and instead think about all the possitive like all the new people I have meet my english improvment and all the experience I'm going to gett during this semester.
