There are many funny names that we cannot even imagine such as Pilot Inspektor. There are also names like Apple Zuma. We often make fun of them and it is really fun to talk about. But would it be fun to those who have ridiculous name too Most people would not agree with that. Because a funny name can be a good reason to be teased and it is hard to live for even grown ups. As most of you would agree the best and easiest way to make fun of other people when you are a child is teasing with their names. When I was a middle school student one of my classmates was Gangnamgu it is a name of district like Manhattan in Korea. The middle school was in Gangnamgu so whenever we write the address of our home or our school we teased him. Usually we teased him until he get upset or angry. It must be a bad memory of middle school for him. Even though the people who have funny names grow up there are some ridiculous problems with their names. Once I saw a man whose name is 'hello' in Korean at TV. He said that he cannot make an account at internet site. Because sign up system thinks his name is fake.
