I will be meeting with students who want to participate in a picnic . And I will suggest that the picnic is in the Moraine Park for two days . One of these days we are going to spend in the lake where is near of the park. Every student should pay twenty dollars to buy some food some fresh water and some things for grilling such as matches charcoal and pieces of spiced chickens. Students should fetch clothes for swimming. I think we do not need a tent because we are going to reserve a cabin
