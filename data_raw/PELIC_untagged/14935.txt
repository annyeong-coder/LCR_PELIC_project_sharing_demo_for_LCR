My partner is ANON_NAME_0. His name means someone choose . Because he is a doctor he likes to be called Dr. ANON_NAME_1. His nickname is same as his last name ANON_NAME_2. He would like to be called ANON_NAME_1 by his friends. He thinks his name is very comfortable very easy to speak and easy to remember. Nobody has same name as him in his family but his name is very common in his country. He comes from Libya. Right now he lives in Squirrel Hill Pittsburgh. He wants to improve his English by studying in ELI. When he finishes his ELI class he will apply for school to get his PhD degree. His hobbies are traveling and reading medical books. He is a very nice and quiet person.
