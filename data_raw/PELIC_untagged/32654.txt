My room which I use when I was sophomore was a studio. However there are a separated kitchen and bathroom. My room was so small. If two men lie in my room it is so full that anyone can't come in the room. I didn't like cooking. I had refrigerator but there was only water and beverages and some alcohol which my friends drank. I had a lot of equipment for exercise such as tennis racket balls for tennis soccer basketball clothes which I wore when I exercised. My room couldn't receive sunlight because buildings around my house was higher than my house. Even wind avoid my house. Therefore my room was so cold in winter and so hot in summer. The reason which I lived there although there was so many discomfort was the price of the room. It was about 200 which is included utility. In addition location of my room was so closed from my university so I could retrench transport fee.
