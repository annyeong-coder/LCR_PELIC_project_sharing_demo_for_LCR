In my country there are alot of people who need to buy cars. But that will affect on the environment because they will make pollution on the air. The government tries to keep the enviornment clean from the pollution. Keeping the environment is important to live in healthy life. It think using the bikes is good or riding the buses is brtter than using every one own car individully.
