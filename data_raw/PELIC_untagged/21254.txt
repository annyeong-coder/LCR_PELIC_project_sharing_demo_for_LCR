I have an experience about using different varieties of English mentioned in Mother Tongue happened when I am studying in the U. S. For example when I am talking with my Thai friends I do not have to be careful with the final sounds and pronunciation because we can understand Thai accent very well and we can figure out Thai pronunciation. For this reason it cannot help me to cultivate my English skill so I decided to mingle with international students instead of Thai students. I have to remind myself when I am speaking to students who are from different countries I have be careful and amend my pronunciation if I said it wrong in order them to understand what I am trying to communicate. I cannot use my accent arbitrarily as I speak with Thai so I think English throws me off and makes me feel uneasy.
