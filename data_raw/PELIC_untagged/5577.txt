There are three experiences that I had never done before I came to Pittsburgh. Fisrt I had never caught a sever cold that I caught last December before I came to Pittsburgh. That's because Pittsburgh's weather was too cold and I was so tired by moving from my country to here. Second I had never met Saudi Arabian before I came to the U. S. It was my first time to meet Saudi Arabian when I attended my first class. Last I had never played teniss before I came to Pittsburgh. When I played tennis at first I was so excited.
