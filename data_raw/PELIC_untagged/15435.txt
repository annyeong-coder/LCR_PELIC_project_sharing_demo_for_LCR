My husband and I live in Pittsburgh with my daughter. He loves my daughter and me very much. He always wants to have much time with us. Although we live together and love each other we have similarities and difference in many ways. Our hobby and appearance are similar but our personality is very different. My husband and I look similar to each other. For example he and I are medium height with black hair and smooth skin. He fell down in black curl and his head is covered with nice black hair. He is lauded for his smooth skin. We also have the same black eye color. In addition my husband wears glasses and so do I. My husband and I love to have a time together. We usually take a walk with daughter every weekend. We love to talk while we are walking. Also we enjoy watching TV such as desperate wives and CSI because they are very entertaining and exciting. In addition another reason that we like watch the shows is that it can help our English listening practice. Although we have a lot of things in common we have some differences. My husband's personality is different from mine. My husband is talkative and sociable but I am not. He loves to talk to me and his friends. He also likes to discuss about various social issues with me. For example protesting to import US ground beef was one of the biggest social issues in Korea at 2008. He liked to discuss about the pros and cons of the protesting with me. My husband and I look similar appearance share the same hobbies but our characters are different. I think if we were perfectly similar to each other our life would be very boring however although the differences are not always enjoyable things we are really enjoying our different point of view on our lives.
