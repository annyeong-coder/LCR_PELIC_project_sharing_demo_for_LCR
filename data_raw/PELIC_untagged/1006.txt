Personnal Letter October 19 2006 Dear Lingling I recently bought a new computer and I was so excited so I want to tell you about my new computer . My new computer is laptop . It is smaller than desktop computer . It is easier to carry out because I can bring it to work with battery . Also my laptop is more exquisite . On the other hand my new laptop is more expensive than my former desktop computer . I spent most my one month salary to buy it . However when I use it to do my homework and search new information . I feel so fresh and satisfied . I hope you can visit me as soon as possible If you visit me I will show you . Best Regards
