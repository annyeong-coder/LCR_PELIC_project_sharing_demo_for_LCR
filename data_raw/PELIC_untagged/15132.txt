My Living room My living room is a very nice place. It is square. When you enter the room the first thing you notice is the big table in the middle of the room and on this table there are three candles. Front of you there is a dresser. On the dresser there are two lamps and there is a beautiful picture above the dresser. On the left there is a single chair and on the right there is a red sofa. I think it is a regular room.
