The office The manager of the company and his staff met in the conference room to coordinate their trip to Niagara Falls. In Niagara Falls they will attend their colleague's wedding. The boy friend and his girl who works in the company drove to Niagara Falls. Also the company's staff drove with their manager to the wedding about five hours. When the manager and his companion arrived to the hotel they found that the manger's room was checked in by someone else. Then the girl's parents arrived to the wedding and met the manager while his companion was talking to some children about business issues. The boy friend delivered his speech in the wedding to welcome the attendance but he did a big mistake. He disclosed that his girl friend is pregnant. This made the girl's grandmother angry. Thus the manager met the grandmother at her room and made up this situation. Finally everybody danced and had fun.
