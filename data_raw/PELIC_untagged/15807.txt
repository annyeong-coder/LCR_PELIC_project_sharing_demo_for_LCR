Every year thousands of new students come to the United States to join universities around the country and a lot are questioning the idea of the students working in here while they are pursuing their academic degree. Many are arguing that these students need to work in order to afford the high expenses level in here while other are concerned with the low wedges that students are wiling to accept which will increase unemployment among Americans. Firstly it's true that it's not easy to live in the states depending only on a salary from the students' parents or whoever is paying for him here without an extra income to help with his expenses. But if we look at the jobs that these students are taking we will see that most of them are low income jobs that are much needed by American students who do not have anyone to take care of their expenses. Therefore American students will need to work more than one job for a very low salary which is in my opinion not fair since they are in their country and they should be doing much better than that. Secondly it's hard to integrate the students into the work force since every country and the U. S is no exception is facing a difficult time lowering the unemployment rate of its citizens. Students whom are willing to work for minimum salaries are putting extra presser on the U. S citizens since the have to accept job offers that are below expectations just so they can survive in the market. An example of which American companies are concerned with the salaries that they are paying right now is the fact that many of them taking their business overseas and building their factories in southeast Asia because of low hourly pay over there. To conclude I strongly believe foreign students should not be allowed to work in job other than a non paid job in order to keep the unemployment rate low and help citizens find jobs that are will paid.
