I did activities which were adjective clauses and prepositions. They were very helpful because there are many exercises and examples. Also I can read grammar rules and explanations for each topics before I do exercises. I learned some things about prepositions I didn't know it before. For example when I can use in on or at. I did not know on is used for smaller periods of time and in is used for larger periods of time. . They were confusing but now I learned a lot from these websites. I have to study hard on these topics. In addition there were two topics I need to learn more about them such as agreement and articles. Articles is too difficult for me. I need to do more practice. Agreement is not too difficult but sometimes I do mistakes so I need more practice. Finally there were many activities I had no time to look on them. I will read about them in my spare time.
