Happiness is a target that everyone wants to achieve. Different people have different perspectives about happiness. Some people feel they are happy because they are healthy wealthy or have a high salary job. Some people believe that they will be happy if they have lots of money. Money plays an important role in our everyday life. But money drives people to steal and to break the law. A lot of people became criminals just because of money. In my perspective people can't do anything without money but money is not everything. If a person places money prior to anything else he may lose friends or even the care from his family. If this happens money only brings him loneliness not happiness. Some people believe that they will be happy if they have a high salary job. But many people get a job just for high salary not what they want to do. With working for a long time to fulfill work many people will feel bored when they are working. They would not feel happy when they are working. In my perspective people must find a job which can make them feel joy not just for high salary. Some people believe that they will be happy if they are healthy. As everyone knows being healthy is very important to everyone. Without health even someone is very rich he still can't enjoy his life. Many people work hard because they want to earn more money but they ignore healthy lives. And they still can't feel happy in their lives. Different people have different ideas about happiness. In my perspective happiness is healthy life have an enjoyable job not just wealthy.
