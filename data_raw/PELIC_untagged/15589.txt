I think this article emphasis the idea of friendship and respect. First it appeared when the coach didn't consider the foal just to allow Johntel Franklin a high school basketball player who has lost his mother that day to play with the team. It also shows through his team reaction they accepted him without arguing. The competitor team showed as well a huge respect and sympathy toward Johntel they agreed to miss the shots of the penalty You realize you're going to miss them don't you . . . He understood what had to be done. And play an honest game. I think the coaches and the two teams did the right thing they allayed this teenager's misery.
