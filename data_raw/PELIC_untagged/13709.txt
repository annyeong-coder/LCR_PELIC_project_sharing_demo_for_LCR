I was in starbucks when I met my friend. He was looks like has aterrible. Because he has to change the area of study. I asked him when you will back home . He answered me I will back home when I finish my back home processes. What is you going to do after you back home . He said I will make contact with the college that I have been studyed my master's dgree in Malaysia. While I do that I'll restart my orientation to Malaysia. Really when he was talking to me about his planning I felt I will miss him.
