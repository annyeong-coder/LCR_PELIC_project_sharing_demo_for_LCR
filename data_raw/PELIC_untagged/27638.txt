My new room is bright warm and fragrant. This cheers me up because it make me feel I am in my home. Sometime I feel longly in my room I try to figure out what is missing At last I find out what's missing. It's my family's pictures. I pick out some picture from my family. Then I put them up on the wall. Every time I saw these pictures I missed my family so I always called back to my family. Now I love my room very much because everything was setting down.
