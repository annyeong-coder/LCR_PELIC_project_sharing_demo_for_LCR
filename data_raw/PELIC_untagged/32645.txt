2. I lived with my parents and my siblings whom you have met. 5. My brother slept on the livening room coach where I hardly ever saw. 6. It was a large old coach which my father had made. 7. My best friend who I loved her family lived across the hall. 11. They sold delicious bread and cake that people stood in line for hours to buy the bread and cake. 12. My brother and sisters whom I miss live far away now.
