I like to drink alcohol. Alcohol makes people feel happy. However everybody knows that drinking too much is harmful. And everybody who likes to drink must have one or two regretful experiences related to alcohol. When I was in college I belonged to a volleyball club. In sport clubs students always drank a lot of alcohol and competed to see how much and how fast we could drink. One day I drank at the party as usual. But perhaps something was different. I passed out for the first time. I woke to find myself in my bed the next day. When I met my teammate who had taken care of me and had taken me to my home he said just a word I was tired yesterday. I asked him What happened I should not have asked and he should not have answered. I knew that I had drunk too much I had injured my hand in the flame of candle on the table I had dropped and broken my glasses and to make matters worse I had vomited in the taxi. My teammate apologized to the taxi driver and paid an extra charge. The taxi driver must have thought I should not have picked up such a terrible customer . My teammate must have thought I should have told him not to drink so much It is needless to say that I think I should not have drunk so much . Nowadays it has become my good memory. And when I meet my teammates we always talk about this event as we drink.
