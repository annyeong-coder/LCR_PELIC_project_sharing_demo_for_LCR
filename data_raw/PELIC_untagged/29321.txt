If I had been born a boy I could have gone home late and not before 10 pm. I wish I were not a girl so my father would not always asked me be graceful quite and do everything like a girl. However if I had been born a boy I should have served in the armed forces approximately one year before I studied abroad. If I had soldiered I must have cut my hair every week because my hair grows fast. If I were a boy my peer might have had me smoke when we were adolescents. Therefore I wish I were a boy when I wanted to seek an adventure but most of time I am glad that I am a girl.
