1 A I think it's kind of a weird way to meet each other I've never tryed internet dating and I don't think I will do it in the future eather. To tell your friends and family that you met your wife through a internet match dating site it's not what I would like and I don't like to make up some white lies eather so. And then to just sit and pick someone that is going to become your wife after you assess her his profile it's not how it should work I think. The best way or my suggestion is to be outgoing stay possetiv be patient and take your time to get to konw your date if you do that will you find the one one day Something like that would I probably tell my friend. B 1. You have to tell you kids and friends how you actually met if you don't want to lie. Becouse I think it's nothing that I would be proud of. 2. The first impression of your hopefully future life partner is for his her profile online. And I think the first time you meet sould me in real life. 3. First time you talk to your again hopefully the one that you are going to married it's through the phone line. The same as number 2 first time you talk sould be in real life I think
