I am convinced that Martin really has psychic ability. First of all basically I believe that someone can get psychic power. There are a lot of strange things which can not be explained or understood in scientific way. In my country there is a woman who has psychic power and a documentary was made about her. I watched it long time ago so I don't remember exactly. Before I saw that I had never believed that. She has ability similar to Martine's she can find missing people. However Nickell a policeman who doesn't believe in psychic power insist that it's just retro fitting However I believe Martin because he was right too many times.
