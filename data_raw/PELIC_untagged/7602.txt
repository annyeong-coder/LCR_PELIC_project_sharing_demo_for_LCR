If I could live in any time period I would pick future. Technology Time machine find medicine Some machine can help you do housework I think live in the future would be excited. There are several reasons for my choice. First of all I can learn a lot of new technologies. Such as how to make time machine. If I can make time machine I can use it to shuttle back and forth past or future. I can change my life. I can correct my mistake. In addition I don't need to do housework by myself. I can use robot to do it. Finally I can find new medicine to save my family.
