Cultural Expectations of Success There are different cultural expectations of success for males and females. In the eastern traditional culture success for men usually means power and a successful career success for women usually means taking care of her children and doing housework. In modern society no matter eastern or western a career and power are the mark of a successful man. Many higher positions of the government and a lot of international company Chief Executive Officers CEOs are men. Any important decisions no matter domestic or international no matter private or public usually made by man. This situation prolongs many centuries. From the growth of a boy to a man our culture influences male should be strong and powerful. Although there are many traditional reasons but the main reason I believe is the result of our cultural expectations. On the other hand a successful woman usually takes care of her children and helps them grow healthy and manages a home in method. In the long history as our cultural influences those women usually stay at home so women act a small role in the societies. Taking care for her children is the main responsibility for women. If a child grows up with some achievements we usually say that the mother has succeeded. It's just the similar that our culture influences the growth of a girl to a woman as that to male. Although there are still a few successful women holds a higher position in the government and a few women are CEOs the majority of important positions are held by men. Many examples can show that men and women usually succeed in different aspects. It is the influence of cultural expectations of success for males and females.
