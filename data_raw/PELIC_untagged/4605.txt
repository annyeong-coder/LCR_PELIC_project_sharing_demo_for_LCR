I met Ramazan who is the best friend in my life while I was waiting the university registration line. While we were waiting the line Ramazan asked me some question about the registration form. That was the first experience to us. After we finished the registration we ate lunch together in the restaurant. I have enjoyed Ramazan and we decided to hold new apartment. We were living in a small apartment until we graduated from university. We went to a lot of good places with together while we were attending university. While we were travelling in Italy he broke his leg and he stayed in hospital 2 weeks. When he stayed hospital I accomplished him. He is really unlucky person. When I went homeland he got a big operation. While we were living together he cooked a lot of delicious food. I can't forget his macaroni. After he finished university he started job hunting and he found a good job. His is cumtoms inspector. As long I live I don't forget him.
