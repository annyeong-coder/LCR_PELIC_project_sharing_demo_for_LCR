When I am rich I'll have a fireplace in my bedroom. If I am rich I'll stop being friend with poor. Unless I am rich there is no point in thinking for a cozy bedroom. In case you are wondering I am doing my assignment half asleep. Because I am rich I get to fly 1st class to St. Louis tomorrow. After I become rich I'll buy a Porsche. As soon as I become rich I'll buy my own jet. Once I become rich I'll go on a world tour. Before I become rich I should finish my assignment because certainly I won't do it after wards Although I am very rich but I still like this trash can on which I am sleeping.
