Hello I am a student at University of Pittsburgh. I have been living in Pittsburgh for one month. I would like to share my plans and activities with you in this website. I have always been an excellent student I studied hard in high school and I got high grades. Also I have been working to achieve my goal to get in to the major that I want Health Information Management . I have planned for the whole semester and I made a schedule for each day in this fall. However I have participated in a lot of volunteering activities such as gardening Oakland serving food for the poor and lots of other activities. Also I have already singed for some classes to improve my English language. I have uploaded some of my plans to organize my daily schedule and I hope it's will help you too.
