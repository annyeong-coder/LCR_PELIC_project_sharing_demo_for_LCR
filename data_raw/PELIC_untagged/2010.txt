My comfort food is chicken soup because when I'm tired or ill I eat chicken soup and I feel better. My comfort food is hamburger it isn't healthy but contains meat bread and vegetable. I eat hamburger when I worried. My comfort food is potato omelette I like to eat the potato omelette very hot. I like to eat potato omelette when I have a lot of things.
