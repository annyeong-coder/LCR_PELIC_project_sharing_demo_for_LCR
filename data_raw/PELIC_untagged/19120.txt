Climate change is one of the serious environmental issues today. According to the facts the Earth's temperature has been increasing over the past years. As a result global warming leads to climate instability which is assumed to be a huge threat to our planet's future. This phenomenon impacts countries all over the world. In my country Saudi Arabia environmentalists have noticed many changes in our climate. For example we had snow in the north of the country last winter. Since Saudi Arabia is mostly made of deserts this is considered to be a strange event in such a country. Therefore there are many effort has been made in Saudi Arabia to help resolving this problem. For example Saudi government declared a huge fund to support clean energy research. In addition Aramco which is a big oil company has made many changes to protect the environment. For instance they have started using new kinds of filters in their factories to reduce air pollutions. Despite these efforts we still need to work harder in order to hopefully reduce the danger of this problem.
