My reminiscing I remember previous days when I was in my country. I remember when I wake up in the morning. After I take morning shower I used to read newspaper while having a breakfast. I used to take with parents during the breakfast. Then I was used to driving my car to work. As soon as I arrived at my office I used to check my e mail. Even though I like my work and it excites me working in the office every day would be boring. So I used to work in my laboratory every other day. When I see the student with lab coat in the university it reminisces about how enthusiastic work was in laboratory. My life has changed since I came to the United States ten months ago. I like to watch Spanish League for football. I used to watch the matches every Sunday but now my classes are a concurrent with match time. Furthermore I have ever seen snow until I came to the united state. Last January I was living in Philadelphia and I saw a snow. It is exciting in the beginning however now it bothers me when it is snowing. Ultimately I get used to dealing with snow.
