From my perspective I think studying in Pittsburgh is more interesting than San ANON_NAME_0. Some people argue that the region experience strange weather in winter and in summer. It is essential that you should adopt yourself to the weather in everywhere. Despite the fact that San ANON_NAME_0 is more expensive I believe Pittsburgh is lower cost and more appropriate for students. While San ANON_NAME_0 is far away from Spain Pittsburgh is nearest and if you decide to take a vacation to see your family in Spain you will save money time and effort. Eli have a great teachers and lavish classrooms. There are a lot of trips prepared by ELI for students each semester. You will enjoy your time in Pittsburgh and you will meet a new friends from all the world. It is your chance to enroll in exotic place such as ELI. Despite university of Pittsburgh is very old ELI is the best place to study language. I recommend to study here because the people here is very friendly and the city have a charming view with a beautiful rivers and bridges that attract anybody to visit this great city.
