Shogatsu is the most pleasant holiday of the year for most Japanese people. This special holiday takes place from January 1st to 3rd every year. On these days people go to shrines eat special food and spend time with families. Very early on the morning of New Year's Day people head to shrines with family or friends to pray for happiness during the year. Visiting shrines at the start of the new year is called Hatsu moude . Every year people wait in long lines starting on New Year's Eve. Along the path to the shrines there are many kinds of stalls which sell traditional things such as food toys and lucky charms. Enjoying the stalls people go to shrines to pray for fortune during the year. Then one of the greatest pleasures of this holiday is Osechi . This meal is made only for New Year's and it is packed into tiered boxes. For this meal women in families cooperate to prepare this which takes a long time. In addition this meal can be kept for several days so not only men but also women can enjoy this holiday. Finally this holiday gives us a good opportunity to visit with relatives. For this day most people go back to their parents' home and spend time. There is a custom that adults give money to children. This custom is called Otoshi dama . Through this custom people can enjoy relationships across the generations.
