I have been married for six years but I have known my wife for nine years. First I met her while I was studying in the university. I helped her in her classes and I answered some exercises in accounting for her. We talked a lot about our life. When I graduated she was studying in the same university I studied in before. After that we got married in 2003. Then she left the university while I was working in a company . Next the first baby was born in 2004 and the second baby was born in 2005 . Finally we live together in a small apartment but we feel happy.
