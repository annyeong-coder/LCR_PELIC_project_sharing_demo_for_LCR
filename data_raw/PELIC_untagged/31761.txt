From my perspective a studying at home has both advantages and disadvantage. On the whole I believe that it is a good choice for the development of our children. In my opinion the children acquire some positives from their friends. Moreover they can use modern service. For example computer labs and search a method in a library. In addition there is a social factor wherefore a studying at school decreases from autism and introverted. Because they play together. Furthermore some child need to a good teacher to explain complex issue. ANON_NAME_1 is my daughter some time when I studied her she said me I cannot understand. So there are many a professional teachers at school. Because some a lessons require to be a professional teacher such as mathematics. On the other hand some people claim that the studying at home is better than a school. To a certain extent they are right however they are afraid of their children to acquire the disadvantage of the school. As a result they prefer to bring a private tutor to teach their children at home. To sum up even though the learn home young has limitations it has benefits which outweigh its drawbacks. I am sure that it is new invention. I recommend all parents to educate their children at school because the child becomes a social who is learning from a behavior of others and easy way of explanation of the professional teacher.
