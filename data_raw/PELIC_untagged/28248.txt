I grew up in Kuwait city which is the biggest city in my country. There are many places that you can spend your time. For example Kuwait towers which are located near the coast are a famous in my country . Also there are many people who are very friendly. I grew up with my best friend who is living in my city. When you come to my city you see a big tower that is the fifth tower in the world.
