Jeddah where I grew up is a big city on the east coast of Saudi Arabia. My family moved there from vacation the winter I was born. I don't remember our first home which we rented from a relative but when I was seven we moved to the house I grew up in. This house where my parents still live is on a King ANON_NAME_0 Street in Saudi Arabia. To me this was the best place in the world. My mother had a big kitchen where she cooked. My tow sister slept in one bedroom and my older brother and I slept in the other. My youngest sister shared a room with my grandmother who took care of her a lot of the time. ANON_NAME_1 is my brother who lives with me in the U. S. My sister who lives in Canada calls me every day. I remember the time when I went to my country in December 2008. In September I want to Canada city to visit my family for a month. Saber has a friend whose name is Ail. ANON_NAME_2 who lives in Canada spoke with me. My best friend is Hamza how always tells me the truth. Hamza is a person who lives in Saudi Arabia. In December I went to Pont Park to study English for ten month. In our group there were five adults which were all language teacher from our school. They were the ones who they helped us when we had problems. Bethany who is much older then I'm become a really good friend. In my first week I went out all the time and I stopped going to my classes. ANON_NAME_3 who has studied Geology a lot helped me to get back into my studies.
