I'd like to have synesthesia. It sounds exciting without doubt. If I have a chance to activate two sensations simultaneously I want to hook sight and tasting together. My default flavor for red is sweet so did I identify a red pepper is sweet when I saw it For another example if I equated green to sour so did I consider most of the vegetables and fruits having a same taste sour As we know synesthesia is not an illusion I really saw a sweet pepper and taste a spicy pepper simultaneously. It is confusing and crazy but it is interesting. I really want to try it out. How can I know and explain to someone else what red pepper's taste like It is a complicated situation isn't it
