I have thought about being a designer because I like drawing and have lots of thoughts about making clothes or toys. But I didn't spend time learning how to describe my thoughts how to draw them and how to make those things. I didn't try to do what I want to do though I really like it. Now I've been thinking about what I should study so that I can get a job easily. And this is what my parents want me to do. So trying to make clothes or toys has become one of my hobbies.
