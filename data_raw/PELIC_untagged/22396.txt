Now . . I am very happy Sometimes God gives us the possibility to be happy again and now it's my turn. Two years ago I met my fianc ta Rbut now I'm learning a new language about other cultures and meeting new people and that made me very and proud. Finally I will talk about my future and the big change that will take place. I'm divorced and before I met Matt I never thought to get married again but God had other plan for us. When our relationship became really close and strong we understood that God did everything so that we were happy and therefore we needed to make new plans and get married and start a new family based on faith and his ways. In summary the last two years of my life made me change. I'm really happy now and everybody around me can see my new lifestyle. In other words they can see my new mood plans and future. It has been amazing to be in love.
