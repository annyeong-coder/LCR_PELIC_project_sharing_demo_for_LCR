Topic 2 Viewpoint B Some people might think that high school students should not have summer break therefore they can be more concentrated on their study. However I believe that students can use summer break to take a longtime trip for learning foreign cultures or languages and learn other talents instead of academic knowology. Using summer break to learn other countries' cultures or languages. They can choose one country that they like and in which they live for about two months to learn foreign lifestyle and language. Moreover they can meet friends who are native speakers to improve their language skills. They also can join their foreign friends' activities or festivals. It is a good time to learn foreign cultures and languages. Students can use summer vacation to learn talents such as survival training. It is very useful that people can save themselves even others when they encounter disasters. Survival training includes survival skills that are teached in class outside pratices and immidate reactions from hazard. Some training may require students go outside that is like a camp and let they use very simple tools that are found from nature environment to make a fire or a shelter. As a result students can learn survival skills that are not teached in school. Some people might think that students should use summer vacation to continue their study. By keep studying they can learn more professional knownology. However if they don't have summer break they will feel exhausted in their studies and even lose their enthusiastic on academic classes. They need a break to refresh their brains. Thus it will benefit students. Having summer break has bright and dark sides. It depends on students how to use their vacation. Therefore I recommend that students clearly consider utilizing their break whether they want to learn academic knownolgy in classes or other skills out of classes.
