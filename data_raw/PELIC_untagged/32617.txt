While many people agree that the countryside is much better for children's health and for their education I think that is better for children to grow up in a big city such as Chicago or New York city. In other words not only they can receive better education but also they can find many friends who help them to experience the culture. Certainly Living in a big city is really great chance for kids to get better education. In fact schools in a big city is good facilitated with many thing which support them such as projectors new computers large libraries which belong to the schools museums zoos. In addition parents have many choices for which school they are going to send their children. For example if I were a father I would send my children to language school to give them chance to speak many languages. Obviously children can make many friendships in the big city. This is because there are a lot people in the big city
