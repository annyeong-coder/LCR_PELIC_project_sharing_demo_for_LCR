Dear Mr. Xavi Thank you for your email and I will be happy to give you my perspective about Pittsburgh where I live meanwhile. Pittsburgh has a lot of places where you can practice your favorite activities. You can also go shopping in Rose Park mall which is one of the biggest malls in Pittsburgh. Furthermore Pittsburgh hosts several universities such as CMU which is one of the best universities in the world.
