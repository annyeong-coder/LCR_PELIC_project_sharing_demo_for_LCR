If I miss someone or something that is very important and I can't find it by myself I would accept the psychic offer. The reasons I accept it is because I believe some people have special abilities that other people don't have. With the special ability they can help us to find something important but we don't notice. Of course I will try my best to find it first but if I really can't find it I will ask the psychic to help me. Also I have heard some examples about people ask for psychic help and succeed that makes me believe if I really need help I can ask them for help. In conclusion there are so many things that can't be explained by science. I really believe some people really have special abilities and I would like to try if I really need help!
