I met a girl in ELI campus. Her name is Risa she came from Beijing last year. This is her first semester in ELI. She is a good looking and clever girl I never met before. She had a her PHD degree in China already. Now she is improving her English language in ELI . We met each other only one months . I think we have lot common senses. After we met we did some of fun things. We hang out dinner together to celebrate the Aug15th moon cake holiday last Friday. We went to Prime Outlets at Grove City doe ahopping last weekend. Risa wants to become a doctor in her future career. I hope she realizes her American dreams soon!
