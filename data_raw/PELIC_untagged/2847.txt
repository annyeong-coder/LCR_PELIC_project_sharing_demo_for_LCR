Actually my room isn't really sunny but I like it rather. Even when I turn on the light it's not really bright because I lke smooth atmosphere so I picked out a less bright lamp. And I alway put away my things in my room like books clothes and so on because if they are not in the right place I'm not able to concentrate on studying or reading a book and feel uncomfortable. In the class room I feel duty that I have to be really serious in the classroom and try to figure out all information as much as possible. And I like an atmosphere of discussion. I can find out more information with classmate by carrying out that I already know or listening other's explanation or opinion.
