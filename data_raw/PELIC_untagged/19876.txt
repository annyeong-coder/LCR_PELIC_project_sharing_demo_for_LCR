My home town is Pusan which is located in southeast of South Korea. Pusan is a port city therefore you can eat raw fish as much as possible. I miss fresh fish and seafood because I can't eat a variety of seafood in Pittsburgh. In summer I used to go the Haewoondae beach which is famous for its beatiful scenery. Near the haewoondae beach there is a suspension bridge that is the most longest in South Korea. When you come to Pusan in the evening you will see the shining bridge on the sea. In the center of Pusan there are some commercial centers. Many foreigners visit the commercial center since there are lots of souveniors and clothing. I'm so proud of my hometown. Pusan is one of the most attractive cities in the world!
