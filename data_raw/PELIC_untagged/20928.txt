By the time I arrived here I had never asked about this city. I didn't have a lot of information about this city. Also I didn't choose a good school for learning English because I started at ELS school. At the beginning it appeared to be a good school but after time spending there I discovered I had made a big mistake because I didn't choose ELI as the first school. The most important thing at that time was I had never considered about the TOEFL test which is the key to enroll at all universities at the United States.
