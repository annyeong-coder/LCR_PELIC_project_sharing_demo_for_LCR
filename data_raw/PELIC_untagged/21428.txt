Jeddah In the world there are many different places you should discover. In Saudi Arabia there are several interesting cities. Jeddah is one of these great cities It is the second biggest city in my country. It has a lot of interesting places such as Green Island King ANON_NAME_0's Fountain and Red Sea mall center. These places makes Jeddah an interesting place to visit. First Green Island is a fantastic place that you should visit. It is a sea food restaurant which has several glass rooms above the sea. Under these rooms the sea is colored with green lights this view is amazing. The place is romantic so that married people love to go there to celebrate their anniversary. The Green Island is an old restaurant it was found on 1990. However it is popular until today. After that you have to see the tallest fountain water in the world which is called King ANON_NAME_0's Fountain. It is a special place that has a wonderful view. The fountain is in front of the king castle. It is really high so you can see it from all over the city although it is more beautiful if you see it from a close distance. Finally you have to go to the Red Sea mall it is the biggest mall in Jeddah It is located near to the sea. In Red Sea mall there are all known international brands such as Coach Zara which is from Spain Aldo and more. Thus this mall is a great place for shopping. Also in the mall there are many big restaurants and it has a play area for children so all the family members can spend a nice time. All in all these places makes Jeddah the best city for me. I suggest to put Jeddah in your mind to visit it one day and I am sure that you will love it very much. The restaurant the fountain and the mall are special and incredible places. I wish I can go now to Jeddah because I missing it so much. I love you Jeddah.
