My opinion about the use of animals of laboratory experiments I disagree with using animals of laboratory experiments such as animals testing of cosmetics or medical science. I don't agree to do experiments on animals because I felt guilty when I knew the cosmetics which I use everyday cause many animals suffering and death moreover I am skeptical about the legitimacy of animal experiments. According to an essay from PETA People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals it indicates it's not necessary to do animal experiments because animals testing played no role in important medical developments like the development of anesthesia or the discovery of the link between cholesterol and heart disease. Besides compare with primitive animal experiments modern technology and human clinical tests are much more effective and reliable furthermore there is no guarantee that drugs which have been tested on animals are safe because the physiology is different between humans and other animals. In fact as the essay from PETA A 2002 report in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that in the last 25 years many drugs had to be taken off or removed from the market because they caused adverse reactions. As these reasons above I personally believe that using of animals of laboratory experiments is out of date unethical and inhuman and I never use those cruel products whose companies do experiments on innocent animals testing.
