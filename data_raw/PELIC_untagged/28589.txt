People and my relatives are shocked when they know that I am planning to complete my graduate studies in US. They were so worried as they will miss me and I will miss them. They asked me many questions. They asked me how long my study would take. Also they asked me if I planned to pursue PHD degree. My parents asked me how long the flight takes to get to US. One of my friends asked me If I could call him via Skybe. Another one asked me where I would study.
