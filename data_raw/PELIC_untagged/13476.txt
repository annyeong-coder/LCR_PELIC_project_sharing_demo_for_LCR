I have very bad experience with Chinese food. My worst meal that I have ever had was in a Chinese restaurant. Some of my classmates invited me last semester to try the Asian food. When we arrived to that restaurant I asked one of my friends to give me an advice about what should I choose She tried her best but unfortunately here advice was not very good because the food was so bad. The dish was a collection of steamed vegetables and pieces of steamed chicken. Actually I pretended that I like it because I wanted to be polite with my friends but the figured out that I did not like the food. For this reason I have phobia from trying Chinese food again. I know that I had bad dish and Chinese food may be better than what I have tried but always the first impression about anything controls the way by which you look to something. I hope that I can eliminate this fear and try Chinese food again. Also I tried the Japanese most famous food sushi and I did not like it but that Chinese dish is the worst.
