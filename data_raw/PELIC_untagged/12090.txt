Movies are regarded as the form of good entertainment. First of all we can learn about the many diverse cultures and history through watching movies. For example people who saw the movie The Gladiator were able to learn about the historical foundation and collapse of the Roman Empire. Also people were able to think how Roman gladiator had lived during that period. Furthermore movies can make possible many impossible things we can not achieve. For instance the movie E. T made by Steven Spielberg was able to awaken our imagination. Finally we can spend our free time joyfully watching comedy and romantic movies. These kinds of movies help us forget in the busy daily life. For all these reasons movies provide almost everyone with good entertainment.
