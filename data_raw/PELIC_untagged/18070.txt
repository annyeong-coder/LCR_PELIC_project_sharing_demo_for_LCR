First creativity is an intrinsic feature but learnign is something you acquir during your life. Second creativity alone can be good but should be grown by learning but in the same time if there is any well educated person who is not creative in my opinion he is useless. So both of the creativity and the learning should be integerated to make a real change in our lives. Just think about all the famous people and compare them with some very old professors who spent their lives learning in that time you will see the difference between learning and creativity.
