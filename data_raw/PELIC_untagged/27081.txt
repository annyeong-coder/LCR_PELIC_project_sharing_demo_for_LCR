I passed permit test on July. I had never been driving in Japan. Before the permit test I had studied a lot of things. I was so nervous even though I had studied. I asked to my friend who got driver license in America what kind of test she had . There are many different law between America and Japan. I had to learn a lot of things but I passed.
