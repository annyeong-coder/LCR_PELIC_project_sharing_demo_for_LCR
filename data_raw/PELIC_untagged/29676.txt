What's Wrong with My Mother's Mouth Do you believe in gods and ghosts As for me I don't believe them unless I really saw them with my eyes. Now I will tell a story about my mother. More than twenty years ago while our family were busy in building our new house my mother's mouth had the trouble to eat anything without any clear reason. She said that she believed in gods and ghosts at that time. Our neighbor also told us that we might have offended a kind of god called beam god and we should set off firecrackers to send the beam god away. We did all the things according to what he said. Unluckily that didn't work and my mother's mouth still couldn't be opened freely. After that we invited a famous witch in our town. She told my mother You must be followed by ghosts. Then she did something to drive the ghosts away. Obviously she failed to do it. During that period my mother didn't stop the doctor's treating her disease. Fortunately the doctor changed the medicine and use a new one after some time of no positive effects and my mother could open her mouth in the end. She suffered a lot and said that she finally realized there was no ghost in the world. However she didn't stop believing in gods and just believe but not too much. Maybe that's right. After all people need some belief to live actively and well.
