Chinese is my mother tongue. As the same as Amy Tan I used my language in different ways to talk to different groups in my country. Often I told to my relatives good friends and familiar colleagues in informal Chinese. Especially I preferred chatting with my good friends with puns hyperbole and sarcasm and we have never hurt each other's feelings. For example I have a good friend who is much taller than me. I remembered someday I had an appointment with her and I didn't meet her right on time. When I came she told me she could pardon me for my short legs. Moreover she reminded me to wear high heel shoes so that I could match with her. One of my good friends sprained her ankle and walked with a limp. So I laughed at her that the earth was really not even. However I made formal conversations with my general colleagues leaders. Usually I told to them logically and grammatically. Now I am in the U. S. I have had lots of conversations with native speakers who can speak Chinese and would like to talk to me in Chinese. I tried to use simple Chinese words to make not exactly grammatical sentences to talk to them. My speaking speed was slow.
