If I hadn't study computer science as a major I would have been a civil engineer. Although at the beginning it seemed as a good idea it wasn't. If I hadn't informed myself about the types of jobs these professionals perform I would have made huge lifetime mistake. If my parents didn't meet a civil engineer called ANON_NAME_0 who travels around the world constructing electrical dams I wouldn't have spoken to him about his work. If I hadn't spoke to ANON_NAME_0 I wouldn't have realized on time that most of the time civil engineers work far away from the city and their families. Being so young at that time if it wasn't for the talk I wouldn't have noticed that with the time I would like to establish a family with kids and that I would like to spend time with them. In addition I wouldn't have realized that I love living in the city and that I can't stand being dirty all day long and using those construction boots that make your foot smell. If it wasn't for my parents who realized faster than me a job in construction wasn't for me I wouldn't have spoken to someone as prepared as ANON_NAME_0 and as a result I probably would be frustrated with my professional life.
