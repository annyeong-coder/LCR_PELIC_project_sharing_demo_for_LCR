If you Study English as a second language take iBT TOEFL preparation and practice the strategies for reading listening speaking and writing you may pass the TOEFL exam. First of all studying English as a second language is one way help you to pass the TOEFL exam. If someone studied English as a second language he would learn English bases and how where when use every base in a correct way. Also he or she will able to demonstrate the questions in the exam because he or she knows if the questions about the person area or the time. In addition the categories of words that he or she learned while he or she is studying will help him or her when he or she will take the exam. After that taking iBT TOEFL preparation is another way helps you to pass the TOEFL exam. If he or she knows how the exam looks like and tries to do it one or two times as a result it will help him or her to get high score in the exam.

Because someone learns a new strategy and he or she doesn't use it he or she is going to lose it or forgot it.
