In our life there are a lot of important things that we have to do or have it. Actually it depends on the people. In my opinion the three most important things in the life are a religion education and have a good family. First thing that I think it is the most important is a religion. You have to know about your religion and study it to have a great life if you believe it. Sometimes people changed their religion because they think it's not right so you have to know every thing about yours. The second is an education. To be a good person you have to be educated. I mean you can not have a good life without education somebody has but it's unusual. If you want to get a good job and make more money you have to get a big degree like bachelor master's or BHD degree. The third is having a good family if you have what I mentioned above you will have a good family. When you have a good family you will be able to have a nice life. You also will be happy. Cause of I organized them by this way if you know well your religion and you're educated that means you are able to have a good family by teach your children their religion with a good teaching way.
