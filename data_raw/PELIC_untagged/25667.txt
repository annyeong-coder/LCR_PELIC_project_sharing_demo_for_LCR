Hilton hotels It's a place that I would never for get it happen on fifth of April just twenty days before I come to Pittsburgh one of my friend decided to get a suite in the Hilton hotels in Jeddah because his wedding party so he asked me to get it under my name because I have a discount from my job I told him I would get it for you unless you take one day in advance to have his bachelor party there. When we went to the hotel entrance I got chocked because that was the first time that I recognize this massive building from close view. The hotel built in a circular shape so you wouldn't know where is the other side heading. When I got inside the entrance gate which is a seven meters height and four meters wiedth Contains from a smoke brown color and a golden metal made as a tree branches. And the dim light in every where comes from a three floor height . The reception is very big and there are only two curve desks are covered by leather The gust chairs are in the middle of the reception desk All this in the right side of the entrance. The left side is a huge three elevator takes you to the fifty floor I wonder all that huge building and there are only fifty floor but I found out the firs five floors is a hotel utilities. The room is two big for two persons first I cace I didn't know where it located it's about a curvy room with a fifty two plazma t. V on the left side on the room with a small referigtrator in side of the wall . On the right corner there is a really big bathroom with a jacozy bath on it. The bed is king side with a four column and curtins . The window side is located on the sea view so that you will be on the sea side. Finally I couldn't take that extra night for the party because of the extrame expensive price.
