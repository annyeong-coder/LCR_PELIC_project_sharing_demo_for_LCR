I am an introvert who needs a great deal of time alone. Unlike a shy person who avoids social encounters out of fear I just prefer to savor a moment of silence in my life which is already full of noise. There are plenty of solitary activities which I often take pleasure such as reading writing drawing dancing playing the piano and watching touching movies. On the other hand I like to work independently and concentrate on a single activity at a time with my own thoughts. Therefore I do not like to party on the weekend because I always easily get tired with too many others around especially at a noisy party or somewhere makes me the center of attention. After being with people for any length of time such as at a party I need time alone to recharge which means to feed my soul alone. Maybe it is true that introverts feel an increase of energy when alone but a decrease of energy when surrounded by a large group of people. Nevertheless I do enjoy interacting with a few of my close friends whom have touched my life. Living in an extroverted world which keeps pushing me to be very flexible I think I have learned how to speak and survive.
