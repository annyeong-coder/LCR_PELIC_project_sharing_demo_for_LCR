I got my driver's license 3 months ago in my country. I had been taking buses before I got driver's license. I went to a driving school to prepare for a driving test. I had had trouble changing lines so I had considered giving up the driving test. But I really wanted to get driver's license to drive a car in America. So I practiced hard and finally I could get driver's license in a short time.
