I used to wear skirts when I was a child but now I never wear it. I have one skirt but I don't like it it's not comfortable. Then I used to love barbies. I had three barbies they accompanied me. But now I don't know where the barbies are My parents used to take me to the steak house. But now they don't because they are vegetarians.
