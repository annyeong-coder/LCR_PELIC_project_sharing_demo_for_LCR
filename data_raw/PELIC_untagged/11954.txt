I am going to introduce how to make Tteokbokki. Tteokbokki is very famous food in Korea. Especially it is a popular dish among students. You can enjoy eating it anytime because it can cook easily and simply. Now I am explaining the way of making Tteokbokki. At first you go to the grocery market. And then you have to buy rice cake and hot pepper paste and some fresh vegetables such as carrot cabbage onion and green onion. Before cooking it's better to soak rice cake in water. If you are ready to cook you fry some vegetable in oil first. And then you pour two cups of water in the pot and put some hot pepper paste. Maybe water change red. When water is boiling you put everything like rice cake fried vegetables. At this time you have to stir it. Unless you stir it it maybe sticks on the pot. And you wait until boiling again in stirring water. When it is almost completed you put sugar in Tteokbokki. Sugar makes it delicious. I think it is so easy to make Tteokbokki. If you invite someone in your home or would like to introduce Korean food it is a suitable dish for you.
