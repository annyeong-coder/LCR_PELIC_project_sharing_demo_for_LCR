Could you suggest good idea for me Hello first of all you might not be late to save your money yet. If you make a plan well now you will be able to save money in the near future. In order to plan your budget efficiently investigate all your expenditure. You could find unnecessary coast. Then reduce your credit card. I recommend for you to use at most 1 credit card. In addition you ought to write your household account book everyday. It is helpful for you to reduce unnecessary coast. Lastly I should go to your principal bank and open your saving account or invest your extra money to saving funds.
