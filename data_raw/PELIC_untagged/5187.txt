When I was in Korea I used to play Korean style pool. However when I first came U. S. A. I couldn't do any hobbies because I had lived in Maryland for 2mouthes and I didn't know anything. After I moved in Pittsburgh I could make new friends and I could try to do some hobbies. So now I have lived in Allison park city and I can have several hobbies. For example I have been playing ping pong since I came here and I have gone to the bowling with my friends also I have played tennis near my house. It's good for me. Indeed I have been cooking since I came here it's also another own hobby.
