I've just finished from updating my personal website. I put my children pictures there. I've been thinking of add my relatives kids pictures also. I haven't posted the latest news yet. Actually I've been trying to organize a section for my special cook recipes since a month. One time I conducted on a video how to make a kind of appetizers. Then I uploaded the video on the website. I've never though that the idea of creating some videos of preparing dishes would get a lot of acceptance.
