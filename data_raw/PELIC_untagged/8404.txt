In Korea there are few spaces to throw trash away. Whenever you walk in the street you will be able to discover a lot of trash there. The trash problem is the big issue in Korea. There are several solutions to deal with the problem. First we should separate trash into small parts like bottles plastic things and cans. We should not discard all trash into the trash bag. After we divide trash into bottles plastic things and the cans we can throw the trash away. Second we have to decrease disposables. If we use disposables we will have to throw away after we use it one. If so the number of trash will increase drastically. To reduce it it is necessary that we should not use disposables from now then on. All countries have the trash problem. Therefore we have to try to reduce trash like dividing trash into small parts and reducing disposables.
