Obese children are at high risk of becoming overweight and obese adolescents and adults placing them at risk of developing chronic diseases such as cardiac diseases and diabetes later in life. They are also more prone to develop stress sadness and low self esteem. Children become overweight or obese for a variety of reasons. These causes can be either hereditary or acquired. There are many causes of obesity in children the most common cause is genetic factor. This can be transfer from generation to another. For example children whose parents or brothers or sisters are obese may be at an increased risk of becoming overweight or obese themselves. Moreover obesity problems run in families but it can be because of sharing the same family behaviors such as eating of unhealthy food activity behaviors and lack of physical activity. Obesity also can be caused by a medical condition such as hormonal disorder. A child's total diet and activity level play an important role in determining his weight. Many children spend a lot of time watching T. V or playing computer and video games and being inactive all of which can lead to obesity.
