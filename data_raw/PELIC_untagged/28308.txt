My friend Salma who I met last year when we were in a trip to Orlando which is in Florida state that is in the south east of The U. S. We stayed at a hotel that is close to Disney World where we spent a wonderful time there. At the second day we went to Gatorland where is a fully working alligator farm that is really fun.
