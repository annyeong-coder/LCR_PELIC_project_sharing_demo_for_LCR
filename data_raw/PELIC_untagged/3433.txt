Having vacation is an important part in our life as students. In my opinion I agree with people whom prefer to have a short vacation during the semester. I do not mean that the people whom like to take a long vacation after the end of semester are wrong. Every body has his own thought. I don't bring my thought from the air. I can explain why I prefer my vacation during the semester within three reasons. First of all in the middle of the semester we feel tired cause of the works that we take during the study. For example when you get tired then you take a vacation you will return to your study with full energy. Second the semester is three or four months so you have to change the atmosphere of studying cause the length of the semester. Third and finally it is a good chance to visit somebody that you want to visit him but you can not find him after the end of semester cause of his circumstances. For example if you have friend who studies in another city and his family doesn't live in the same city that he studies in so you can just visit him during the semester because he will go back to his family after the end of the semester. In conclusion your body is not a machine. You must give it some rest to unwind. The vacation is the best way to relax your self. It is important to everybody kids teenagers or old people.
