This is my daughter's classroom where she enjoys her school life. Their teacher is introducing how to carve bumpkins which we use to be a Halloween decoration. Several kids whom we prepared a party for are sitting around on the floor. The bookshelf where we put all kinds of books stands by the wall. My daughter loved that day when they celebrated for Halloween.
