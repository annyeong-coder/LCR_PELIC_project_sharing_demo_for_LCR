Flow means ultimate state of creativity. When a child reaches the flow state he she gain a total absorption that can produce peak pleasure and creativity. How it's related to time in terms of creativity In this article the authors quoted Ann Lewis's opinion which is explain how flow related to time. First of all Ann Lewis said Children have the capacity to get lost in whatever they're doing in a way that is much harder for an adult. It means that children have the ability to become so totally involved in their activity. When they become totally involved in the activity they appear to become lost in time. Secondly Ann Lewis said Children need the opportunity to follow their natural inclinations their own particular talents to go wherever their proclivities lead them. In order to follow their natural inclination they need time. How long Because we don't know when a child becomes totally involved in their activities and reaches his her flow state we should give him her as long as possible which is an open ended time. We could disturb his her concentration if we interrupted him her. As a result the child could lose his her idea and it would make him her frustrated. My experience when I was in elementary school could be a representation of how flow related to time in terms of creativity. I played with my cousin and we both drew something. I was very concentrated and so involved in what I was doing. I really enjoyed it. I made a sound while I drew such as made a kind of sound when I drew fallen leaves another sound when I drew sun etc. I didn't know how long I did the activity. Then another cousin came asked me to play with dolls. Her interruption disturbed me. Consequently I lost my idea felt frustrated and lost my enthusiasm to continue my drawing.
