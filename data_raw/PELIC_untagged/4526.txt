I met my friend Sangyoung who traveled Europe with me when I was a freshman at university. First time we met is not special. My university was women's university. Therefore there are no men. So we had to make a opportunity to meet men. Sometimes we had a blind date with groups. We called such a date Meeting . While my friends and I were sitting at the bar sangyoung came in. After she came in the bar some guys arrived at the bar. We had a great time playing board games. After dating rather girls got more familiar each other. And Sangyoung and I could be a good friends.
