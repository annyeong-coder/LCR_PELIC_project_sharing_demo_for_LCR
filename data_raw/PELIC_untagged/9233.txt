My sister isn't only a very beautiful women she is also humble for insisting that most of her friends don't know that she has the best grades in her classes and she is patient. She isn't high tempered. When she encounters unexpected occasions she can calm down. She tries to find solutions. Then she is a very courageous. She came to the U. S by herself.
