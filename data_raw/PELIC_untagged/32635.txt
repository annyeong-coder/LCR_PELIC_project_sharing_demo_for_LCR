1 I'm from Riyadh which is the capital of Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. I was living with my family that consist of my father and my mother and one sister and one brother. Our house which was in Riyadh was very big. I used to stay at my room which had a nice color. My room which had two beds was bigger than my brother's room. As a result my brother who is bigger than me spent a lot of time in my room. We hanged a lot of posters up that related to my hobby. In fact I liked the posters which we put in my room at that time. 2 He is wise who can make a friend of a foe. From my perspective I think this means that it's very difficult to change your enemy to be a friend but it possible and if you did it that mean you are a wise man.
