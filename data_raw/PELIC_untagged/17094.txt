Effectively time management is the key to keep up with college classes. For example by deciding things that you are going to do for the next day or week prevent you missing any college classes and you will be able to follow up with everything. Another strategy is to set the alarm o'clock 15 minutes earlier than the exact time before going to bed. Finally a really bad habit should be quit to keep you with your daily schedule which is drinking coffee at night.
