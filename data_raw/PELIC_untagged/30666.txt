Before I came to Pittsburgh I had never used the public transportation. Now I use the public transportation every day. In addition I had read about transportation network before I moved to Pittsburgh. On the other hand I had never eaten fast food before I studied here. For example before we lived in Pittsburgh me and my wife we had never enjoyed watching football.
