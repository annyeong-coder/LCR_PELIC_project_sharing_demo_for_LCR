I think that's good because I'd like a lot of people to know our natural environment and culture. We have colorful environment in the small land and our culcure isn't unveiled yet. I know some people still have the image about 150 years ago such as GEISHA or SAMURAI and that bother me for a question how is GEISHA or SAMURAI even I know just only history. And I think that means my country is so strange. If they come to my country they would modify their images and dispel what they feel strange. And then I believe people feel familiar to what they know and also I believe affinity is crusial to eliminate various misunderstanding.
