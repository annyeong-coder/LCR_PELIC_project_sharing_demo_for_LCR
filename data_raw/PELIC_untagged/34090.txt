Useful Things That I Learned in Writing 3 There are many useful things that I learned from writing 3 which are paragraph organization sentence structure how to chose the topic sentence signal phrases conclusion signals punctuation rules clustering using noun and pronoun consistency transition signals subordinators and finally essay organization. Regarding to which are the most useful and why I think this is depend on which skills were missed. When I talk about my self I think the most useful skills from writing 3 are transition signals and essay organization. Transition signals between sentences are words and phrases that connect the idea in one sentence with the idea in another sentence. For example first second finally furthermore in addition on the other hand however therefore thus as a result all in all to conclude to sum up and so far. In addition to these there are other ideas that can used to connect between paragraphs such as sentence connector as mentioned before subordinators although even thought etc and preposition despite in spite of etc . After I learned these skills I become familiar of sentence connection and paragraph connection which I didn't know about it before. The essay organization is new skill which I have been already learned it. I was writing essay before but not as good organization as now. What I hope in the future is to learn more skills and write with more profession.
