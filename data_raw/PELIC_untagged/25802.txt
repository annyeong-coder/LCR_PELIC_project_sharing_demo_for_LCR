There are many different things between when I was 10 years old and now. When I was 10 years old I could play all the time but now I never can. Also I was able to run very fast but now I cann't. But when I was ten years old I wasn't able to buy a house because I couldn't live alone and I didn't have money. I still cann't. But I can buy a car when I was ten years old I wasn't able to drive a car. Now I am able to create website surf the internet make charts and graphs. I wasn't able to do those things when I was 10 years old.
