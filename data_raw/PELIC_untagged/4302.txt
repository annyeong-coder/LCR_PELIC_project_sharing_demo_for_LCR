We have talked about traffic problems. I suggested to raise the tax for car possession or gasoline. That can reduce the car increasing. Someone supposed to increase the public transportation like bus subway and taxi. There are many people and companies in the city and the companies have same start time on working therefore we have rush hour in the morning. So we need to rearrange the starting time. In addition I recommended to encourage car full. That can also reduce the traffic problems.
