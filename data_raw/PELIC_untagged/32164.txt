Moreover I am a member of the Center of Excellence in Information Security COEIS King ANON_NAME_0 University. Studying my bachelor degree my interest in Master of Science in information security was initiated by my readings in this field. Working for 2 years as a T. A. At University Of Tabuk had also developed my skills in information science . I seek to pursue this field for my ambition to specialize in a highly professional and attractive field. My plans for my career have set this major at the top of my priorities. I am sure your school is the best place where my academic dreams will come true. Information security professionals are very scarce in Saudi Arabia. This area of study should make me one of whom contributes to filling that professional gap in the Saudi work market with the expertise I hope to achieve at your university. Opening to any interesting areas of Computer and Information Science specifically in area information security also having a scholarship from my government I found myself eligible to apply in your school.
