When I arrived here 15 days ago my cousin picked me up at the airport and then we went home. I met there my housemates which showed my room. I felt like home because they cheered me up and this was very nice. Few minutes later my cousin went back his home. After taking a rest I turned my room around also I hung up some posters and finally I put away my clothes. Then I turned on my computer and called my parents through Skype. It's was very exciting. The next day I got out of Home and went to many places in Pittsburgh. Then I went to the Cathedral of Learning and took the placement test at the ELI. Before that I signed up. That week before started classes I found out many interesting things in Pittsburgh. Finally 8 days ago I started classes at the ELI. I really feel so happy in my new home I enjoy everything but maybe I would like to fix my room up.
