There are differences between foods in Saudi Arabia and Other countries. Even though I have already tried many kinds of food I like Saudi foods because its taste is more delicious than other food. In addition Saudi food is as testy as Italian food. Kabsa is the most traditional food in Saudi Arabia. It is as filling as Indian food but it is not as spicy. Even though Mediterranean food seems more healthy than Saudi Food Saudi Food is testier than it. In addition Foods in the United States are less healthy than foods in Saudi Arabia. Even though Saudi food is as filling as American food it is testier than American food. American food is more expensive than Saudi food. Saudi food is more salty than American food. However it is not as greasy as American food.
