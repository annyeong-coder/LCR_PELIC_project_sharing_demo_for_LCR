In my opinion creativity should be encouraged by teachers when it appears on students. It is crucial enhancing instate of inhibiting their ability. I have an experience about that. For example when I was in primary school my friend got a nice toy and has some tools it was from another country I loved that toy but I couldn't get one like it. Then I borrowed the toy from my friend one day than I created one like it exactly by simple material. After my teacher knew about that he sustained my creativity during primary school and made competitive exhibition so I usually won. This example is a big evidence for the creativity should be encouraged.
