I think we shouldn't test on chimpanzees. Because they have feeling like us. They can feel hurt when we tested on them and they died. And animal is our friends and some people think they are their's family. If you have sister and scientists want your sister to be tester what do you do So it's not fair and right things. Chimpanzees have right. And Chimpanzees are the social animals so they cna not live well in the lab alone. So we should stop using them for us.
