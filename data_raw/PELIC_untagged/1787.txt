Every culture has its own style of design and living. Last week we visited two international rooms. First room was Syria Lebanon room and the other room was Early American room . Each of them has its own specific details and decoration. Both of them are good but there is big difference between them in everything decoration design and size. The Arabic room was small but it has beautiful decoration with ornamentation Arabic design. Also the decoration related to Islamic religion with some words of Al Quran. Words have written on the ceiling roof and some other words have posted on the side of wall . There was a Mihrab. It has placed there to show the direction of Makah when the people want to pray. The floor was very beautiful with a paved surface. It showed that room belonged to wealthy family. The other room was the Early American room. It was built from wood. Every thing inside the room built from wood such as chairs decoration bed and floor. It wasn't a room we can say it was a complete house . It has living room which has a table and chairs. It was used for eating and sitting while the family at home. It has also bed room and fireplace. It was showed how wealthy families lived in 17th century. The decoration of this was not like the Syria Lebanon room but the bedroom has a secret door that you can go through to the bedroom. They were using that as a safe place to hide when someone tried to attack their houses. The guide mentioned that there was ghost in this room and she said story about it. She said there was a man was chaining under the bed when he finished he saw a shape of person he was sitting on the bed. He was scared and he didn't tell anybody about what he had seen. Finally Early American room and Syria Lebanon room have its own style and each one of them has features. It is reflected how those early American wealthy families lived at 17th century and how the Syria Lebanon wealthy families lived as well.
