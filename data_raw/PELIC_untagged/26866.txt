How many people use English as a mother language or second language in the world The number of people is enormous and that is the reason for considering English one of the world language. For me English is also essential to enter the graduate school in the United State. In this essay I will discuss why I choose the United State for learning English and Why I live in Pittsburgh now. To start with I left my home country in order to achieve further academic performance. In addition I exactly knew that which country has the strongest education in my field. I really wanted to study in the United Stated because the U. S has had very creative and powerful educational system on Human Computer Interaction. There are also global companies that I want work for in the U. S such as Google Apple and Hp. Therefore last year I decided to go to the U. S for my dream and now I am here. Fortunately I was allowed to enter graduate school in Georgia states. However I had to give up my admission because of my marriage. I love one man and we did not want to be separated from each other. So I followed him to the Pennsylvania after my wedding. That was my turning points in my entire life since I made a difficult decision and dealt with a lot of obstacles in order to go to Pittsburgh. The most interesting one is that I did not have any information about Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania before arriving at here. Even though I was forced to live in Pittsburgh I have never complained about it. This is because I still love my husband and I begin to love Pittsburgh too. Moreover I can gain a lot of opportunities to start my study again at here.
