Some people pretend that girls cannot study sciences and technical subjects because they don't have the inherent ability to do it however if there are fewer women in technical areas of studies it is due to social pressure rather than natural differences. Thus girls wanting to pursue a degree in science are often discouraged to do it by their family. Moreover the fact that girls see only men in technical areas inevitably lead to a perpetuation of this fact. Indeed women miss a precursor which they could follow her steps. Since women have qualities that men don't have their presence in technical fields should be reinforced. Indeed not only diversity of origins and religion but also diversity of gender brings a lot to the sciences. Each specificity and each particularity brings a lot to the maximization of the scientific knowledge.
