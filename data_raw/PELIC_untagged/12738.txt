One of the best friends I have ever known is ANON_NAME_0. I have known him since secondary school. His family and he were living in the countryside where he was born. His father who works in a factory is my uncle's friend. ANON_NAME_0 bought a bicycle whose color was blue to ride it to the school. ANON_NAME_0 is a sort of person on whom you can always rely.
