My apartment was very dark originally. When I arrived at my apartment my apartment sometimes brought me down. For this reason I decided to buy another lamp at IKEA. Therefore I went there to pick out a new lamp. After I purchased it my room was more brighter than before. After that my room always cheers me up. Also I hung up my family photo on the wall recently. The photo makes me happy. Even though I am busy nowadays I always straighten up my room. Finally becase of a strong wind I would like to set up the curtains. I love my room.
