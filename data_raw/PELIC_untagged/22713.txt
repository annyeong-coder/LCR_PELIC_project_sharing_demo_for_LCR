A movie that I've seen recently is 2012 . The movie 2012 is about collapse of the earth happening in 2012. I have heard the prediction the collapse in 2012 frequently and have interest in that. Thus though I want to see the movie early I saw it two weeks ago. I expected the movie will be exciting but it's not much exciting. Time of the movie is too longer than I had expected. The thing not bad I think is only the main character's driving escaping split of ground caused by the earthquake. However the CG of the movie is not immature though CGs most of which in other movie doesn't look real. I think a reason the movie doesn't satisfy me is the subject the collapse of the earth really huge for human. Anyway I regretted I had expected.
