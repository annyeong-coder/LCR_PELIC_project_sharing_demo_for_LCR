I'd like to analyze my personality by using the four categories on the textbook. According to the first category I'm basically a sensitive and introvert person who wants to have my own time. I need my own place where I can take a rest and enjoy reading books or listening to music alone. In category two I belong to intuitives rather than sensors. Whenever I face some situations or problems that I should judge I become very instinctive. My husband whose type must be a sensor often says that I have a sixth sense which is very intuitive and instinctive. In the third category I am a thinker rather than a feeler. I like mathematics physics and even computer programming which means that I prefer the logical and reasonable way of thinking. According to the last category I am a perceiver. I prefer more exciting and unpredictable environment rather than predictable and boring world. Although these categories are interesting and somewhat useful to analyze my personality it's still not easy to decide my personality because my character has various aspects. Sometimes I'm very impatient but sometimes I'm very patient. My close friends whom I can rely on say that I'm a gentle and cheerful person. That's usually true although I'm occasionally careless and depressed. In addition my personality is also changed continuously. A few years later what type will I am I really wonder it.
