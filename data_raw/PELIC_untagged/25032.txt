I went to Giant Eagle and bought a little food. I bought many eggs bananas cheeses vegetables hams and break. I used these materials and became several delicious food. I cook a lot of salad soup and hambugers etc. I shared these food for a few friends. I wish everyone can give a great deal of advice.
