The children have the capacity to get lost deeply at anything that could grab their attention exactly opposite from the adults. For example if children visit a place like the children's museum in Washington defiantly the adult will interrupt the children at the middle if their exploring and they will stop and take them out of this because of the adults could be busy or tired.
