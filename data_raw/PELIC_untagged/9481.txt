Hello Everyone. I'm going to introduce myself to you. My name is Minsuk Last Name . I'm going by Min. These days I'm glad to study with my classmates. First of all I was wondering when my English level can be grown however I'm getting better on my ability for English language because I'm studying hard since last term. I wish that I could transfer to I. S. At University of Pittsburgh ASAP. Second my hobby is playing soccer so I usually enjoy playing soccer game every weekend. However I take pleasure in a new hobby which is watching television serial drama by my laptop. Now I recommend you my interesting drama How I met your mom. If you enjoyed watching the drama for growing English your choice would be the most effective methods. Finally I always dream forward to achieve my goal that becomes excellent engineer so I want to finish this term with the result of my efforts. I think that my classmates help me to make a lot of opportunities nowadays. Thank you Min
