Morocco has lots of different geographical features and a variety of customs. Simo is from Morocco. There are coastal areas on the Atlantic and Mediterranean Oceans. It is located near Spain in North Africa. My country weather was beautiful and warm. There are lots of Rivers and Mountains in cities. Also my country custom has remained in the traditional clothes of Morocco. They wore them on holidays. Men and women wore jelaba and caftan for a wedding a banquet and a festival Simo said me.
