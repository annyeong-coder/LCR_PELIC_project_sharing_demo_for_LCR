My hobby is decorating so I teamed up with my sister to do up our apartment as long as we received the key from the hostage. First I straightened all rooms up. The living room was pretty small because its walls were painted by a dark color. So we did it up with the light yellow painting. Now the living room looks larger. I like our apartment because it has a lot of windows. However it was too hot and bright in the summer day. We spent a half of day on hanging up the curtains for all windows. After that we filled up the empty room with a small sofa. It was difficult for us to find out the appropriate position to put the coffee table. After talking over we settle on a room corner to leave it. By putting everything away our living room looks neat and harmonious.
