I like to take my lunch or dinner outside. Sometimes we have a good meal other not. I can't forget our experience in Malaysia. We went to a local restaurant. At the beginning they welcome us very special received. When we read the menu we didn't recognize the food. So everyone ordered by the name of the meal who like. They served the appetizer. It was a fruit. They call it Dorian. I can't explain how the smell was. Maybe It was like a dead body. Then al of us can't stay a minute in that restaurant. After that we figure out why they put a logo in the left the Dorian is not allowed to eat in hotel. It was the worst fruit I have ever smell in my life.
