One day I lost my ATM card. When I get on the bust to go home I opened my wallet and I realized the ATM card is missing. I tried my best to remember when is the last time I used it but I couldn't. I figured out that I bought Iced tea in the coffee shop. And that was 3 hours earlier. I start to blame myself about it. Lots of negative thoughts roam in my head that it could be stolen. I called the Bank to cancel the card immediately. They charge me 7 dollars to issue a new one. In the next day I checked my email and there were a new message from an IT guy who work in g27 lab saying that he found my card in the lab. I didn't expect 1 that I can leave something in the lab. When I miss it I should relax and try to remember everything after the coffee shop. I must go back and look for it. I shouldn't blame myself. May be if I checked my email I might not cancel it. I ought to find practical alternative plans to look for it other than thinking in a negative way what could happen if someone find it he would steal my money.
