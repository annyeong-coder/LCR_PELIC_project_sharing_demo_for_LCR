The Smart Machine There are many inventions in the past century that have positive impacts to our life. These discoveries are ranged from very useful to less valuable one. In my opinion computer is the most beneficial finding for people. Computer is small machine that helps to create record and process any information with less mistakes. It is very valuable because it helps to make research easier to communicate and better business. In the past it had been very difficult task for scholars to find any information they want. It might take years to complete a research. However since computer was invented it has been easier doing research and may talk less than one week. People saved their research on CDs and sharing them with others to form a reference for any researcher instead of travelling to find relative information. Computer makes communication more convenient. Before they sent letters by mail and may take weeks or months. However as a result of computer developments sending emails takes less than a minute to reach the intended person. Businesses become better using computers. Many business's owners use computers to computing and to in store information for customers. Therefore they have less workers which leads to less wages must be paid. To sum up computer has made our life different. Easy access to information communicate with families and others and more convenient stores are available.
