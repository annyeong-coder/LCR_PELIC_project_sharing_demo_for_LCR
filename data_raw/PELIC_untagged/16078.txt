When I was a university student suddenly a friend of mine asked something to my friends including me. That was Did you do it well One of them replied Yes I did it but it was so easy. Others said Yes it was too easy. Really I don't think so. Did you already do it etc. I thought what he meant for a while. However I could not find out what it was so I asked him what he stood for it . He explained it that was a vote for electing representative of department. Then all my friends were embarrassed because they thought it was something different each other. Someone considered that it was homework someone it was a volunteer job someone it was to vote someone it was a move to another apartment one of us. That's right. All my friends thought differently but their answers seemed from same question.
