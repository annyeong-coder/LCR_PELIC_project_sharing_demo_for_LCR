Home is a place you grow up wanting to leave and grow old wanting to get back to. This quote means that most of the time people don't like their hometown because it is the place where they were born. They spent a big part of their life in that city so the desire to leave and to know new things is huge. However when we grow up and have new commitments we miss the time when we were with family and old friends.
