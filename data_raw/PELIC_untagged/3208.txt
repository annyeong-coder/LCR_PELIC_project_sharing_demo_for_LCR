In my opinion students should have several short vacations throughout the year. First of all most of students must be exausted after several months of studying. They might study without stopping but they must be tired of studying and could lose their health. So during the vacation they can recharge their strength and power to continue their work. Second Some studuents could miss the class or others could not understand what the teacher are teaching. Thus if they don't have a vacation their works will pile up without understanding. This might cause them to stop their studying. So they can make up the class during the vacation. The third during the short vacation they can get some more experience of real life without losing their pace of studying. They could get a part time job or participate in intership program. They can learn more things from this experience and they might get back to their school with more self confidence. In conclusion several short vacation should be needed for better students'life.
