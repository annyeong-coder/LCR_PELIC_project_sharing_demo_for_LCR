I was on london in 2007 and there was a celebration on oxford street on of the well known street on this city. I woke up late and I didn't know about the celebration I came as they started it. I saw the people are happy and with groups. I felt jealous and I called my friend to join me in the same area. The celebration had been working at late night. When my friends came we have had our dinner while we walking. It was a great night specially when my friends arrived. We have seen a lot of beautiful fire work and art on the street.
