Two years ago I was feeling upset about my ESL class at University of South Dakota. Meanwhile I met my English instructor Jerry at the Writing Centre. He taught me how to pronounce corrected my papers and encouraged me to talk to him. Every weekend he was opening his house for making a chance of conversation for ESL students. In the long Summer vacation he was volunteering to teach English for us as well. Under his helping I made a big progress in my English. Now though I have left him I am still Keeping in touch with him.
