Our family small trip to Riverview Park last weekend was very wonderful. First of all we had a nice view from the hillside in front of Allegheny County. We could see downtown Pittsburgh beyond a big and full grass land. It was really nice to have some lunch on the bench there while viewing the scenery. In addition to this one we also could enjoy hiking at the River View Park Loop Trail. We walked through the Cherry Blossoms Oaks and Maple trees lanes. The road was well cleaned and the air was also really clean. We saw Cardinals Blue jays and Robins. We were interested in listening to their different voices while appreciating the beautiful greens. Moreover it was FREE! We only spend money just for gas because we took apples oranges bagels and iced Columbia Coffee with us. I was glad to find a new way to spend holidays.
