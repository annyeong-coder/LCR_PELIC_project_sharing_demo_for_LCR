1. Baseball and softball are very similar sports. 2. Similar bats 3. Similar gloves 4. Similar rule of bases 5. Similar defended position 6. Similar shoes 7. Similar field Baseball and softball are very similar sports. First of all they have much equipment in common. For instance both baseball and softball can be hit by the same kind of bat. Second it is appropriate to use the same kind of glove to catch baseball and softball. In addition you can wear the same kind of shoes to play baseball and softball. In my country we usually play on the same field. However if you play a game both baseball and softball have similar rule for playing. Both of them have very similar defended positions. For example both baseball and softball have a pitcher a catcher a first base a second base a third base and a short stop in the infield. They also have a left field a center field and a right field in the outfield. But the softball has one more defended position in the outfield. The position is between with infield and outfield and it is changeable according the condition of the game. Finally I want to emphasize that both of them are my favorite sports.
