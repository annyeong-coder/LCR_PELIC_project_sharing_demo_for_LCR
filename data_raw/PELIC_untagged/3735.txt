Some of students are lazy to cook and eat at school so they become fat. There are many college students' diet have problems about the food are unhealthy and the prices are a bit expensive. College has a lot of food but it's unhealthy for students. The foods usually are fast food because the students don't want to wait too long time such as French fries hamburger and pizza. They want to make the food delicious so they put a lot of oil cheese and salt kinds of that thing in the food. We eat these things everyday is very unhealthy for us. For example my friend is a college student. He eats lunch at school almost everyday and he rarely exercises. Six month ago his weight was 140 but now changed to 170. Actually the foods' prices in the college are not so expensive. Maybe just some foods are expensive but most of foods are similar as outside. In my opinion some foods' prices I can buy more foods to cook at home. I think cook the foods at home is better than eat at school because we can control the foods not too oil and salt. The point is that we can save more money. College students have a lot of paper or homework to do but they still have to think about their healthy problem. Eat too much fast food will change their body shape and become fat. This is most college students have to think about it.
