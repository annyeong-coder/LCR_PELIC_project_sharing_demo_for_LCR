If I am going to live alone on a deserted island I will take the following items with me. First I will take a lot of fresh water because water is the most important thing to maintain our life. Second I will take fishing equipment because fish can provide me enough energy. Third I need portable TV set to get information. Forth I need batteries to power the portable TV set. Fifth I will take compass because I can use that to find out the direction. With this items I can survive on a deserted island.
