STRESS AT WORK OR SCHOOL CAN BE A SERIOUS PROBLEM. A PERSON SUFFERING FROM TOO MUCH STRESS USUALLY FINDS IT DIFFICULT TO BE PRODUCTIVE OR HAPPY. THERE ARE THREE SOLUTIONS FOR THE STRESS. FOR EXAMPLE RELAX SPEAK WITH GIRLFRIEND PRAYING TO GOD. THE MOST IMPORTANT TO ME I RELY ON PRAYING TO GOD WHEN I HAVE A BIG STRESS. GOD WILL BE HELPING ME IN THIS TIME. SO WHEN I PRAY TO GOD I FEEL BETTER AND THE STRESS GO WAY. SECOND I WHEN I HAVE STRESS I HAVE TO CALL MY GIRLFRIEND OR WIFE TO TELL HER ABOUT THE PROBLEM AND SHE WILL TELL ME SOME SOLUTION. THEN SHE SPEAKS WITH ME ABOUT THE LOVE. SHE WANTS TO MAKE ME HAPPY. ALSO SHE WANTS TO ME SPEAK WITH HER VERY NICE. IF THE STRESS IS VERY BIG SHE TELL ME THE FIRST PEOBLEM WHO I FIND A GOOD SOLUTION FOR THIS STRESS. FINALLY IF I HAVE STRESS AT WORK I WILL GO TO MY HOME OR A GOOD PLACE TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME THERE ALONE. YOU CAN'T DATIVE THE CAR BECAUSE THE STRESSES CATCH YOU THIS TIME. WHEN I WANT TO GO MY HOME I DON'T LIKE TO NOISY THING SUCH AS MUSIC TV KIDS AND ANOTHER PROBLEM. THERE ARE GOOD SOLUTIONS FOR ME. I WOULD SAY PLEASE TRY THE FIRST ONE. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR EVERYONE. THE STRESS COULD BECOME TO YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE WORKING VERY HARD OR SOMEONE MAKES YOU ANGRY. IF YOU HAVE A BIG STRESS YOU MUST TAKE RELAX OR A SHOWER.
