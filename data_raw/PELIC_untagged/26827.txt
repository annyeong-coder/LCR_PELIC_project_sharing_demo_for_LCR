The authors say there are some reasons which kill child's creativity. Surveillance competition over control restricting choice and pressure make that child don't like school. Teachers over control child and they are watching what they do and do well or not and then they just evaluate them. So child lose their passion to create their own things. Also they don't want to participate in school. When I was young teachers always tried to control me. But I really don't like to be controlled. So I also don't want to participate in my class even if they tried to make me participated. In additions if someone control me I just feel bad. So I was disobedient child. Also I often disobeyed my parents and teachers. Now I think that was not helpful me. However I still don't like to be controlled. So I agree with authors.
