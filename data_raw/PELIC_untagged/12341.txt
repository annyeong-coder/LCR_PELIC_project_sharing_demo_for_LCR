On August in the last year I had nice trip I went to Ghadames city. It is located in the southwest of my country. It's one of the pest tourist places in the country. My trip was at the end of the summer the weather was very hot. I went with my uncle's family and we didn't take any things we just took the most important things. We took a lot of water some food some clothes and my camera to take a few nice pictures. We stay there about ten days and we visited many places like old town the museum traditional houses the great mosque and we saw a lot of sand as grand dune. There is outdoor market in the center of the old town you can bay some traditional products as souvenirs. If you visit Ghadames someday you will not need to use the map because there are many guides to take you to the best places there and the people in this city very nice people. I think everyone he will helps you if you need any help.
