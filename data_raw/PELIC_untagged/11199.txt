I'm going to talk about my best friend Anna who was one of my college classmates. She is an extrovert person. I still remenber the exact moment when we meet for the first time. We were at the college cafe during the 10 minute breack between two classes and she was speaking with a group of people. As I went near to them I felt like she knew those people from a lot of time which was impossibile because we had been started classes only that morning! In a few minutes she was speaking also with me our frienship has started like that. She is also an intuitive because she is the kind of girl that understands easily how do you feel and what are you thinking about. Then I'm pretty sure that she is a feeler. Anna is the kind of person whose emotions come always out also when is not necessary! But she is trying to controll that! Finally she is a judger. When we travell together she tryies to make programs all the time and she always wants to know where we are goig to go the next day which make me a little nervous! But it doesn't matter I'm already looking for a place where we can go together when I'll be back to Italy.
