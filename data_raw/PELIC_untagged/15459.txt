I have watched Omer El Mokhtar movie which narrating a story about a hero from Libya. ANON_NAME_0 El Mokhtar who is seventy years old was fighting against the Italian army when they came to invade his country. He refused the occupation which made him the most wanted person for the Italians. The green mountain where he collected his soldiers is located in east of Libya. He was living in a small village which is called Solog. He was teaching the children the holy Quran. Omer whose hours was white had a family but the Italian killed all of them that made him very sad. He led many battles against the Italian which made him a Libyan hero. El Mokhtar whose heart was brave was hung in his village and in front of the eyes of his people that made the libyan people hat the Italian army. The Italian army which ANON_NAME_0 fought against occupied Libya for 35 years.
