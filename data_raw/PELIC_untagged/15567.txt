The favorite dish of our family is a cabbage soup Schi from the Russian cuisine. This soup is very delicious and easy to cook. I love to cook this soup on Sunday so we can eat it during a week. In my family we usually serve the soup with sour cream greens and dried breadcrumbs. If you want to cook this soup you should follow these steps. First you need to prepare all ingredients. Take one pound of meat pork or beef with bones one pound of cabbage one medium onion two carrots one large sweet red paper two celery sticks one can of diced tomatoes one tablespoon of olive oil and a teaspoon of each basil oregano and rosemary. Salt and pepper will be added to your taste. When you are ready you can begin. In the beginning fill a large pot with water and bring it to boil. Add well washed meat to the boiling water and cook over low heat for about two hours. While the meat is cooking chop the onion carrots celery and red paper. Then add olive oil to a pan and saut a epper oregano basil rosemary and stir the mixture over low heat for 10 minutes. When the meat is ready separate it from the bones and slice sift the broth through a drainer. Next cut the cabbage on small slices and put them into the broth. Finally add vegetables and slices of meat to the pot and cook for another 15 minutes. Schi is a great dish for a whole family it is easy to make and requires simple and inexpensive ingredients. This soup can be stored in a refrigerator many days without loosing its taste. You can eat the soup every day with all kinds of appetizers and side dishes. It is really delicious.
