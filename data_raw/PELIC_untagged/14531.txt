Oils are usually liquid in room temperature. They mostly come from plants or fish. Oils we use at cooking such as canola oil or olive oil are good examples of this type of oils. On the other hand solid fats such as butter or beef fat are mostly from animal foods or made from vegetable oils. While most liquid oils have a lot of monounsaturated MUFA or polyunsaturated PUFA fats solid fats contain saturated fats or trans fats that raises bad cholesterol levels in the blood. We need oils to keep our health because oils contain essential fatty acids that are necessary for our health. However we'd better take liquid oils instead of solid fats to control the bad cholesterol levels. In addition we should be careful in the amount of oils we take because oils are high in calories. Only 5 7 table spoons of oils per day are enough for an adult.
