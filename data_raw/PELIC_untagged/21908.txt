First of all in the article English seen as Co star among global language supports the idea that English is considered very important in the world. As shown in the article can English be dethroned English is used for diplomatic economic websites scientific studies among other things this explains the importance of language in the world today. However in the article English seen as co star in global languages explains that English will be removed or displaced by other languages simply because the dynamics in the world is changing while in another article argue that English it will maintain strong English as the main language. When talking about the widely used languages in the world the article of English Seen as co star among Global Languages said in many languages such as Arabic or India are growing strongly. On the other hand another article says that other languages are growing and organized but without removing the main English language. Finally when speaking of minor languages used in the world also differ because in the article Can English be dethroned said many languages in the world will die because they do not keep teach supporting the opinion of another article that explains that many minor languages may be doomed to extinction. In my opinion I think the article English seen as co star in global languages I found it more likely because it explains how the English being a dominant language in the world simply has been affected by globalization and growth many countries like China India Saudi Arabia turn this into a more multicultural world where English will remain the second most spoken language but other languages in constant growth.
