My living room. My living room are small and comfortable. Like most rooms it is a rectangle. When you walk in the door the first thing you focused is the large window on the back wall. The table is under the window. I maintain the light from window is relevant when you eat or read. To the right of the table I have TV. The sofa is directly in front of you and front of TV. The right wall is lined with bookcase where I keep my books and vases. I was trying to put all furniture on right places. Now my living room looks optional and sufficient.
