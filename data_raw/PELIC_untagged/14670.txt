I have had two jobs in a pc room and in the T. G. I Friday. These have several similarities and differences. These two jobs are similar jobs. First of all both jobs are part time jobs. Also both of these jobs have uniforms. In addition they require the same conditions age sincerity and so on. Another similarity between the two jobs is attitude for a customer. The pc room job needs a good attitude and so does the T. G. I Friday job. Finally both jobs are not sedentary. In addition to several similarities these two jobs have several differences. First the T. G. I Friday job's environment is cleaner than the pc room job's. Although the pc room job gets a litte money the T. G. I Friday job gets lots of money. Also the T. G. I Friday job is more active than the pc room job. Unlike the pc room job the T. G. I Friday job is nice. Because I can eat many kinds of food!
