It's said that children inherently have advantageous and weak individual's personality such as open gregarious sociable and lonely eccentric unsociable etc. I don't know how much individual's personalities are inherent but I believe that birth order affect an individual's personality. In a family the first born child is more responsible and become emotionally mature quickly that the second born child or the later born children. When parents have one more children they will be getting busy and hope the first one to take care on her his younger sibling. While the first one responds to the sibling he she generates a kind of responsibility and become supportive and reliable. Also parents encourage the first one to be a model of his her younger sibling in which case she he might behave with restriction and seriousness. The very persuasive fact is that the 1st children and the only children are both the first born children however we cannot draw a parallel between the two. The families that have only children may regard the only one as a crucial person whom whole family members pay intense attention on. In this environment the only children grow up to become self centered adults who may not have the same individual's personalities as the one who has sibling. So birth order can affect an individual's personality.
