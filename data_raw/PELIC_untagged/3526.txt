In my city there different things have been changed. For example the infrastructures have been old since 1982. Now they've been developed and enhanced. Also the house design has depended on the traditional shapes. But now the houses and building have been built with different styles and shapes. By the way my city has been international airport for more than 30 years. But now it's been developed to become the big one in the region. Finally I love my city which I've lived there all my life before I've studied here.
