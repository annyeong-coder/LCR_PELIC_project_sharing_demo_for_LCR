I'll descrip my childhood bedroom . My childhood bedroom whose walls are blue an it was small room which I shared with my cousin because we lived in small apartment . There was one bed which I slept on it and my cousin slept on the floor . Also behind my bed was a window where I can saw the soccer field . My cousin is someone who studies medicine in Poland . I love my childhood bedroom where I spent a lot of time in . I hate the day when we left that apartment . Now my cousin is someone whom I respect .
