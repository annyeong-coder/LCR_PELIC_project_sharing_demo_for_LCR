hi everybody. I am writing note to intruduce my self to you my classmates in English 047. Our teacher wants a profile from each of us. At first I was confused by this assignment because my English dictionary defines profile as a side view of somene s head every day! Then I saw the next definition a short description of a person's life and character. OK then. Here is my profile My name is Student's Name Some of my friend call me Pay Ha because that is how my initials sound in German. I am studying English here in Miami because I want to attend gradate school in Colorado or Montreal. Maybe you are asking yourself Why goes he wants to leave Miami to go to these places The answer is snow! I come from Austria so I love to ski. N fact my nickname in my family is Blitz lightning because I am always trying to improve my speed.
