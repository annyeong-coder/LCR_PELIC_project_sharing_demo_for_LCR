There are many kinds of language in our earth but not every language was used by many people. Linguists think nearly half of the world's current stock of languages may disappear and more than 1000 languages are disappearing because they aren't widespread. Even some parents in villages often encourage their children to move away from the insular language. But each language has different usage or significance and maybe different language including the traditions and legends of different areas or including the laws of nature. Everything in our world keeps our environment going if a language disappear might affect the operation of life. It's a big issue. We should protect and respect them. One way to protect different language is enshrine it in writing and another way is compile a dictionary but a lot of language just have pronounce without word. It's really hard to continue so this is not only linguists' business it's our job. We should realize the important of this problem and solve it by all the people in this world.
