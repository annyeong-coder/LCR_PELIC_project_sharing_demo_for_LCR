A lot of feeling come up while I read this essay such as loyalty love and patient. When someone has a dog and get long with it and when they both get sick you try to take care of it here is the fitful. While you are alone and you treat your friend's children as they your children. I remember when my father told me about his dog it seems similar for the essay that my father had a farm a long time ago and his dog was with him every time he want to farm. One day the dog got sick and died while there was no vet around his area. My father felt sad he did not tell my brothers and told them someone bought the dog.
