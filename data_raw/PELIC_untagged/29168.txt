Driving age should be raised Some opposite argument said that will denies young people access to safe transportation and the accidents just be delayed by one year. However a 16 year old teenager can drive does that law really make sense In my opinion a 16 year old teenager is not mature enough to make driving decision they are not mature enough to handle being behind the wheel of a car. Car crashes are the leading cause of death among teenagers. Many experts support this idea. ANON_NAME_0 n. D. Said that Immaturity and Inexperience both contribute to crashes. It is hard to untangle the two. Fleming n. D. Said raising the age from 16 to 17 saves lives in crashes. As a result I do not think a 16 year old teenager have qualification to drive a car. Compare with other countries minimum driving age's law and successful New Jersey's license law. The minimum driving age in the United States should be changed and raised.
