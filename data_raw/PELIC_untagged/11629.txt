Hello Mr. ANON_NAME_0 This is ANON_NAME_1 Ye. I am a student in ANON_NAME_2's writing class. I want to thank you for your wonderful lecture about how to use the library system to search information at last Friday. I learned a lot of things from it and it will definitely make my study in the future easier. I really appreciate your help. Best wishes to you. Yours ANON_NAME_1 Last Name
