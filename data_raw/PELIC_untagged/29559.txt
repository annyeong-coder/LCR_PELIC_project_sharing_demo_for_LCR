My favorite food is Pasta with tomato sauce. When I cook it I bring two bags of Pasta and a bottle of tomato sauce. I put the Pasta in the pot and put tow tablesponese of salt. After ten minutes I take the Pasta out of the pot. I mix the Pasta with three tablespones of tomato sauce. Then I enjoy and eat it.
