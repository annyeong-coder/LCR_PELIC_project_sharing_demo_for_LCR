While I was goint to school I saw my friend fighting to someone. When I came the room he was listening to music. While I was watching tv he was bleeding. When I was driving car it was raining . When I went to wedding day I saw they were dancing. When I came the classroom my classmates were doing their homework. While I was eating something at the garden I saw he was driving a car 50 miles hour.
