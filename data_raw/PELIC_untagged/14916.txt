I'm going to write some notes to identify and introduce myself to classmate. First I'm ANON_NAME_0. I'm 41 years old. I'm studying English language in the ELI school. I'm married. I have 3 children. I go to school by bus. I'm always trying to improve my language. I'm trying to get admission to continue my study but they need high score in TOEFL test even thought I had no previous experience. My favorite hobby is soccer and swimming. I'm cooperating with my friend to rent apartment in Oakland because it's close to school.
