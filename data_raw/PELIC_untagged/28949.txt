There are a lot of differences between food in Taiwan and food in the United States. Food in Taiwan is healthier than food in the United States. We don't eat much fast food. The food in Taiwan is not as expensive as the food in the United States. It only costs 3 dollars to have a meal in Taiwan. It is easier to eat fresh seafood in Taiwan than in the United States. Because Taiwan is a small island the catch is huge.
