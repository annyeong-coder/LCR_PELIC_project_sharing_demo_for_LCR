Writing 4P 31 Jan 07 The Problem and Solution of Having Relationships with People Having relationships with people often has a lot of problems. Each person has different personalities diverse ideas and thoughts. It's natural to get some troubles in relationships. But what is the most main reason that makes people have problems And how can they settle it People usually tend to forget what they do wrong and to remember what other people do wrong especially when it hurts them. When something bad happens between people they have an argument and both of them keep saying it is the other's fault arranging one by one. They only have self assertion and insist on it and after all it doesn't work it out. After the argument they don't feel good and get hurts from other's words. If this situation goes on it will be really hard to recover the relationship between them. Although they don't intend to be like that it's easy to turn it into the worst situation. To get a solution about that is that first they should know what the main problem is and what each of them didn't do right. Before blaming other people they have to know their's fault and then look at the problem from other's point of view. Through this way they can know what they miss on each own side. It makes think them more reasonably to sort the problem out and leads to understanding each other and admitting the faults each of them has. So it's easy to work the problems out and everything goes on fine. The Relationship is an important thing for people in their lives and it doesn't always do what they want. However if they place themselves in each other's place and respect each other troubles in the relationship will decrease and it will be easier to have relationships with people.
