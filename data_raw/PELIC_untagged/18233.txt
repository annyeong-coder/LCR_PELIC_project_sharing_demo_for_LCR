There are five people in my family. My mother is as kind as my father. They often help poor people. My sister and brother are both younger than me. My brother is the youngest child. My brother is more intelligent than me because he has the highest degree in my family. I like traveling and my sister do too. We have ever been to Europe for one month. Hope I can visit there again.
