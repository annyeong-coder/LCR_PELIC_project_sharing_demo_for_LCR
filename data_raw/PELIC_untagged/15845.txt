Yesterday the phone rang while I was sleeping. I woke and picked up the phone. On the other end was my friend ANON_NAME_0. He wanted me to sign up for evening classes. At first I turned down this idea because I leave the ELI' classes late and I need some rest. While I was talking with him the door was knocked. I asked him to hold on for seconds and I went to open the door. What a surprise! It was my brother who lives in California. After that I returned back to the call and we kept on talking. We kept going back and forth until he finally talked me into evening classes. Then I told him that my brother just arrived and I had to hang up and I would call him back on the next day morning.
