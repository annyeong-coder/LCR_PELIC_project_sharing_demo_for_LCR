When I was single I used to wake up early around 5 . Also I used to eat my beakfaste with my family . After that I used to begin my first class at 7am and came to my home family at 1 am . Then I used to eat lunch with my family . In after noon I used to write my home work . Finally I was sleeping a lot and I did not use have many responsebility . In my home family we had homemaker to most the woke so I did not use clean or cook . Now my life has big different now I am married I have husband and son to care of them . Usually I wake up at 6 am and I back from school at 4pm. I have many thing to do every day. I feed my son I cook I clean . Also I study every day . Finally I have big changes in my life before and that made me stronger .
