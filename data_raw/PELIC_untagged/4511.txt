I met my teacher a GRE teacher when he was teaching a GRE class. We were not real friends because we did not have any friends' conversation. Even though the relationship was not so close he still enlightened me not only to study English but also encourage me to persist in pursuing my dream. He also taught me how to make my thought more rational. This kind of skill can help me organize my thoughts into a reasonable and clearer way. I appreciated learning not only English but also other valuable knowledge from him.
