Acquaintance is a person who I know but in a casual way is someone who I do not know anything of he or she life. This kind of relationship is not as close as a friendship. For me a friend is a person who I hang out with is somebody who I share some moments but this relationship is not as intimate as a best friend. A best friend is a person who listens and shares all feelings and moments in my life. I enjoy all these kinds of relationships but I prefer the relationship that exists betwee best friends. A best friend is a person who I can count anytime it does not matter if there are good or bad times.
