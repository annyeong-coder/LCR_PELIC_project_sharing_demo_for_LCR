I saw a movie whose name is Meet Joe Black starring Brad Pitt Anthony Hopkins and Claire Forlani. It is a excellent story about love. Bill Parrish a successful businessman was going to take his 65th birthday. However his health condition which made him feel bad suggested him the death was coming. Then the Death using a young man's body who was falling in love with bill's beautiful daughter ANON_NAME_0 in a coffee shop in the early morning really came to his life. The Death wanted to observe the human's life most of which made him happy in the following days from Bill's angle let Bill named him Joe Black. ANON_NAME_0 didn't know he was no more the young man whom she met in the morning still loved him and finally the Death fallen in love with ANON_NAME_0 too. Did the Death take ANON_NAME_0 to the death world which she's not belonging to with him Or Did he return the young man's life whom ANON_NAME_0 met You should find the answer by your self.
