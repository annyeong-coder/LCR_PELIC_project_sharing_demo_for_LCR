I still think guard line is important for consumer. If they have 5 they spend 5 even spend 6 this is a bad habit. They don't care the financial deficit they believe they can got out of debt but finally they get out of hand and have to file for bankruptcy. 1. In my opinion the Pandit family can reduce their expenses in the following items clothing food electricity gas vacation entertainment furniture and appliances charity donations and others. Clothing future and appliances are reliable consumable they needn't be updated. Vacation isn't pre requisite but some entertainment is needful. In addition I know that it's possible that it is 2 000 for electricity and gas. 2. Ray drove a Lexus the car value is 28 000 and he could pay the bills in 4 years not in two years. If he couldn't do it he can sell it and buy another cheaper one. I think Ray or Maribel should do some simple repair or ask their friends to do them. If they always ask experts to repair it will spend a lot of money. 3. If Ritu will be successful in skating she will make a lot of money. However if she end her career before it starts they will lost a great deal of money and she have to go to college. So I think they should find a company and cooperate with them. The company supports her and takes in hand her risk for fail in skating. If she becomes a professional ice skater she can make ads free for the company. 4. The following form can explain that their financial future is good. Ray earns 95 000 a year so they can save a lot of money. 5. I think medical insurance is very important so they should buy it and 3 600 is enough a year other 1 000 is for co pay. In addition Ray should buy life insurance. They should save a great deal of money for their children for education.
