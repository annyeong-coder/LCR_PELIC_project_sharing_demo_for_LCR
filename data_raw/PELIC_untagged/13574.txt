Previous Me and Present Me Going abroad for me is a big challenge. I have been United States for one month. In the totally different place everything can change me a lot. I want to show what changes happened to me it's necessary for me to improve myself and to summarize the first month that I have been through. There are some similarities and differences between the previous me and present me such as ambition living ability and attitude. No matter in China or in United States I always have ambition. I believe that talent is not born in accident. Appropriate environment right education can make a person become talented and confident. And there is another thing that I have never changed is that I always be optimistic. In my opinion if I work hard I can overcome any difficulties. So I think my life is filled with opportunities and hopes. Compared with similarities differences are in more aspects. Firstly after the one month I learn more about living abilities. In China everything depends on my parents. Even just housework is done by my mother. But now I do everything by myself. Secondly I have eatten my mum's cooking for more than ten years so I bored with that. On the contrast I miss the flavor of my mum's cooking so much now. In addition in former I was always impatient to talk with my mother. Sometimes maybe make her upset. But now I become sensible and mature. When I was making a phone call with my mum she said I was growing up and she was very proud of me. At last I used to be very lazy and never did exercises. Now I go to the gym everyday when my classes are over. It's in order to form a better life habit that can make myself heathier so my parents needn't worry about me. To conclude there are some similarities and differences between the previous me and present me. The positive things that in my mind have never changed but I do abandon some shortcomings during the first month. In the future I will become better and achieve my goal.
