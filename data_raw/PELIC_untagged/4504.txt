The Memorial Day Every year on the last Monday of May most Americans remember their soldiers who died in the wars that happen among the United States. They are going out side their houses and take a flag. Some of them may go to the cemetery and takes a flag and put them near to the soldier's graves. It's a day off for everybody and the government called it The Memorial Day . Actually it's the first time for me to attend this day here in the United States and it's the first time to know what it is about from my teacher too. I don't have enough information about it yet but I have write about what I just have know from my teacher.
