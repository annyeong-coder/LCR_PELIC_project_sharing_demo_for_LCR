I obtained a pysical therapy's license in 2006. By 2004 I had already learned about a lot of physical therapy's courses in the university. I had been trying to remember many things before I took a state examination. So I had prepared a state examination for a year. It was long time for me but I had already finished a preparation. I had been worrying about the result. But eventually I could recieve the license.
