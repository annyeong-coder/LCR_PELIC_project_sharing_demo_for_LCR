I became an engineer in 2011. Since then I have taught Manufacturing System Design. I have been teaching assistant for 1 year. I have been here I the United States of America for 2 months. I have loved engineering since I was in high school. I have not been absent since I started this semester. Since I was 13 years old I have been acting as an adult. I have loved Pittsburgh since I was here. I have not played golf for whole my life. I've liked Mexican food since I tried it last month.
