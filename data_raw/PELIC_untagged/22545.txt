From my point of view the ideal parent is the parent who concerns about their children in diverse things. Father and mother both of them implant the personality in their children. The parent has the responsibility including educates their children advise them to the right way and to be very closely to them in particular at adolescence age. In addition ideal parent encouraging their children in participating in many activities is extremely crucial. Child rising which is the most important stage is by distinguishing the differences between right and wrong and educates the children to respect the others. Also the punishment is necessary in raising the kids when children are doing a crime but the ideal parent whom I prefer is the parent who chooses the discipline which fit with the crime. The ideal parent is the parent who understands their kids and attempts to clarify for them every thing about the challenging that may confront in their future. It is often that the children have a great many questions which is not important in the early stage of raising. However the ideal parent is the parent who knows the obstacles of their kids and tries to answer them in rational methods. Finally the ideal parent is the parent who takes the benefit and the advantage of the lives' chance that contribute to success for their kids. Finally the success in the live which all parents hope that for their children contributes to the parents' patient in raising their children.
