When I lived in Korea I lived with my parents. Actually I didn't live my house because I had to live in boarding house where I studied in university. When I entered in military service I had to live in BOQ that is bachelor officers' quarters since I graduated university. However although I hadn't lived in my house a lot of time my most comfortable place is my house. If you visit to my house you can find that my room is so clean because I didn't live in my room a lot of time. Anyway if I invite you to my room first of all you can find double bed where I slept in the center and there is a big chest on the wall and desk near the chest. On the desk there is some collection book whose stamps I collect. It's very special for me. Also I have small storage out of the room. I put the book in which I used to read before. Sometime I remember that I drunk a beer in my room.
