Hi I have been designing my lovely website for more than nine months. I am glad to say that it's been an honor to me to share with you my life interests. I was born in Kuwait on oct. 5 1992. I grew up in a lovely house surrounded by my lovely family and friends. The most interests that I have been practicing playing soccer for the upcoming tournament that will be held at the University of Kansas City Missouri. I have been dreaming to be Mechanical Engineer since I have moved to study in the U. S. Living in the U. S is very difficult because you are far away from your family and your best friends. In the U. S it's easy to make friends everybody is smiling open minded and easy going. So I enjoy my staying in the U. S and consider it as an adventure you can comment to the pictures that I had just uploaded.
