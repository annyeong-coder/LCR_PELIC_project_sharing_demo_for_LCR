I will live to Durham this August and I don't want to study English in Durham. I must study hard in Pittsburgh. I've live in Pittsburgh for 2 years so I could have studied hard. I should have praticed English any place but I've spoken Korean more than English. If I made a good plan to study English I might have taken a CPA test for my job. I know that I don't have to take the CPA test for my job. However if I pass the test I will be able to find a job in my country. I can't swim because I am always afaid of water. I must have had some bad experience about swimming.
