Topic a mysterious place you have visited Two years ago I visited a misterious place in Chine. That is the Great Wall. The Great Wall is one of the famous mistery in the world. When I was looking at the Great Wall I was surprised because it is bigger than my expectation. This is magificent beyond discription. I was wonder how can move the big stone to the top of the moutain without high tech equipment how can carve the stone into the quadrangled stone. I think the greet Wall is very sophisicated that is why it is possible to keep the shape for a long time in spite of a lot of disasteres.
