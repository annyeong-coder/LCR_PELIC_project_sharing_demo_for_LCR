Welcome! I am ANON_NAME_0 Last Name . I built this website to let you know about my experience in the US. I have been in Pittsburgh PA since Nov 15 2009. I stayed in Chicago for four days when I first arrived to the US and then I came to Pittsburgh. I have put many useful links below if you wish to know more about my journey to the US or my life back in my country. I came to the US to study for my PhD. My study is connected with English the language that I have always liked. I have been learning English since I was a high school student. I have learned a lot since I came to the US. I heard that the ELI is a very good place to learn English. I have been learning very useful things since I joined the ELI. I have had many good friends in Pittsburgh so far. However I haven't been seeing them so often because I have been so busy recently. I have been doing some interesting sports since I came to Pittsburgh. Those are like soccer and skiing. I have included some pictures that I have taken recently. Remember to follow the link below to see them. They can tell you more about me.
