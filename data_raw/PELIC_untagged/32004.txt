On November 10 2011 I created a time capsule. I created a time capsule as a box. I put in my locker desk in my room. The capsule contains 5 items. I put three pictures for me when I was 5 old years. I collected all the gifts from my mother in the box. I put some money and also the old money used to buy for 50 years ago. I collected my favorite books and I put its. I took the letters to my parents and I put in the box.
