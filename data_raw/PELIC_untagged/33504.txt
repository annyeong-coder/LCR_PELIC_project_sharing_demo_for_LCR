One thing on my mind is exercise. I've been gaining weight since I came here so I have to have a time to exercise at least twice a week. Fortunately I found a badminton club for citizens here so I'm going to join them. Another on my mind is English. I only have 7 months left to stay in the U. S. Therefore I'm a bit upset. I need more chances to improve my English so today I visited a Toastmasters Club which gives chances of public speaking in Oakland. Because an atmosphere there was so friendly and warm I'd like to join them also. The other is USMLE which is a national board for doctors in the U. S. It is composed od 3 steps and I'm going to take the first step in this year. It means I have to start preparing now! These are 3 biggest things of what are on my mind. . .
