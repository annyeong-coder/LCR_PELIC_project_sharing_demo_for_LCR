If you live belong the human sociaty you've probably met a lot of people such as friends family and co worker. You comunicate with them and you can be orgnization. So did you think about talking How about the truth Is it necessary to go to your relatinship I think of coures yes but not at all. There are some reason to support my answer. First of all if you are very sick or you have to do something that is the higiest secrit can you ask them to your family I don't think so. Sometimes you shouldn't say your private things to your family. It's better than you tell them. Second we think about co worker. If you have a job you always have a secreit to co worker because co worker is someone who kind of copetition you should win. However sometime there is an exception. With friends the truth is very important with friends. You always tread to friends as credit and don't say lay. In the life you've been meeting so many people. Some people are bad and another people are very kind and nice like angel. If you could compare the people which person is good or bad you know that you should say lay to people which moment you should say lay or truth. It might very important in any relarionship. On count of untruth you can continue better relationship with people.
