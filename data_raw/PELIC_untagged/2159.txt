Writing4M 1 29 07 I want to talk about a successful friend that how he opens his own on line clothes store. My friend is 24 years old just older than me about 2 years. He very like to do everything is new. One time he bought some clothes on e bay and compared the price between Taiwan and Japan. Then he found the clothes in Japan are cheaper than Taiwan so he had a new idea. He wanted to open a store on e bay. He was very lucky because he has cousin in Japan so he went to Japan to find some brand of clothes that most Taiwan teenagers like. Finally he found some stores very quickly so he bought some clothes and put on e bay to start his own store. He was very happy because the store became popular a lot of people bought his clothes on his store. So he bought more things and put on e bay. Now he can make a lot of money by himself. I think he is very successful because he makes it.
