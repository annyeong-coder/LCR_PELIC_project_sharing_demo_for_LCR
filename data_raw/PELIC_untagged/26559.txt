Acquiring English is difficult obviously. First it is relevant to my language of Japanese because Japanese has a different structure of sentence. Second another my problem is pronunciation so correcting it is my second target. Finally my initial problem of learning English was my character because I m a little bit shy. It is still annoy and confusing me so I have to try to change my fault.
