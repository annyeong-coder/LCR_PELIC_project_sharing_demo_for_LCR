Limiting students' time on line might help Webaholism people to decrease of using computer. Before I came to the U. S. I studied in industrial college and it gives every student limits time on line because they know kind of opening limit is Webaholism. So the administration of that college decided to put limiting time for following reasons. Firs of all. It takes student's time so they want to let student look over his books not all the time on computer for instance someone lives on campus and he or she is Webaholism and there is limiting time for students in my opinion he will take a long time on that and there is no looking over books. Secondly it is kind if sickness as I mentioned in the first of my paragraph e. G. It hurts his or her physical body like his eyes and it is going to make him lazy and like this physical damages. In closing I would like to say that I hope all schools put limiting time to let those people stop of using this in negative way.
