I think human language and nonhuman primate language are different as like human's tool using and nonhuman's tool using. In an aspect of using tools primates have used simple tools such as using twig or making a nut cracker but they still use those things without development. However human have developed tools with technology. They have invented innovative tools like telephones airplanes bulbs and computers. According to the Koko video Koko is well trained and she can understand more than 1 000 sign language and 2 000 spoken English words. Even though Koko's language is an incredibly amazing aspect of nonhuman primate behavior nonhuman primate language is still much simpler than human language. People use much more than 100 000 words make complete sentences with grammar and make sentences more sophisticated to convey its meaning more precisely or express literary beauty. Also Koko is famous for its rarity which means not all of nonhuman primates can understand sign language or spoken English. Therefore nonhuman primate language is different from human language.
