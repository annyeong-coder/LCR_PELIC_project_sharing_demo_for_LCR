I am going to write down about my experience I have had on the phone. In Japan telemarketers used to call me. I never failed to turn down their offers. I asked them to take my name off their calling list. Once they agreeded about it but they called again. So I decided not to pick up the phone if it is probably a telemarketer's call. But I often ended up missing important calls.
