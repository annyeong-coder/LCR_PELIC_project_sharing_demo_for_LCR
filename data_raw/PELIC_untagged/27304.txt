In the world today there are many important environmental issues. In my opinion the most serious problem is related to the rights of animals. Some activists try to persuade people to change their actituds in relation to animals. I think that this is a great way to start to figure out the way in wich animals are like human beings. That is to say also animals have rights that everybody should protect because animals whatever their species are an essential part of the planet. There are many organizations in the world that seek to legislate some reglations to guarantee a good life for all animals. Also some artists and scholars around the world suggest alternative ways to defend the rights of animals. So a lot of people are interested in stimulating a change of mentality about animals that is to say they seek respect for all species that life on the green planet. This is a wonderful iniciative that all of us should support because not only human beings are living in the world. Animals are marvelous beings that should be protected and treated with dignity.
