Since I arrived to Pittsburgh I have been knowing many places that I have never been there before. I have been in Hidden Valley and Somerset for a weekend and I have been doing tubing there and also I have taken ski classes there. I have been at Hersheys and Lancaster County for a weekend. I have doing exercise at home everyday. I have gone to the Steelers stadium for the last game when they won the championship of this area. I have been going to church every sunday. I have eaten many food that I have never tryed before. I have been meeting many people from many and different cultures.
