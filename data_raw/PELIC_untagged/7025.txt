I have a friend whose name is john. John who lives in Taiwan came to visit me this week. He is a person that likes to play basketball. His basketball skills are so good that let him into a school team. We met each other because I like to meet someone who plays basketball well. My basketball skills are also good that let me join the school team too. I remembered one of his friends whose home has a basketball court. So I practice with my friend every time when we went to his friend's home.
