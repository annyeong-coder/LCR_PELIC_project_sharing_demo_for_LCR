I am thinking about my daughter Yara. Last night I hadn't got much of sleep because she has a fever and I am hoping she is better now. In addition the homework for tomorrow seems to be a lot and I am worried about doing them in time. I also think about my family I have been away from them for six months now and it feels like a year. I would like to see them after this semester and spend the Eid with them. However I cannot decide this now not until I receive the responses from the universities' admission. So every day for the last six months most of my mind is thinking about getting a PhD offer in the USA. I applied for a lot of universities and I still did not get responses from all of them. Therefore whenever my phone beep for receiving a new e mail I quickly check it hoping to read an e mail that make my day actually my entire year. However it is dinner time and I am starting to get hungry. So the thought of having two slices of pizza with a glass of ice tea is becoming very delicious right now.
