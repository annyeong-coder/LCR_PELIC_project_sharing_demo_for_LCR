Before going to colllege I had to figure out what I want to study. Believing primary power behind the scene of the world is money I decided to become a business person however while studying business I soon realized that whether or not people make a successful career in business all depends on how well they communicate with others. Since then the pursuit of my academic careeir has changed into rhetoric the art of persuasive speaking. On graduating from college I got married and came to the United States with my husband who had been already studying in Virginia Tech. Had I not gotten married I would have given up to study rhetoric instead I would be working in a company or still studying business in a graduate school because there are not many schools having a good rhetoric programin Korea. Fortunately however I am here in the United States now which gives me an opportunity to be able to do what I really want to do. Having applied for a several graduate school I am waiting for good news from Pitt or CMU. Hope that I would belong to one of the programs around this time next year.
