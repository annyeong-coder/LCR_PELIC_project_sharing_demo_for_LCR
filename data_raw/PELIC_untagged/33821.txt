My mother My mother has been an arts teacher since 1997. She has taught in elementary school. She has received many awards. The Ministry of Education has honored his since she began in teaching. She has done a lot of works of art in school. She has taught people a lot of kinds of art in our house for free for a long time. She has learned sewing since she was young. She can sew a dress for a short time. She is a human ambition and love to always give. I hope to become like my mother.
