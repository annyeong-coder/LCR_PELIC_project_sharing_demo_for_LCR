When I was in high school I met to Agustin. He is my best friend in Mexico. I met him when I was playing soccer with my friends in the school. He didn't know to play very well but he learned fast. Because we were in the same classroom we did some homeworks together. The next month he will move to Toronto so I will visit he soon.
