1 Cover up I believe we must cover up the walls with wallpapers. 2 Light up I think we have to lighten the class up with more lights. 3 Put away I think we should put the projector away to a different place. 4 Touch up I think we must touch the chairs up with some color. 5 Hang up I believe it will be better if we hang up some pictures on the wall. 6 Move around I think we should move the board around to the other side.
