Before you read this paragraph please make sure you are not just finishing your meal. Thank you. The worst meal experience I've ever had had happened when I was in high shcool. I could remember that there were many small restaurants around my school and I would like to have lunch in them one by one every week. One day I came into a newly opened one I ordered a rice bowl. I was pretty hungre at that time and I really expected their food. A few minutes later my order came in front of me. It really grabed my apetite. Some green vegetable with fresh beef lied on it. I kept swallowing but when I almost finished. There was a cockroach appeared in the bottom. It was like one inch size and I couldn't help vomitting up and called the boss with extreme anger. He soon came to my table and looked into my bowl. He looked very nervous and he entreated me not exposing this thing to other customer or calling authority for compliant. He paid 500 rmb chinese money roughly about 70 for apologize. Finally I decided to forgive him for this time.
