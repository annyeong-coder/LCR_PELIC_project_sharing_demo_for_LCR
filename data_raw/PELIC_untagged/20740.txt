Two years ago a friend of mine arbitrarily decided to establish his own construction company. He didn't have enough knowledge about this kind of business. He had a bad time then he decided to close his company. George W Bush made a lot of arbitrary decisions when he was in power. Such as sending American soldiers to the war in Iraq.
