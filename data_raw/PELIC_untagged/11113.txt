In Pittsburgh I always eat breakfast in the morning but I never ate breakfast in my country. In Pittsburgh I always take buses but in my country I usually walked or drove a car. Here I usually go to the gym but in my country I never went to the gym. In my country every Sunday me and my friends met in a pub but here I can't go to pubs. In my country I had a lot of free time but here I don't have enough free time. In my country I usually slept late in the morning but here I get up early.
