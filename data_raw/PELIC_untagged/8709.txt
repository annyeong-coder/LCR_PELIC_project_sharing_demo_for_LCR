In the 19th century many people immigrated from different countries to America. In the early 19th century there were few immigrants in America and almost 50 percent of all immigrants were Irish. This percent was kept up until the middle of 19th century. But the number of immigrants rose suddenly from 1830 to 1859. Especially the percents of German and British immigrants had a remarkable increase. After that the immigrants of other counties continued increasing even though there was a slight decrease from 1860 to 1879 on the whole. The most notable there was a drastic increase again from 1880 to 1890 so the number of all immigrants was more than 500 000 and had doubled in those ten years. In the end of 19th century this number dropped slightly but it was far more than that in the early 19th century. Today a lot of people are still continuing to immigrate to America.
