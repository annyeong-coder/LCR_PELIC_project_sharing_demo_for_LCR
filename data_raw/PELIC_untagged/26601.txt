In the first years of education child start to elaborate what he or she wont to do without limitation and restriction either to time or to things he wont to do it . For example no specific time for playing and studying that will give the child advantage to contact with other and think about things around him or her . That could lead the child to go to what the author named it flow. On the other hand the fourth grade child can be hindered by roles because the teacher and his parents start to think that he or she now should have responsibility towered other and himself. Without knowing the chemistry of your child you will deprive his or her desire to complete his creativity. I agree that over control the child could inhibit his desire to learn more. For example some people treat their child as if he adult or mature based on what he or she think that this is the time to have some responsibilities. That ignore the fact that child need more time and diverse source of savor.
