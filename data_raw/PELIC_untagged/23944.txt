All of us have friend but not all our friends could be our buddies. A friend can have different explanations. A friend could be a person who you know. In some ideas a friend could be a person who support you. For me a friend is a person that share his her experience with me. One thing I want to emphasize is a person that tell lies can not be my friend. Do you know what is a buddy A native speaker told me that a buddy is a close friend who accompanies his buddies in their activities. I have a close friend whose name is Abby is my buddy. Also Abby is my buddy whose secret is open to me.
