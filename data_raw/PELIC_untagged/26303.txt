A picture that displays the emotions can bring forth emotions from a viewer. This picture in particle depicts two mature ladies expressing sorrow. There are many reasons why someone may express feelings of sadness. Watching someone expressed sadness may cause reactions from others. The reactions of sadness and pain hopelessness and concern are very common feeling that one may expressed when looking at a side person. First looking at the picture made me feel sadness and pain. It made me think of a funeral and the all the sad people that would attend. It also reminds me of a friend who lost his father. Death causes people to react differently. The picture shows one lady comforting the other. Sometimes a death requires support from someone else and looking at this picture made me feel to comfort these people. Second looking at the picture made me feel hopeless. I felt hopeless because I am unable to help them. The picture made me think that they were expressing sadness because one of them may have a terminal disease. Finding out that you have a disease that does not have a cure may leave a person feeling as if it is the end of the world. For example the person in the picture may have found out that she has cancer all over the body and the doctors are unable to help her. Thinking about this situation made me think that sometimes life may not be fair. Finally looking at the picture made me feel concern for them. I felt concerned because I did not know the reason for their sadness. Seeing someone sad or crying always makes you think of what might be wrong with that person. It reminded of the time when I felt concerned because I lost my pet and I didn't know the whereabouts. In conclusion this picture produces three different reactions from me. It made feel pain and sadness hopelessness and finally it made me feel concerned. This picture was capable of creating different reaction from me and I believe that it would do the same for other people who may look at it also.
