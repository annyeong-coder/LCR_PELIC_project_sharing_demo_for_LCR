From my perspective a soul mate must be a person who have the similar background. So he can understand the your feelings which may others can not understand. At the same time a soul mate must be your friend who is willing to help you when you are in trouble. Also a soul mate should have some same interests as you which can make me and he more close and having more things to discuss. Last but not least a soul mate must be a optimistic guy which can influence you to have a more positive attitude to your life.
