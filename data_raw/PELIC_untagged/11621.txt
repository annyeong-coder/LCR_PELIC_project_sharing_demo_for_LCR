My life was greatly changed after marriage. Because of marriage I quit my job I left my family and country I postponed taking the qualifying examination of teacher and I am with my husband now. Sometimes I imagine what would have happened if I hadn't gotten married. For me my mother who recently took a surgery for her knees is the strongest reason to make me want to return to Korea. If only I had taken care of her. If I hadn't gotten married and hadn't come to the U. S. I would be in Korea now with my mother and take care of her. On the other hand if I were in Korea now I would be studying for the qualifying examination of teacher which is very competitive and stressful. This imagination makes me very nervous because I should take the exam someday. I wish I could be a good teacher. Anyway I know that this kind of imagination is useless because my decision was already done and cannot be changed. Moreover I believe that my decision marriage is the best choice of my life.
