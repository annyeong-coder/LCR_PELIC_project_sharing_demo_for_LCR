Real Friends Many people describe friends as the people who have the same hobbies interests and who like the same activities such as sports and games. I think that these factors can make a relationship closely and friendly however I don't think that this is the real meaning of a friend. I have a friend who is living in Chicago now. We met each other when we were only 8 years old. When I was in elementary school's classroom I saw him first. Surprisingly we were living in the same apartment building. This is one reason that we became good friends. He was my first Korean friend whose name is John Moon. We attended the same elementary middle and high school which is close to our house. We understood and supported each other when we have not only problems or matters but also ordinary conversation. Unfortunately John who is my soul mate moved to Chicago when we were 17 years old. I was so sad however it wasn't a big problem because we knew that even distance can't interrupt our friendship. He goes to Korea every vacation also when I joined military service for two years he went to Korea to meet me. I can perceive what's happening to him or what he wants without saying any words only eye contact although we couldn't meet each other for a long time. A meaning of a friend could be a person who shares their feelings a person who enjoys their daily life together. However the real friend's meaning I think is My life . Sometimes we can count on each other sometimes we have to be the first person who makes him her to do the right thing because it's also my life. Between the real friends the one thing that they need is not saying or doing it's existing besides each other.
