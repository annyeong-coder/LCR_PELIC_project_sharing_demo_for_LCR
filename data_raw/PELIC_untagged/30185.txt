Cohabitation usually refers to an arrangement whereby two people decide to live together on a long term or permanent basis in an emotionally and or sexually intimate relationship. Couples who lived together before marriage also separated more often and regarded marriage as a less important part of their life than those who did not live together before marriage. Those living together before marriage have more frequent disagreements more fights and violence more negative and less positive when resolving a marital problem and when providing support to their partner and also were more verbally aggressive less supportive of one another and generally more hostile than spouses who had not lived together. Couples who had cohabited prior to marriage reported greater marital conflict and poorer communication than married couples who had never cohabited. Living together outside of marriage negatively impacts their children. In conclusion we can say living together does not produce healthier happier marriages but on the other hand mature love is built on the security of knowing that your love is exclusive and permanent.
