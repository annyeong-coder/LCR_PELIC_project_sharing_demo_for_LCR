When I moved in Pittsburgh I had been picking up two kinds of the phone that were embarrassing to me. One was a wrong number phone and the other was a telemarketer phone. The first time when I picked up the telemarketer phone. She said This is very important thing to you but I couldn't figure out what it was. So I held on the phone for a while. Finally I could find it out what it was. I turned her proposal down and hung up the phone. But the telemarketer went on calling me and she tried to talk me into buying a car. After all I told her I would think it over and asked her to call me back later. After that I didn't keep on receiving an unknown call.
