I met my friend sueyoen while I was reading a textbook in a class. She moved in my town when I was 13 yrs old. When Cristmas came she made fancy cards for many friends and I got one. Someday the whole class were singing a new song there were just two students who did not know the song. They were us because the song was for adults. After graduating an elementary school we met in a highschool and became best friends.
