I met my friend fawns while I was living in Kuwait. I met him a year ago at the University Of Kuwait. When I met him he became my best friend. We went everywhere together. We studied for classes and our homework. I lived in the same place with him while I was in the United States. When I was at his apartment I played chess with him. We did our assignments while I was attending the University of Pittsburgh. We had our meals together when we had breaks from classes. We played soccer together with our team in school. While I was playing soccer I injured my leg. He took me to the hospital and stayed all the time with me. When I was in the hospital he told my parents about the details. He is a good friend.
