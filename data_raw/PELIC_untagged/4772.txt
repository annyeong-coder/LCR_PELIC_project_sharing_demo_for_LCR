I met my best friend when he was working in police department . When I went to there to paid my ticket. In fact he was writing report to people who didn't make payment. Meanwhile I was looking for my ID. Then I talked with him about how can I paid the ticket he answered and he helped me how can I paid it. Then when I finished paid the ticket I came to him to took his phone number if I need anything in the future. After that I came back to my house. Fater 2 months I had B day and I called him to attended my B day. Since those days until now he is my best friend.
