Traveling is a lesson in my life. Before trips I am aware that I will travel in the future therefore I can find out not only how to arrange my time but also how to save my money. For example I should finish all my assignment before having a trip. In addition I can eat in my home instead of having a meal in a restaurant to reduce a consumption of food. During trips without working or studying pressure I can relax completely by wandering a new city without using my brain so that I have vitality when I go back to my job. Moreover my body and mind can be refreshed by obtaining new experiences form the city which I visit. It makes me healthier. After trips different experiences open my eyes and motivate me to create a novel way of thinking. To illustrate I learn different thinking by talking and getting along with different people. Traveling teaches me a lot.
