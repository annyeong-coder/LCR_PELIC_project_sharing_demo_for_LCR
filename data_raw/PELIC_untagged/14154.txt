My most exciting thing is the Imagine Pittsburgh Fireworks. I put it on the place where it seemed to see fireworks well by the friend. I climbed on the hill in which it looked down at Downtown and I saw many fireworks. Fireworks continued for about 30 minutes and I saw several thousand fireworks. I was very excited. The fireworks were launched from a lot of places such as boats that float on the river many skyscrapers and the bridge in Downtown. Also the fireworks were projected onto the surface of the water and it was beautiful.
