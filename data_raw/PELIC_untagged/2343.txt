In the past several years we have become much more aware of hazardous conditions in the environment. Scientists for instance recently reported that ozone the natural shield protecting us from the sun's ultraviolet rays has declined significantly. They noted that a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica has developed and blamed the widespread use of certain chemicals for the ozone decrease. Moreover scientists have warned us about the greenhous effect the gradual warming of the earth because the heat from the sun's rays is prevented from radiating back into space by a blanket of artificial gases. Especially the chief gas in the greenhouse effect is carbon dioxide a byproduct of burning fossil fuels in cars and factories. Also waste diposal has become a significant problem. We not only have tons and tons of household garbage to get rid of but we also have hazardous waste from nuclear facilities and plants. In conclusion while all of these are significant problems that must be solved in the near future at least we are now more aware of them.
