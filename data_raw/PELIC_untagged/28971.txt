I think I should take a matches. Because I can make fire with match and I can cook or keep warm in the desert island. Also I think I had better take a knife. With knife I can cut something easily. Last I have to take a flashlight. Maybe I can't walk around without flashlight at night. I think I should bring water. Maybe It is difficult to find clean water near the island.
