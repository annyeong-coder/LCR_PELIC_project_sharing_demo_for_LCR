I have ever heard the experiment about the effect of smell among the people like this article. In this experiment some people are divided into 2 groups according to their sexuality. And women were blinded and smelled at some men and according to only the smell they chose their favorite man. As a result of genetic investigation people chose their partners who had most different HLA type. HLA is a certain genetic lesion which decides one's individuality and which makes one be only oneself. Every human beings have different HLA types. The hybridization between genetically close people is dangerous because of the high incidence rate of genetic diseases. So the result of this experiment and the content of this article are reasonable for preventing these diseases and keeping species. But about choosing our Soul Mate I think the main reason of which one loves someone is not one's smell but all of his or her surroundings appearance personality etc as mentioned in the first paragraph. The ability stated in this article is certainly must be an instinct of human beings. But human is more sophisticated creature I think.
