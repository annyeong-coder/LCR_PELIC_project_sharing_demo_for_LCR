The trilogy all of which were based on the novel of the same name by Mario Puzo. The series most of which I've seen are the story about pirates. The actors some of whom are infamous impressed me a lot by their acting. The film directed by Quentin Tarantino used approximately US 60 000 of the movie's budget for producing swords and sword accessories. The animation starring Mike Myers Eddie Murphy and Cameron ANON_NAME_0 was based on several fairy tales. The movie based on the Broadway musical which tells the infamous story of Benjamin Barker is one of my favorite movies.
