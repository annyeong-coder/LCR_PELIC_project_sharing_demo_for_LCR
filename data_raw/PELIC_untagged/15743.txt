I grew up in a small Siberian village. Our family my parents and two sisters lived in a big house on the river side. My Aunt Galina and Uncle Alexander and their families lived not far away from us. Our families frequently gathered together in the home of our grandmother Paulina. My grandmother was the most important person for me and influenced me greatly. She was a really small petite woman with gray blue eyes and long gray hair. She always wore an apron and woolens. She spoke Russian with a slight accent because she was born in a region of the Soviet Union where people spoke German. We the children often made fun of her accent. Grandmother Paulina had an interesting and tragic history. During World War II families of German descent were banished from their homes and sent to Siberia. Men were put in prisons or sent to labor camps. With her nine children she had to start a new life in a new place. I loved spending time with my grandmother Paulina. She told me stories about her life about my great grandmother and great grandfather and other relatives. She never complained about how difficult life was for her. I always admired her courage and endurance.
