One of environmental problems in my country is about the project Making a Giant Canal which has been asserted by sitting president. The project is to make the big canal connecting main 4 rivers and is expected to decrease unemployment rate and provide citizens with a variety of leisure facilities. On the other hand many environmentalists are averse to this project because it is forecasted to trigger lots of pollution. They sneered the idea making boom in the economy through the canal can be heard just in undeveloped countries and have been campaigning to prohibit the start of this project. However the government has already made the a blueprint about this project the project started to be implemented as the blueprint.
