If I go to exploration. I will bring a watch some fireworks and fresh water. Because the watch can help me know what time and the watch can to do a compass. The fireworks can help me to back the food or do my lamp the fresh water is important because it can save you life. If I can take other thing for my trip I will take first aid kit because it can cave my life on the first time when I have problem or my partner. So those things are that I take when I go to exploration.
