In Korea we have some real TV documentary about people who are in trouble. Last winter I saw an episode in that documentary. It was a story about single mom and her two little children. They were poor but happy. The single mom was a street vendor to sell bread during winter. That bread with mashed red beans is usually sold during winter in Korea. She got a severe status cancer but she couldn't quit her work because this was only income in that family. Although she had gotten secondary anticancer treat her cancer came out again. She couldn't live her children together during her cure. So she left her children in a day care center every weekdays and they could meet only during weekends every two weeks. She sufferd severly from her painful cancer. The documentary showed her pain as it was. But above all what I felt most compassionate was her children. Her 7 year old daughter already became grown up. The little girl always took care of her brother who was 2 years younger than her instead of sick mom. She always gave her younger brother a bath made a meal and washed the dishes. My heart was choked with sorrow seeing that the little kids were firm and full fledged even if their mom couldn't live together. That story just was over showing that the single mom quitted her job to live with her children and started third anticancer treat. When I saw this story I could not stop weeping from the beginning to end. I really hope that the family will be happy.
