Many scientists have recently been discussing the importance of birth order. Some scientists argue that birth order has effect on the intelligence of siblings. On the other hand other scientists say that there is no relation between birth order and smarts. According to some scientists who insist on the evidence of the relation between birth order and intelligence there are several reasons for thinking that firstborns are smarter than their brothers or sisters. They say Mother's body is attacking the later offspring . They also refer to inequity of attention to children. Middleborns cannot be the only one kid in the house. One scientist says that parents sometimes make the older kids assist their parents and this experience has a good effect on older kids. In brief there are some opinions about the importance of birth and it has not been clear whether birth order affects the intelligence of siblings or not.
