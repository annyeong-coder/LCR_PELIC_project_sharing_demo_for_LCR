In this Paragraph they are talking about a journey in an American imaginary retirement city. Andrew D. Blechman explains the event when he went and visited two of his friends in a retirement community called the village. Then he was talking about a music station which was playing a song called The Candy Man Can . Later on he said that he is feeling claustrophobic and uneasy about himself living in a gated retirement community for the coming month Lines 17 20 . He met his friend ANON_NAME_0 outside Starbucks standing close to her red sports car. From ANON_NAME_0's perspective it is a very nice place to live in Lines 33 36 . Then he went and sat with ANON_NAME_0 and started catching up on their neighbors' gossip. After being stung by ANON_NAME_0's comments he understands that this life is a more carefree than in was back home lines 42 48 . Again ANON_NAME_0 assures him how everyone is happy and friendly and he should make himself comfortable at their home Lines 66 68 . In my opinion I will feel the same as the author because I want to live in a place that I don't feel I'm surrounded by walls and be surrounded with a category of senior residents. I want to live among my family and friends and catch up on gossip of my society. When I am about to pass away I want to see people around me that I shared my thoughts and feelings with.
