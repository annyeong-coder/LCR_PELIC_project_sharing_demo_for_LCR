Simon who has known me for twelve years is my best friend. He was born in Tainan where is my hometown. We went to the same high school and we became friends at that time. At first I didn't know him very much and we didn't have lots of interaction. Gradually I found that he liked to play basketball which is my favorite sport. One day after school he asked me to play basketball with him and we played until the sky becoming dark. After that day we often played together and talked about each other. We always talked about basketball games and Michael Jordan whose basketball's skill was excellent. Besides playing we often helped each other when we encountered difficult situations at school. Now we have been gone from high school for many years. We still keep in touch by cell phone or email. He is real my good friend that I never forget.
