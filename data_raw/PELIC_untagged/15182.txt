Welcome! I'm JIHA. Just a moment. Let me introduce myself. I have been living in Korea my whole life. I have had a lot of hobby. Talking with my humorous friends and climbing mountains with my family etc. They always please me. I have been studying science in university since 2008. Especially I have been interesting in the astronomy. I built this website to share mysterious and interesting things about the astronomy. I have uploaded a lot of articles and I have posted many photos about the Cosmos the Galaxy planets and stars and so on. If you have been having the same interest you can find the pleasure in my website. When I made this website I was helped by Science News ANON_URLSITE_. There are a lot of informations not only the astronomy but also whole things about science. You can enter the site to click a link in the bottom. Thanks and enjoy your time.
