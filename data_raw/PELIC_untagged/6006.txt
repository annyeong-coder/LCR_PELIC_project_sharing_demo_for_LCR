Thesis statement After I came to the U. S I found it difficult to adjust to American custom to wear shoes in a house. I knew the custom before I came here but I found it hard to accept it in my actual life. 1. When I moved to a present apartment many people like maintenance persons and cable TV engineers came to it. I asked them to take off their shoes when they entered my room but they said No. They told me that they were not allowed to take off their shoes on the job for some security reasons. I had to vacuum clean the room after they left. 2. When I visited American friends they said that I could wear my shoes in the house. I felt uncomfortable and I thought how they would feel if I ask them to take off their shoes when they visit my apartment. One of my American friends said he would feel uncomfortable if he takes off his shoes when he visits someone's house for the first time. 3. I can see many people sitting on the ground on the streets and malls. I was told not to sit or put my bag on the ground when I was a child because germs and dirt will adhere to them. Japanese are sometimes too particular for being clean. That may be partly because we take off our shoes inside of the house. I grew up in such surroundings and now it is hard to change the habit.
