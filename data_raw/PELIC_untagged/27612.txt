I always turn off the lights to save electricity because I have a budget. I throw out a trash every week. When my home is messy or dirty I feel ba so I clean up my house 2 times each week. I like the art that I put it up on the wall. I hang my clothes up into a closet to more organized. I like to move a furniture around to make a new look for my house.
