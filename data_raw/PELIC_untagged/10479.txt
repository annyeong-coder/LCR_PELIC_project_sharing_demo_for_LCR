My plans after I graduate from high school. My plans in Jordan for the university. My plans in America. I will talk about my planes that didn't turn out the way that I planned. First when I finished the high school I planned to apply in Aramco company and I made the test and I passed but they didn't accepted me because there are many people who have grades more than me. After this I went to Sabic company but also they didn't accepted me. Then I went to military in the sky force because I was thin. After this I went to the Petrol University but also they didn't accepted me I don't know why. Then I went to Jordan because my family were there and because I want to study my bachelor in Jordan. After this I have desired to go to America because I want study English language and I want to know about the American life style so I apply in the ELI of university of Pittsburgh and they give me my admission and the I 20 then I went to the American embassy to get my visa but they gave me a late appointment but when I explained my problem to them that I should go to America before 1 7 2008 they understood my problem and gave me earlier appointment so I got my visa and traveled to America. I planed to study in America and hope it will come true and these were all my plans that didn't turn the way that I planed.
