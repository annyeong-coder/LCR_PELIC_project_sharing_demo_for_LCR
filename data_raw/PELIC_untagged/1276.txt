Topic To be a chief nurse One of the things that I have been successful was to be a chief nurse about three years ago. One of the things that contributed to success was that I strived strict training after work with my colleague. For example I touched their vein and took a blood. The second thing that contributed to success was that I attend all workshops in my hospital. I went to the hospital even I took a day off to get more knowledge. The final thing that contributed to success was that I worked at some sections to experience a lot of technique such as ICU HCU and ER etc. I saw a lot of patients who sustained a terrible injury and had severe pain. I thought that it was important to get a broad knowledge and accurate technique for taking care of patients.
