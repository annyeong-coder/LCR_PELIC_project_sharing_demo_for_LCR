I heard in the news two months ago that a jewelry store in squirrel hill was being stolen by a young man. The witnesses in this case are two pedestrians who were walking by when they heard a gun shot. The robbery happened around 11 30 P. M when most of the stores were closed. The owner had been shot and he is now in the hospital. The witnesses were questioned by the police. Then they were interviewed by the local T. V station. They described the suspect as a tall white male with an old car. The scenario hasn't been released yet. But the owner informed the police that he had seen the suspect before. Yesterday I was watching local news when that crime has been mentioned. They said that the suspect was arrested while he was selling the stolen jewelry. He was taken to jail and he was interrogated and he confessed his crime. He has been guarded by the county jail police while waiting to face the judge. It is necessary to mention that the owner resume his normal activity a week after the robbery. And he is trying to reopen his store. The thief went to the court and he received ten years in jail.
