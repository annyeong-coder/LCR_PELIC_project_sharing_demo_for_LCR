Oct 23 2006 Dear Soon I am considering buying a new computer because my computer is not working. I don't know much about computer so I wanted to get your opinion on what should I buy. Could you give me a piece of advice I have found two different computer that are within my price range but I think that I like the notebook computer better that the desktop computer for two different reasons. First I think a notebook computer is lighter than a desktop computer so a notebook computer is more portable than a desktop computer. From my own personal experience I have used a desktop computer for 8 years but I have never brought my computer at school because it is too heavy. It is not portable like a notebook computer. Second I think a notebook computer is smaller than a desktop computer so a notebook computer is more useful than a desktop computer. For example my desk is very small so I can't put lots of thing on my desk. If I buy a desktop computer than I should put a monitor a speaker system on my desk. However if I buy a notebook computer than I can put only a small notebook. Because a notebook computer is included a monitor and speaker system. I want to use a computer at home and school and I need enough space on my desk. So I prefer a notebook computer rather than a desktop computer. However I have a negative reason about a notebook computer. A notebook computer is more expensive than a desktop computer. For example if I buy a notebook computer the cost is about 1500. However if I buy a desktop computer the cost is about 1000. This notebook computer and desktop computer have similar specifications but the notebook computer and the desktop computer are different prices. So please write back and let me know what you think about these two different computers. I am waiting your answer. Thank you so much and hope to hear from you soon. Bye. Love SGY
