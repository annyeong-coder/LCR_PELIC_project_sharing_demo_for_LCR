Several months ago while I was walking through a street I witnessed an accident and everyone was surprised at that time. An red car was struck by a following big truck at the cross of two streets. The traffic was soon suspended by this accident. Meanwhile smoke was emitted from the red car. It seemed this wounded car would burn immediately. Fire brigade was called and firefighters soon came to the spot. An old lady was rescued from the red car. Obviously She was suffering serious injure because blood could be found on her clothes. The smoke was soon put down after the firefighter had arrived. However it was still a terrible accident.
