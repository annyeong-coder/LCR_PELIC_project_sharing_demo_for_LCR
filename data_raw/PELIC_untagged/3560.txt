ELI school provides very efficient teaching programs that you can be satisfied with. You may enjoy your each seperated class with great teacher. Furthermore there are many extra classes like talk time with native speakers TGIF volunteering for people who need some assistances that you might make you be excited with. However you should have your own chances with American people talking in English as much as you can as well. You can choose some types of housing as you want but I recommend you to choose homestay housing. That type is really helpful for you because you can learn experience the real American life and have many conversations with. By going through all these things you must become a great Emglish user. In addition Pittsburgh is a really nice city to live so it might be a great time in this city with ELI program.
