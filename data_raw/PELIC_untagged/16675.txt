Hi I'm studying English at ELI and I will do my master degree later on. I want to have my own business such as a tour company because I like to travel so I can make money and travel in the same time. I want to go to Egypt Greece Rome. When I was undergraduate student I studied philosophy of law. I fall in love with their history and philosophy. Not only you can make money while you travel but also you write a book and publish it. Write about the place you visit. In fact one of my friends and I had a plan to study in England not in the state because we want to take a train from London to Moscow. It will takes 14 days. Also we want to take a train back to Bangkok Thailand too. Our inspiration is a famous Thai actor he has travelogue. It's about traveling to other country by train. However I know this kind of business is risk and need a lot of money to prepare for everything.
