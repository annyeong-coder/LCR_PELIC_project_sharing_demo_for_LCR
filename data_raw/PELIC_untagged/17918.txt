When I was high school student I met a best friend whose name is Mihoko. She and I have a same hobby which is music. We love many kind of music which are classic rock and techno. Mihoko who is a pianist knows a lot of music. Usually I go to concerts with her because of her knowledge of music is very useful for me. Now she lives in Nagoya which is my home town. When I go back to Japan I want to see her.
