Reviewer Hernan Martinez Millan Movie Review The King's Speech An extraordinary movie that you can watch in these days is The King's Speech. This movie starring Colin Firth which has received many prizes since Firth's performance is really outstanding in the history of cinema. The King's Speech was inspired by a real story that took place in England. Colin Firth who is the main character represents George VI. George VI was a duke who became King since his brother abdicated. The plot of this amazing movie focuses on the linguistic difficulties that George VI suffered which triggered for him a lot of political problems. The central fact in this movie is about the relation between the King and his doctor to whom he entrusts the task of helping the King to overcome his stutter. This beautiful and deep movie which explores many crucial aspects of the life of George VI narrates the story of this process of learning since the King who had the challenge of speaking in public without a stutter should announce the Second World War to his land. This movie is not only dramatic but also it's funny which has been a crucial factor to turn it into a success. The linguistic therapy which not only involves professional help but also a personal relationship between the King and his doctor is unusual funny painful sad and difficult. Definitely The King's Speech is an extraordinary movie which has been reviewed very well. If you have not watched this lovely movie I think this is a great opportunity to do it. Most of the people who watched this movie had a very positive opinion about the role of the characters and the scenery in which it was made.
