These foods aren't real diet foods for these reasons 1 SMOOTHIES because they often don't have fresh fruits but only concentrate of fruit and they don't contain low fat yogurt. 2 ENERGY BARS because they very often have a lot of calories for example 500 calories each so we should choose only those with maximum 200 calories each. 3 YOGURT we should choose only no fat or low fat yogurt. 4 SALAD DRESSING they are too rich in salt. 5 MUFFINS two things are important. First it is important the serving size which should be small. In the label are indicated calories only per serving and probably a muffin is two servings. Second even if in the label we read low fat there is high sugar .
