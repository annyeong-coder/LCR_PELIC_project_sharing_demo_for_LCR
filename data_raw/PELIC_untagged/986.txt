Education is one of the issues the people take care of . It is important that for person to be educated because it is indicator for the person. Some people argue with that and they believe it is not important to be educated and get high degree. A lot of people when they want to ask for advice they get confused who will they ask the educated people or uneducated people. Good advices we can take it form both of them. Each of them has their own experience in their fields. In my country we have common say ask the expert and don't ask the doctor and that is mean ask people who has experience in that filed and don't the person who doesn't has experiences and has just theories. In my opinion I believe we must ask someone has experience with that matter he already has done it and has information about it. Science is important and we can't ignore its point of view. The person who studies and he has spent almost 16 years in elementary school in middle school and in university. He must has a good advice but without experience. When we searching for advice we might ask the person has experience and the person has the knowledge. In other meaning we should mix the experience with the theory.
