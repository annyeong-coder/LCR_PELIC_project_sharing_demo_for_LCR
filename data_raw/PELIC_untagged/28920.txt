When I rented an apartment I didn't have any furniture. I remained one week that I didn't have any things in my apartment. Then I went to store which I bought from. I bought some furniture not all because my brother discouraged me to bought all things in one time. So I should have bought other furniture to my apartment. I shouldn't have listened to my brother. I could have bought all things one time instead I bought just some things.
