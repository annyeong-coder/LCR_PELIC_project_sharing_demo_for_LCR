How to save money Learning to save money is not always easy. Many people have asked specially students how to save money As a student I have learned good tips of saving money. First of all transportation come the biggest restrictive for students. I suggest walking or riding a bicycle to the university. Also I live with a roommate. My roommate and I share the rent and the bills. Therefore I don't go to the restaurants. I make my meals with my roommate so it is cheaper. Also you could save money by buying your clothes from a second hand stories. You can find some very cheap decent clothes in those stories. Moreover I hardly go to the movies. I usually rent videos and split the coast with my roommate so it is cheaper. Finally I have a part time job. I could save some money and have money for my personal expenses. I stick to my budget carefully so I don't have to borrow. I don't like to owe people money. I hope those tips will help to save money.
