It was a beautiful Sunday. I woke up a little bit late because it was my weekend. It was so relax in a peaceful and quiet house nobody was home. In a sudden I heard the phone rang. I picked it up and it was for my mom. I told the person who called that she wasn't home and asked her if she would like to leave the message. She said it was ok. She will call her back. So I hung up and was going to get ready and get my day start. The phone rang again and I hesitated to pick it up because nobody was home and if it was my friends they would call my cell phone. But I couldnt ignore it. Finally I picked it up. Along the line a woman voice called my name and asked if I remembered her. I said yes I was speaking but I couldnt figure it out who she was. Anyway she asked me if I signed up for Zumba class on next Saturday which was a new session. I thought I did but I wasn't sure because I skipped the class for personal reasons so I told her to hold on. Then I went to my room got my organizer and looked it up for my class schedule. I picked up the phone and said yes. Finally I found out that she was my instructor. We kept on talking for a while because she came up with the plans and stories. She asked me about my plans I said I didn't really have plans so she asked me if I wanted to join her. So we ended up spent a beautiful Sunday together and I had a lot of fun.
