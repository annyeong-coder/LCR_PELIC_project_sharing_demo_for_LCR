Topic Who would be your best roommate ANON_NAME_0 chul would be a good roommate for me. First of all he and I have almost the same daily routine. For example he wakes up at 7 30A. M and I wake up between 7 30 8 00A. M. He goes to work between 8 20 8 30A. M and so do I. He always eats dinner around 7 30 8 00P. M. I normally eat dinner eat dinner between 7 30 8 00 P. M so we could eat together. Eating dinner with someone is one of the most important things. The second reason is that we have similar hobbies. He likes watching movies and playing soccer. I also like watching any kind of movie drama and action TV shows. And he likes shopping and so do I. We can be flexible with our time also. He takes a shower at 8 00A. M and I normally take a shower around 11 00P. M. So we won't interfere with each other and we can save time. Finally the most important reason I like his personality. He is honest and modest.
