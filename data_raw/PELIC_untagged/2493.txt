My life in 1997 In 1997 I had been living in Dea Gu city South Korea since I had been born in that city. I had been going to the university. On Feb. Of 1997 I graduated from my university. But I had not been able to get the job. So I had started studing for the job test. When I had been studing hard I had met my future husband.
