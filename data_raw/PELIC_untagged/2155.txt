It is very nice weather this is beginning a good day for people. This is a ravine as far from progress so people use feet is transportation. In the village no light and water people use everything from nature everywhere has green color in a deep forest. About 11 cottages in front me it is very small look like mushroom is emerging from the earth. The roof made from dry hay some house has a black color seem mushroom is going a decomposed fungus are visiting pretty soon some house has a yellow color like the sun is shining. All most a wall made from the wood that does not help to protect the coolness everyone will need a blanket when the winter came in. Although this place does not have a technology but it is an undisturbed it a good idea when I open eyes to learn a way of life another people who poorer than me.
