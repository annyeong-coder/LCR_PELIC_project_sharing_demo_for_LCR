I met my best friend Chika while I was working in Japan. About three years ago I was working at a hospital as a doctor. Oneday while I was working as usual she came into my examination room as an outpatient. She was suffering from conjunctivitis. After that she came to see me twice as a patient. Finally she became my best friend and now we email each other everyday.
