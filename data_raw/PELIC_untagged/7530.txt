Before I came in Pittsburgh I have lived in Seoul. I was born in Seoul. Actually I grew up in Seoul so I know Seoul's information. Even though I have lived in Pittsburgh for 10 month I can be accustomed to live in here and I may a little know here. Pittsburgh and Seoul have several differences such as transportation weather buildings. Now I will compare my hometown with Pittsburgh. First Seoul's transportation is different from Pittsburgh's one. Seoul is too complex city and big city such as New York. Also transportation complicate more than Pittsburgh's one. Seoul have many subway lanes so foreigner often lose the way or they can't find their destination easily. But Pittsburgh's citizen use rarely subway. Seoul has many buses and bus system is much developed. Also here has many buses and many people use bus but I think Seoul's bus is more than Pittsburgh's one. Second Seoul's buildings are different from Pittsburgh's buildings. Seoul has much high buildings and much apartments. Especially Seoul has high population and is not enough space so there is much apartments over 15th. Pittsburgh's buildings is not much high except downtown almost all buildings and apartments are not high so I can see sky clearly in here but Seoul is blocked by high buildings. Third Seoul's weather is different from Pittsburgh's weather. In summer Seoul too much rains and humid. I don't like this weather because I have much sweat. So uncomfortable degree is much high and Seoul's rate of crime goes up. Pittsburgh's weather is wet so clothes are dried easily. And here's weather is changeable so our feeling is changed easily. Seoul's winter weather is as much cold as Pittsburgh's winter weather and Both of them snow much. I compared Pittsburgh and Seoul through transportation buildings and weather. I think both of them has each advantages and I can't think which city is better. I think Pittsburgh and Seoul are so beautiful city.
