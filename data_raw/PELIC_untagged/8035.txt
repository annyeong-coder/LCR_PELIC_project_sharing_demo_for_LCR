My favorite holiday is the Dragon Boat Festival which is on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month. On that day people always eat a special traditional food Zong Zi which is a pyramid shaped rice ball wraped in 2 bamboo leaves. People in different regions use different recipes. Normally there are two kinds of Zong Zi. One is sweety and the other is salty. The sweety Zong Zi is made of sweet rice only. People like to eat it with sugar. For the salty Zong Zi the ingredients are some baby shrimp mushroom chops of bamboos several pieces of peanuts and a yolk. All of them are embraced by sweet rice. After these ingradients are wrapped by bamboo leaves people either steam it or boil it. Then it becomes a tasty food. One thing should be concerned that do not eat too many Zong Zi because sweet rice is not easy to be digested.
