The first thing I'd like to point out is that you can save your time and money to pick up your children from a day care center. If there is a day care center in your University you don't have to hurry to pick up your children from a day care center. For example when I worked in a lab there were many mothers who had children. In their case they have to finish their experiments until 4 or 5 pm because they have to go to a day care to pick up their children and most of them can not have enough time to finish their work so they are always tired. Like time saving you can also save the money for fuel. If there is a day care center near your work place you can also save the money for fuel but at least your have to drive your car and pull over some place to pick up your children. Thus the cay care in your University is more economic place than any other place to pick up your children.
