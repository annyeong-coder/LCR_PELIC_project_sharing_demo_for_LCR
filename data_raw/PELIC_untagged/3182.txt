The Military Service of Korea There are many kinds of Military Service in Korea for instance the army the navy and the Airforce. In my opinion 99 of Korean men don't want to go to the Military Service or they're unwilling to enter the Military Service but they are reguired to enlist. It seems that they've been feeling that it's not necessary and is useless for their life. Most Korean men think that it would throw two years of their lives away. It became our responsibility and duty since the War of Korea by the North began. However I recommend entering in the Military Service. I still believe that most young men would grow up if they had the experience of Military Service. I have two specific reasons for this. First they would learn to take care of themselves. Second they would Know what to do in a problem or emergency. If my opinion is correct they'll be able to make better lives than before.
