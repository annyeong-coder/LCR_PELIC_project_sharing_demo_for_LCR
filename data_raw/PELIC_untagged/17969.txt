Friendship is a plant which we must often water. I think this means that we have to take care of our friends. Good friends that ask about each other and help each other. For example ANON_NAME_0 who is my best friend and lives in Libya calls me every weekend. Also my friend is a person who respects and trusts me well because the respect and trust are things which maintain the friendship. For example ANON_NAME_0's problems which happen last year disband when I helped him. In conclusion my friend and I are people whose friends are important to us
