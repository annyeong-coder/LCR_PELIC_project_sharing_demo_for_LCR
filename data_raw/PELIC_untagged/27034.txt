Hello everyone! I have been managing this website for one year. I have lived in Seoul my whole life. So I saw that there had many beautiful landscapes. I have taken photos for three years. At first I didn't make good photos before understood about camera angles. After that I have been shooting a lot of Seoul's scenes. I have shared photographs with friends and they have given a advice that build a website. I finished the work in this year. I have written this page to show Seoul's beautiful scenes.
