When I was a freshman in a college I had a girlfriend. At that time I was always late my class because of sleeping so she woke me up. Even though I didn't pick up her calling she didn't give me up and she went on calling. It happened one day I couldn't wake up and suddenly I heard the cell phone ringing. However I couldn't find my cell phone. Since the phone rang two times I found my cell phone. The cell phone rang again I was certain that she called me back. I said hold on 10 minutes I'll take a shower baby However I ended up the responding. I'm your father. I had to hang up my cell phone. I didn't think over the caller. At that night I had to talk my father into that it was misunderstanding.
