My favorite meal is a pasta. Especially I enjoy fettccini with shrimp and brocolli using alfredo sauce. I usually do not make this pasta but sometimes I make my pasta on a special day or weekends. I'll recommend you my pasta recipe. First I prepare fettuccini and put them in a boiling water for 6 7 minutes. If you want to check fetuccini proper boiled you throw one of them onto the wall. If it is sticked to the wall well it shows you fetuccini well boiled. During this process we also should prepare shrimps and brocollis. I bake shrimps a little bit and brocollis are boliing a little bit. And then I make alfredo sauce. To make this sauce we need milk cream and cheese. I boil it for 3 5 minutes after I mix them. Some seasoning is followed by this process. I usually season the sauce with a little bit garlic. Using garlic is much better than not using it because garlic make our taste increase and make other materials harmony well. Finally you just enjoy it. In your dish you put fettuccini baked shrimps and brocollis. And you pour your alfredo sauce on it. This recipe is so simple and you can enjoy this tasty meal conveniently anytime. Moreover it does not much time and much materials. So I will hope you enjoy this meal anytime.
