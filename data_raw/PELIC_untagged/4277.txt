When I was middle school I met this teacher. She is Kyoungbok Kim. She taught me about history. There was special program in Korea. It's kind of entrance examination. So If I'd like to enter the best high school I should study very hard. At that time she always made us study very hardly. Some students contradicted her but she tried to mend one's ways. Also some students asked something to her she always answered a question and she had them research about that. But she hadn't forced to study. When I want to read my favorite book during the break time she let me read the book. And she got us to exercise for the health. I think she always helped me everything.
