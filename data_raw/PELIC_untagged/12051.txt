Same things weather a lot of sports teams bus Different things subway people size price downtown safe Before I came Pittsburgh I lived in Seoul. I like both cities because both cities give me good experience. I think Pittsburgh is my second hometown. I will analyze the similarities and differences between the two cities. Two cities have a lot in common. First of all the weather in Seoul is like the weather in Pittsburgh. They have spring summer fall and winter. Some another country's people think Pittsburgh is very strange for them. However I didn't think about that. Second both cities have a lot of sports teams. Seoul has basketball team two baseball teams soccer team etc. Likewise Pittsburgh has football team baseball team ice hockey team etc. Next Pittsburgh has an efficient bus system and Seoul does too. Many students usually take bus so a good bus system is good for them. The other hand two cities have a lot of different things. First Seoul is bigger than Pittsburgh. Seoul is very big city in the world but Pittsburgh is small city. Second many people are living in Seoul. However a little people are living in Pittsburgh. Because Seoul is Korea capital many people are living in Seoul. In addition whereas Seoul has a good subway system Pittsburgh has not a good subway system. Because Seoul has a good subway system you can easily go to anywhere when you want to go anywhere. Finally Seoul's downtown is very safe at night. In contrast Pittsburgh's downtown is dangerous at night. Many people are playing in Seoul at night so it is very safe. Also having gun is illegal in Korea. Like these I analyze the two cities. Both cities are good for me. Sometimes I am missing Seoul but Pittsburgh gives me the good memories. I will enjoy in Pittsburgh life. Later I return to Seoul I will miss Pittsburgh.
