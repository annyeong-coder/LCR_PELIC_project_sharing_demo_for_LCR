One time I went to my Bank to fill out an application. While I was filling out my application a bank employee told me about a competition to win a thousand dollar but I have to sign up for this competition. I signed up for this competition and I left home. After two weeks my cell phone was ringing and picked up. It was the bank telling me that I won the one thousand dollar. In the beginning I tried to figure out if it was true or a friend was joking. I asked him to provide me his number and I told him that will call him back. I hanged up and I called him back to make sure. I found out that I really won the thousand dollars. In that time I run out of money so it helped me out and cheered me up. I went to the Bank and I talked to reception about my winning. He asked me to sit down and wait. Then an employee called my name and asked me to look over conditions and write down my name. I ended up taking those one thousand dollars after a long process.
