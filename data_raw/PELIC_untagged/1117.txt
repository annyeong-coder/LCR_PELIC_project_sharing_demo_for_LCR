Moats is my best friend he was studying with me in the primarry med and high school. Iremeber that when we have met in the class for the first time we were young and we fought to gather but I dont know why after that we have been friends. We made many things to gather we gathered a soccer team when we were in the 4TH grade two years ago we have traveled to egypt to gather and that was a very nice trip we did every thing there we visited many musuems we rented a small boat with our friends and we took a small turn on the nile river in Cairo. In last Jan I moved to U. S to complete my education but he still my best friend.
