Last night I met my best friend. We could have had dinner and said good bye but we went to a bar after dinner. Because we drank too much we were extremely drunk and we had to pay much money. Looking back we should have drunk a little. We might have drunk just a beer but we ordered Jack Daniel. If we drank a little we didn't have to pay a lot of money. If we go to a bar next time we should be sure that we can't order expensive liquor. Instead we should order a beer.
