The most important thing I learned this semester. Since I started at the ELI I have learned several things about other cultures. I have met many students from different regions all over the world. They are friendly and they allow me to know the most important things about their countries. In addition to that I have known the distinct factors that has made the international people come to the US. It was obvious for me that although we are from different places we still have something in common such as our impression on Pittsburgh food Weather and people. The most important aspect that I have improved of learning English this semester is grammar. Before I came to The ELI I studied little grammar rules at high school long time ago. Initially it was tough but then I did well. The grammar which I have learned helped me improve my writing and speaking as well. I am really satisfied of what I have achieved but I have to work hard in the next few months. I have to rely on my self to acquire more writing skills that help me to be successful in my TOEFL exam
