In my opinion face to face communication is more preferable when you trying to meet someone. One of reason for me it is more enjoyable and familiar because feelings and emotions are more evident and noticeable. For example when I met an eligible guy I can watch the traits of his face directly. If you feel intimate you can disclose own story to him. Another reason for me it is secure from meeting a stranger. For instance a girl meets a guy who does not know each other they should regard etiquette. Maybe they talk rigid rules but it is truthful stories. The last reason for me it can do outside interests together. Such as we can eat dinner go to the movies and play the tennis etc. Because of enjoyable and familiar being secure from meeting and doing outside interests together I think face to face communication is more preferable when you trying to meet someone.
