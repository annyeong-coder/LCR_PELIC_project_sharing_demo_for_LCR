Beverages I like all kinds of beverages. There are many reasons why I like. First of all I drink a cup of hot coffee to wake up in the morning. If I drank to much coffee I will drink some milk to balance. Then at tea time a cup of English black tea with a piece of strawberry cake is my favorite. When I eat dinner I drink some wine. I like white wine. It's not too strong and it's easy to drink. Next if I eat too much I like to drink some green tea without sugar because green tea helps to digest food. Finally orange juice is my favorite now. I can drink a bottle of orange juice everyday. I need beverages anytime anywhere. I have a lot of beverages in my life.
