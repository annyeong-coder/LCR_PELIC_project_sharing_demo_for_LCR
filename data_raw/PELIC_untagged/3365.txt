Dear Dr. ANON_NAME_0 Regarding to Saudi Day that will be held on next week we have already prepared most of our tasks. I've already called the contact person at Saudi Arabia embassy to ask him about the pictures posters gifts and some of cities model. He told me they have already all the upper things except the models that they have already required them from H. Q. Stores but they haven't answered yet. However ANON_NAME_1 Has already reserved the hall and data show from Pitt for tow days. But he hasn't bought the purchases yet because his credit card hasn't activated yet. Don't wary I'll flow all things by myself to finish it on the target date. B. R. ANON_NAME_2
