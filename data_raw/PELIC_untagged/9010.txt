I agree the opinions from the text so we should begin by asking state legislators to enact the laws. Our human environment is very important and also very close to our dauly life thus we need to take care them. Now the author gave us suggestion to protect our right and also avoid being bad corporations. Therefore we have to create the law to prevent harmimg our resources. According to the article the pursuit of profits muct not come at expense of the environment human rights public health and safety the dignity of employees or the welfare of communities. I think it is very good idea to protect our human rights because the coporations can't just think about the benefits and also are necessary to think about the daily life which they are involived in everyday. For these reasons create the laws is very crutical.
