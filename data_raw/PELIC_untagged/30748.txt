We can use the great ability of the animals to improve the human life. For example crows were so intelligent that can think logically. Therefore we can train them to help human's work. Another example is that Geckos have a surprising ability to climb on any surface. We can make the super climbing robot by learning about geckos' climbing mechanism. In conclusion it is important for us to make the good partnership between animals and humans. At the same time we should conserve the environment of the wildlife which has a capacity of developing our life.
