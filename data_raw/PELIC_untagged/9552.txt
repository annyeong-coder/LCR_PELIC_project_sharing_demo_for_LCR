Friday morning I was very unlucky. I got up at 6 00 because my girlfriend called me. Then I get up. First I took a shower. Second I ate breakfast but it wasn't good. Third I didn't find my belt because my apartment was very messy. Then I waited for the bus for 20 minutes. Finally the bus came but it was full so I waited again. I didn't like waiting for the bus in the morning when it was rainy. All my clothes were wet.
