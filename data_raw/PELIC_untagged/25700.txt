I was working for a TV station for about seven years when I was in Japan. My corporation's headquarters were in Nagoya which is located between Tokyo and Osaka and I worked in Osaka branch. Because Osaka branch had only one section a sales department there were only nine people including me. My role was a sales assistant for all the members and also kind of a secretary for a branch president. I often undertook a lot of different assignments coincidently from my colleagues. I didn't know the reason that why they asked me at the same time but this situation frequently happened. Because of this busy state of affairs I needed to weigh what is the most important and urgent thing and then got to work that task first. In addition it was also necessary to consider colleague's personalities and moods. Some of them were able to wait if the task was not urgent but the others were hasty and impatient even if it was not in a hurry. Although my job was in the office I always contacted business connection companies by phone. Most of time I didn't know their faces that the person whom I talked to so I tried to impress she or he favorably because if my impression was not good it was more difficult to go well my work. I also tried to explain clearly as possible as I could but not too much in order to avert troublesome issues. These are how I was working and consequently I think the profession as an assistant need to feel the atmosphere in the office and pay attention all member's individual work because these works are related to each other so that colleagues expect me to reply questions which appear occasionally. At first I did understand only my surrounded work but through some years I was able to acquire knowledge of my company's deeper information and these skills. I think I obtained instructive skills over experiences and it was very important to ask a lot of questions early few years.
