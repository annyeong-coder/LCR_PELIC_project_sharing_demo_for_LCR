My English study experience at the ELI is invaluable especially in this semester. I acknowledged that I was very lack in grammar and reading at the very beginning of the term. I tried hard to enhance my reading skills first and I also like to find out the underlying meaning of some vocabularies though studying prefixes stems and suffixes. I'm well adapted to the grammar teacher's way of teaching. However my midterm grade of grammar didn't conform what I had been tried. I felt uneasiness of my grammar midterm grade. I decided to transform to a different way of studying. Therefore I was reluctant but had to drop my afternoon classes because my listening teacher's class engrossed my attention a lot. I also struggled to pay more attention when I felt tired in my grammar class. I'll persist in improving English in order to pursue my dream as a native English speaker and writter. I'm astonished by the methods of reading skills. I appreciate my teachers and classmates' help.
