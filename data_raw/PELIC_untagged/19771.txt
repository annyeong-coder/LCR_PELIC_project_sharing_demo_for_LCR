I had a chance to travel to Atlanta Georgia at last weekend. I traveled with teachers and ELI students. We departed from Pittsburgh in different time because we got a different flight numbers. Unfortunately my flight was delayed so I arrived Atlanta an hour late. After that we took the train from the airport to the hotel. In the next morning we woke up and had breakfast at the hotel. Our first attraction was Atlanta History Center. In this place I saw many asymmetry statues of famous people during the civil war time in the U. S. In the afternoon we went to Georgia Aquarium. In my opinion I think this aquarium is thriving on because of lots of tourists. In the evening we had a special buffet dinner at Mary Mac's Tea Room one of the famous restaurants in Atlanta. The second day we visited CNN. We can see how they work and on air. I very appreciated the way they were working because they still working although we were seeing them through windows. After that we visited the World of Coca Cola. It's such a nice place. We can take photos with polar bears. Moreover we can taste many kinds of Coca Cola drink that are selling around the world. Furthermore we had chance to see Pandas at Zoo Atlanta. There are four pandas there. At the zoo I can see different kinds of animals that I never see in Thailand before such as a komodo dragon and a red panda. The last day of the trip is bad because it's raining all day long. We went to Botanical Garden during raining time so we cannot take many photos. For this reason we decided to back to the hotel and prepare to go to the airport. I have got very good experience in this trip. I have cumulate new friends and we can assimilate together even though we came from different backgrounds and countries.
