I have a nice and kind next door neighbor who loves helping people whenever she can. Her name is Virginia. Indeed she takes care of every thing around her without any one asks her to do that. Even though she is an older lady who has a lot of responsibility in her life such as works in her own small shop. In addition her daughter's children live with her. She takes care of them and makes sure that they go to their school and do their homework every day. Moreover she also helps her neighbors inside her building or outside. For instance she gives free lessons every day for Vietnam's kid who his parents do not speak English and they live about two blocks from her home. Additional example inside our building she brings residents' mail from the mail box every day and put it in front of their doors every morning. She is such a good and strong woman I have ever known.
