If only I had studied hard in my college. I wish I would gotten a job after I graduated. If my parents hadn't supported me I wouldn't have come to the U. S. If I hadn't come to the U. S. I wouldn't have known my American friends. If I hadn't known my American friends I wouldn't have chanced to practice my speaking skill. I wish The TOEFL exam would been easy. If I had passed the TOEFL exam before I came here I wouldn't have read the books everyday. If I had bought a car last semester I would have come to class early. If I hadn't come to class late I wouldn't have missed homework. If I hadn't missed homework I would've gotten better grade last semester.
