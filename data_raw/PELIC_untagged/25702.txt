I had never missed my bedroom before I came here. I figured out that how much I miss my bedroom recently. I remember every time when I lied down on my bed and sat down on my lovely chair. I used to do over my room arrangement that doesn't mean I straighten it up. I used to mix my staff up and I prefer to leave the task for our housekeeper. Once I go back home I will throw away my old Furniture and replace it by new one and might hang up a nice picture of me. This is the easiest part because I have many good pictures or I can say I make any picture brilliant!!
