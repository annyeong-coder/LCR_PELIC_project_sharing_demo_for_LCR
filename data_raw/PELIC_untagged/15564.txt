Illiteracy The concept of illiteracy is different from country to country. For example some countries consider a person who is not able to read and write illiterate other countries mean by illiteracy that a person who cannot reach a certain educational level that makes him understand written instructions in technical subjects in his work. What are the causes of illiteracy Since there is more than one definition of literacy there are different causes for each definition. This essay focuses on one of causes of illiteracy that is based on the first definition. Or traditional definition Illiteracy is usually widespread in poor countries. Therefore poverty is an important cause of illiteracy poverty creates uneducated environment because poor persons have different priorities that education comes last one in. Those priorities lie in providing basic needs of living. Poor parsons often work in arduous jobs thus they need help of their children. Therefore their children are deprived of learning. Moreover poor families are not able to pay for the cost of study for their children. Poverty plays a negative role in lives of parsons also has serious effects on societies. Shortly the development of nations is measured by their education. No doubt poverty underlies many social issues such as illiteracy. Illiteracy helps to deploy underdevelopment curb development and weaken production in communities. In my perspective poverty is an important cause of illiteracy. This is noted illiteracy is almost restricted in poor area or in poor families. Illiteracy deprives societies of benefit from potential energies that poor parsons have.
