On this weekend I didn't anticipate enjoying a lot of things. On Saturday I was walking on the Walnut street then I ran into my friend who was my former school classmate. We started chatting then I remembered that tonight I was invited party by my conversation partner but I hadn't asked anybody go with me. So I asked him. He aspired to go this event. At first I was reluctant to ask him because the party theme was ambiguous for me. At the party which was crammed with people was great. Interesting people amazing music many happy tunes triggered us dancing. We enjoyed this party a lot. On Sunday I went to the Monroeville Mall to see Zombie festival. I saw many people who put on the zombie makeup. For a while I was walking around there then I ran into a friend. I didn't expect to meet him. After that we tired to go the Pittsburgh zoo because on Sunday was free admission day. However we arrived late so the zoo was closed so we played basketball instead. Before the weekend I hadn't have a plan but out of the blue I ran into two friends. Eventually I spent fun time with them.
