Yolanda's mother believed in Yolanda's talent since she had seen a little Yolanda draw a crowd. Her mother might manipulate Yolanda to be a poet. Yolanda once became a poet as her mother hoped. Her mother who showed up in her recital of poet reading and told her indelicacy to the strangers arbitrarily threw her off. Her mother wanted Yolanda to be famous and pure so that she couldn't believe in sex for Yolanda. However real life of Yolanda changed differently from her mother's desire. She got divorced and had a relationship with her lover who is her supervisor. Furthermore she is not a poet anymore.
