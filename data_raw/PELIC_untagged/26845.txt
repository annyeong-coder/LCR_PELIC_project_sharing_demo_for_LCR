Open Your Eyes directed by Alejandro Amenavar is an amazing movie. I saw this movie the day before yesterday. This interesting movie featuring Penelope ANON_NAME_0 was reviwed in some important magazins. Penelope ANON_NAME_0 who is a very famouse spanish actriss plays the role of a woman that loves an obssesive man. This movie was filmed in Madrid where Alejandro Amenavar grow up and where Penelope ANON_NAME_0 dreamed of becoming a great actriss. The argument of this movie which is simple won many prizes in the Europena cinema. The main character in this movie had created a fictional reality which finaly became real for him. Cesar who was a successful man had believed that his fantastic world of dreams was real. As a result Cesar who has a girldfriend named Sofia who in this movie was played by Penelope ANON_NAME_0 ended up killing her. Open your eyes which is a strong criticizen of today's world is a great opportunity to rethink the relations between reality and dreams. As in others movies in which Penelope has worked her performace is extraordinary. Open your eyes analyzing the relation between reality and fantasy explores an interesting area of knowledge. As we know the border between reality and fantasy in many cases is unclear. This movie in which this border desappearce is a good example about the philosophical questions of reality versus imaginary world.
