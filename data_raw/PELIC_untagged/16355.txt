During my first week in Pittsburgh I had to learn a lot of things. First I learned how to use transportation. For example I learned how to catch a bus from Pittsburgh to my home in Irwin using the Westmoreland bus. Also I learned how to catch a bus from Wilkinsburg to school by the EBO bus. Secondly I learned how to pronounce other student's names from other countries. For example I learned how to pronounce student's names from Korea Saudi Arabia Turkey Thailand and others. Before I said their names I had only spoken words in Samoan or English. Thirdly I learned how to pick clothes to wear as a person studying in American culture. For example I learned how to wear clothes for the spring. In my country we almost always wear the same kinds of clothes everyday because of the climate tropical weather . Overall learning those three aspects of life in the United States during my first week in Pittsburgh helps me to stay happy and healthy.
