Industrial development only prevents environment from destroying Many environmentalists think environmental destruction is caused by developing the industries more and more. However we can often find out that the regulation and the law about environment are different between the developed countries and the developing countries on the media or in the book. Not only control the developed countries the law that is about environment severely but those countries rather invest a lot of money in keeping the environment away from ruin than the developing countries. The developed countries can maintain clean environment because the constant development in those countries make up the science and industry which have the ability to deal with environment. Comparing with the past the industries tend to change gradually to new industries which create additional values such as the design of product the reliability of product etc. Specifically industrial development in the past tended to pursue mass produce because manufacturers who didn't think over the environment destruction just wanted to earn money a lot. Nevertheless after industrial development developing industries got people to change their mind. Changed people started producing what they have intended which is immaterial factors that are capable of cutting down the possibility of environmental pollution. Consequently industrial development in the world let us perceive the importance of environment and it helps the environmental sustainability by making effective products Industrial development in the world offers the opportunity to recover the destructed environment. For example purification facility which equipments we should spend much time researching is made by industrial development helps us make the water that have been polluted by factories houses clean. Thus the possibility of preserving environment would get bigger if industries in the world are developed constantly
