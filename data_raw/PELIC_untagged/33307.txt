I painted our house last summer. The job took about two weeks. First I washed the exterior useing warm water and a mild detergent. Then with putty I sealed all the chinks and pores in the walls. After the putty had had a chance to dry I could paint the exterior. I used a latex paint because it is easy to apply and cleans up with water. We needed a whole to finish this part of the job. I was very careful to apply the paint evenly because I did not want to have to apply two coats. We used a color that was very close to the original color. Our house is a two story house which meant that we needed a tall ladder to do the second story. I could balance the paint on the top rung of the ladder while I worked. When I finished the job I felt a great deal of satisfaction. I had to pat myself on the back. Even my dad said that I did a good job.
