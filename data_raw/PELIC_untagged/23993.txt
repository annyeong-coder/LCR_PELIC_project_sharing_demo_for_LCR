It has been said during the war hatred and love are equal death and life are also equal but victory and defeat are not equal. Inhumanly weapons could be some times more valuable the souls of the people whether they are soldiers or civilians. No doubt the army's job is dealing with the war by its troops but who are the individuals of these troops and how have they been selected Regarding the mandatory military service I am seriously against it. On the other way can we compare between this mandatory and mandatory basic education and free healthcare services Which one of these aspects is going to enhance the citizens' loyalty to their country Not only that I think the mandatory military service can make the young and the old people always anxious about war instead of being optimistic and looking forward to have a secure and a happy life in the future. If any country has a well trained and well equipped army why they should mandate its people to waste their time and exhaust them in the army service I believe each country should have enough number of soldiers who are qualified trained to deal with the war professionally without imposing high schools or universities graduates to serve in the army.
