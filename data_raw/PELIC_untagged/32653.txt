I lived with my parents and siblings that you've met. I had two sisters whose I felt a close conection and an older brother. My brother who I hardly ever saw him slept on the living room couch. It was a large old couch that my father made it by himself. My best friend whose family I loved lived across the hall. We went to the same school where we studied English. Mr. Robinson who everyone was a little afraid was our English teacher. After school I worked in a bakery which my aunt and uncle owned it. They sold delicious bread and cake that people stood in line for hours to buy them. My brother and sister whose I miss live far away now. When we get together we like to talk about old days where we all lived at home then.
