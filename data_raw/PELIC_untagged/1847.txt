For me My dream vacation I will have traveled around the world that is impossible. In my country I have never traveled every city. So I am visiting Puket next year. After I finish ELI I will have gone back to Thailand. I am staying there for a week I am visiting my aunt who lives in Puket and let her takes me will have traveled the popular of Puket. I have been eaten a seafood at the restaurant near the beach my friend who has been there before told me the test are very sweet and fresh. After that day I have two days I am taking the boat to see the beautiful of Simirun Sea that is the great to everyone who have been there should do. I will have stayed and eaten on the boat I will get a good experience that I will remember in mind.
