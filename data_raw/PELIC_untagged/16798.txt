I met my friend Young when I was high school student. When I was watching our school's soccer game the rain started to fall. Unfortunately I didn't have an umbrella so I was being showered. At that time he gave his umbrella to me. While I took his umbrella he was wetting. After we became a good friend. We were studying together whenever we had a test. Now he is in army service. I miss him very much.
