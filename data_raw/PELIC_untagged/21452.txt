Hello friend As I knew that you are already registered for the next term in the ELI I wanted to share with you some things that could be useful during your permanence here. In the first place I highly recommend you to be here one month prior to the beginning of the classes in order to get familiarized with the language. About the initial test don't be nervous just prepare yourself during one or two weeks by remembering what you were taught at your hometown and do your best. Once inside the program you are going to have a lot of homework but if you have studied a major in your country you will be ok because the ELI academic charge is less than that. You should also enjoy your life here in Pittsburgh honestly it is not an exciting place but you can ask teachers and classmates what to do and where to go you can also join the activities planned by the ELI or simply let you guide by your intuition and discover places. And please remember that the U. S. Is not just for shopping you have museums shows theater and sport games. I hope my advice is useful and I wish you the best for your life here in Pittsburgh. Sincerely ANON_NAME_0.
