While I was Walking in the street two men was arguing . While one of them was shouting the other man slapped him . Then they started fighting . While they were fighting many people gathered to see . While the people were watching two of them came closer to the fighting men to calm them down . While the people were crowded a police man stopped to see what is happening . While the men was fighting they saw the police man and they stopped fighting.
