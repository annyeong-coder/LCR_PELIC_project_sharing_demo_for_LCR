My country is Libya. Libya borders Tunisia. Libya and Tunisia are located in North Africa. The population of Libya and Tunisia are 7 million. The weather is very nice most time in each country. They are Arabic but there are differences and similarities culture. I will talk about the eating habits economy and climate. At first the two countries have habits and traditions in how and where. First our foods are as spicy as Tunisia's. Tunisia's food are delicious and my country too. Recipe that shows how to prepare food is the same. Most of the people in my country eat at home but most people in Tunisia eat in restaurants. Second the people in Tunisia eat two meals a day. On the other hand my country eats three meals a day. In addition to habits and traditions I had to pay attention to the economy in each country. My country has a high level of oil. However the lowest level in Tunisia. Tourism is very high in Tunisia while it is low in my country. Tunisia dependent on tourism and the adoption of a holistic. In addition to eating habits and economy I have to point to the climate. Both countries have a nice climate. Tunisia's summer and spring season are similar to my country. At the end there are some differences between our countries but often they are similar.
