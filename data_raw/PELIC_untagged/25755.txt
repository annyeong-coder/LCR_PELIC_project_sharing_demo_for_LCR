Flow is a when a child gets totally absorbed by some activity. It is the ultimate state of creativity. I think I have experienced this kind of indulgence into an activity a long time before. Schools can incorporate sessions that allow their students to get involved in activities of their own choice. I believe that providing such a chance especially if it was accompanied by provision of all necessary equipment and material would be a great enhancement of the students' special skills and abilities.
