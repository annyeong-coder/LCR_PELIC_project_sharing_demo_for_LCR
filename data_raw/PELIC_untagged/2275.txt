Comparing my definition of Success With That of My friend Different people have different definitions of success. For instance my friend and I have different definitions of success. In my case getting fame in my job is the most important thing for success. Getting fame in my job means I become an expert in my job. I'd like to make the Korean sports industry improve and to make important decisions for it. Therefore if I get fame in the sports industry my opinion about the sports industry will be important because people think that what famous people in that field say is important. In summary I think getting fame in my job is important things for my definition of success. On the other hand my friend thinks making a lot of money is the most important thing for success. He thinks making a lot of money can help him succeed with many things like his children's education problem or his parents' health problem. For instance he says if he doesn't have enough money he can't do anything when his parents get sick unless he is a doctor. That's the reason he prefers making money. He doesn't care about fame because he doesn't think it's real. In addition even if he gets fame it can disappear easily. In sum he thinks making a lot of money is important for success. Therefore the definitions of success can be different in order to what people think.
