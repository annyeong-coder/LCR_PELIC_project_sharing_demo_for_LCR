I used to live with my parents. I used to be carefree. I didn't use to shop any food and to cook for my family every day. My mother used to do it. I used to can walk all day. I used to forget to clean my room. Now I live with my husband and I have my apartment. I have to care about my husband. I cook and clean up everything almost every day. I have to be responsible. I want to have good housekeeping skills like my mother.
