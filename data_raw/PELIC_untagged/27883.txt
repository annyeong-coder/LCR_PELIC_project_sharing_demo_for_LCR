The situation that was funny is when I got up 10 a. M on Wedensday morning I was in a hurry as I thought that there were classes at ELI. So what made me laugh was when I got there I relized that there were no classes on Wedensdays. Also I was angry at that time what made me nervous was my cloths were not ready and I had no idea that my wife washed them to make them ready for Thursday.
