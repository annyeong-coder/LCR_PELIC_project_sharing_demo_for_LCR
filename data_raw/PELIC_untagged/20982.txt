Pittsburgh is the most interesting city which I have visited. It is bigger than my city in my country and the most important in this city is Schenley Park. The Schenley Park is the most wonderful park in the Pittsburgh. It is also larger than the Southside Park. The Pittsburgh has the most beautiful university and it is the cleanest city which I have visited. It is more crowded than my city.
