Acquire initial obvious relevant target I graduated 2 months ago and my next target was to acquire my first job in my life. I called and emailed many companies but only few HR of them answered back. It is obviously hard to find a good job this year. I didn't give up. I've been keeping searching the relevant information for about 2 3 weeks. I thought that the resume was very important so I rewrote my resume as well as I could. I wrote a lot of details about my experience my hobbies and what I learned at the college. I thought people would know many things about me after they read my resume and I hope more of them will be interested. Soon I got several calls to ask me to have interviews. I made appointments with them. I was very nervous with my first interview. I was thinking too much before I met them. When they asked questions I felt I couldn't answer smoothly. However I learned from that I prepared for the next time. I felt more confident of my second one and after several times I felt more and more confident natural and stronger. Finally one company sent a letter to me which said they were very happy to let me join them. I was so glad that I acquired that position which I really love. This is my first job! Now I've worked at that company for a month and I got my initial salary this week. I am going to shopping this weekend and buy some wonderful gifts to my family and my friends to thank them for supporting me so much.
