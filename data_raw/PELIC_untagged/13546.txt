I am not an extrovert. I think I close an introvert because I enjoy thinking about something by myself. Before I came U. S. I was an extrovert. Every weekend I hung out with my friends who are my familiar. Also I went to bar which is near by my house to make friends. I liked to make new friends who made my feel comfortable. I liked to make meetings that have an all out fling with many friends but after I came U. S. My type changed to introvert. I guess I was afraid of that I met people who are American. I can not speak English very well so when I met American friends I lost confidence in oneself because they did not understand my meaning so these days I just like to meet close friends. I think I should change to extrovert.
