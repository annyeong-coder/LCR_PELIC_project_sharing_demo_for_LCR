I have been studying English at ELI for a month. I came here because I wanted to improve my English skill and learned the different culture. Before I came here I studied electrical engineering at ANON_NAME_0 Mai University. I've thought about studying abroad since I finished the school. That is why I came here for studying English and learning the different culture. I haven't attended the graduate school yet because I haven't taken the Toefl test. I will take this test in August. I will apply for the school if my score is enough.
