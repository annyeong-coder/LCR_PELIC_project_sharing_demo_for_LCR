Dear Friends! I'd like to introduce myself to you my classmates. I come from Moscow. As you know this is a capital city of Russia. Moscow is very big about 10 millions of people live there and I'm accustomed to long walking. That is why I like walking here in Pittsburgh too. I live in Shadyside and walk everyday to Pitt. Also I like traveling. I'm flying to Russia this summer to visit my family and to see my friends. Also I'm going to go to New York within a month. I have friends there and I'm missing them.
