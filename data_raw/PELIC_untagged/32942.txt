One year ago I got a phone call I couldn't answer that so I told him I will call him back when I go back my apartment. When I got home he called me again. I don't know who he is and he didn't want to tell me. I had no patient to answer but he didn't let me hang it up. He told me if I sign my name up for their credit card plan I can get some gift like a bike or a suitcase. But I don't need a bike or suitcase I turned him down. He still wanted to talk me into to join their plan and kept on talking about the advantage of the plan. I got tired and I told him I have to straighten up my room. As expected he tried to put my time off but I hang up directly. It's not polite but it's a effective way to stop him.
