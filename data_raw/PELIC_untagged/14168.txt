When I first came to Pittsburgh I thought I was confident enough to talk with the native speakers and understand them quite well. What I thought was wrong because one day I had to call to the hotel and check for the room availability and other things. After I asked her a question she told me many things and I couldn't figure out what she said but I couldn't hang up because I still needed the answer. Finally she came up with a slower speed so I could understand what she had said. After getting all the information I wanted we hung up the phone.
