I think she's a good example to follow. She was losing her hearing when she was only eight years old and was completely deaf at twelve. In spire of that she was focused in developing her abilities as a musician even though she had a disability. I like how she worked so hard to reach her goals. She wanted to become a profesional percussionist and she did it. I'm surprised how she never stoped her desire. On the contrary she wanted to do more. She designed her own unique percussion instruments.
