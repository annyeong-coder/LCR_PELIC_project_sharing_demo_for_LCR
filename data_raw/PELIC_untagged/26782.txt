I met my friend Fuse while we were studying English class in college. She was wearing a pair of beautiful earrings. I asked her after the class where she bought them but she didnot really tell me even we were talking for awhile. Time passed by we started hanging out together then one day while I was reading a magazine she came to me and gave me a little box. I was wondering why she gave me and what it was in side. She told me to open it. Once I opened it I was surprised because the beautiful earrings which I really liked were in the box.
