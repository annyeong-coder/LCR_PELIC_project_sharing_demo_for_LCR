In my opinion there are three advantages of teaching young children business skill and strategies. First teaching business skill can stimulate them thinking and creating new ideas. Second when they try to talk clients into their ideas it can help them organize their plans which can be incorporated express themselves and practice communicative skill. Finally there are added advantages such as correct money value social etiquette and suitable dressing. In addition instructors and parents should pay attention to support them and give them encouragement when they receive rejections from customers however don't make them be a utilitarianism person. In conclusion although there are many advantages in business skills adults still have to understand that children should spend more time doing other activities which they really want to do.
