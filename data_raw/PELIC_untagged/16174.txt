I agree with Charles Stangor because stereotypes main objective is to stigmatize and exploit some groups which in order enhance they way we look at our selves. I can't really see any good thing that might come from stereotypes ANON_NAME_0 believes that stereotype capture group and culture differences but he doesn't say anything about how we use and exploit these differences.
