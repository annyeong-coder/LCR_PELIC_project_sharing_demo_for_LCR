When I graduated from my collage I decided to visit Dubai . I usually visit Dubai in the summer the weather there is nice . I was very exited and happy . What make this visit very special to me is that I met one of my best friend . We always travel together but this time I surprised that he was there actually we did not plan for this meeting . When I was setting in my favorite coffee shop I saw him from the window he was walking around . I ran very fast and hugged him he was also surprised to see me . I was very happy to see him . ANON_NAME_0 is not only my friend he looks like my brother . He is intelligent smart and kind. Sometimes he calls me brother and this make me so happy.
