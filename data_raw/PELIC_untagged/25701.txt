There are many applicants are so shocked and disappointed because they have been rejected even though their resume have brilliant qualifications!! There many skills you should have to be attracted to employers beside the essential skills such as finishing at least five year college. Those skills you can't acquire them at school. They are sort of personality features. One of the most important skills is communications. It seems easy to you but in Pharmacy there are many subskills beyond communications. In addition people who are in application pool and they have been rejected because they have lack of communication. Communication is difficult in pharmacy because you have to deal with people who their education are very varied for example when you talk with a doctor you use different language that you use it with peasant. Furthermore when you demonstrate to a patient how use his medications you should use language depend on his education because it is important to understand how can administrate them not to try to show how you are good at your job because some drugs can be fatal if use it inappropriately. Anther one which I think it is fundamental too is Patience. If you are a a man who gets angry easily you have to find a carrier rather than being a pharmacist especially if you are working for high valued hospital because there are many stressful crucial moments if you behave violently it will effect negatively on your career.
