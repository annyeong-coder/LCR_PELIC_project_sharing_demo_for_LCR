Hello my name is ANON_NAME_0 Alduayji. This web page is for general knowledge about Marketing. Yes only about Marketing!. This webpage have been taking efforts time and money from me. I have lived in a small city in Saudi Arabia called Arrass. Our house was inside our farm. So every morning I had waken up early and had my breakfast. Then I had watched our cows and sheep and feed them. My life was simple and exciting. Years later we moved to the city and new chapter of my life had begun. After I had finished my bachelor degree I married and after that I went to Australia. There I had been worked on a master degree on Marketing for 2 years. Since that I have loved Marketing and read many books and literatures about it. Currently I have been working on Majmaah University since 2010. I have loved my job because they gave me the chance to pursue my PhD in the United States. By the time I arrived to Pittsburgh I had been applying for 7 schools for PhD in marketing in USA.
