I think everybody want to have family. I am lucky because I have a beatiful family. I have three children one daughter and two boys. They are my life . Some time they have very noisy and stubborn but I forget every bad thing when they smile at me. My friends told me my daughter looks like me. She is ten years old and she has blond hair. She is so smart. She is very friendly. My sons are younger than her. They think usually play game all time.
