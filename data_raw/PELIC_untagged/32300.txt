On December 12 2011 my friends and I created a time capsule. We buried it under the oldest tree in King ANON_NAME_0 Park. The capsule contains 5 items. We planned to open this capsule after 30 years. Each item tells something about the lives we live today. For example we put traditional clothing to see how much it will change. We put games video to see how much they will improve. We put music CDs to see if we still use it. We put books to see what the difference in the subjects and how they make them in future and coins to show how much they change it in that age.
