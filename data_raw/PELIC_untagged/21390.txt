The author didn't like her mother's broken English because she thought other people discriminated her mother when she need something. That burdened her with a lot of mental stress when she was young so whenever her mother spoke she winced. However she was changed and she loves her mother's broken English after she grown up. Also she realized that she use broken English too like her mother. I have a story of intimacy with her. I used to grown up country side with my grand parent and I usually spoke in dialect. After I moved to big city people were astonished when I spoke some specific words because I used dialect. At that time I was embarrassed to make people astonish. However now I like my dialect and sometimes the tone of dialect makes conversation friendly.
