In 2007 I went to Vietnam for a volunteer with the class mates. We stayed about two weeks in Ho chi Minh. We taught business to Vietnam's students in Korean in the city. The students who major in Korean are University of Vietnam. We traveled the other city. The city is Nah trang we enjoyed swimming and boat tour.
