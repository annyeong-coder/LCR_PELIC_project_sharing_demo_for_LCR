By 2001 I had already graduated University. I had been working KBS but I had been tired and depressed time after time. When I was at the age of 25 I left Korea and I was living in Italy for 1 year. On April 2003 I had been studying at Roma and finished my study. By 2004 I had already graduated master course in Italy and I had received master diploma. When I graduated I have been traveling many countries. When I returned in Korea I have been teaching music to young children. Teaching of children was more interesting than other things.
