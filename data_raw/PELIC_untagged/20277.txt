A good friend has two important qualities Being a good friend is not easy. You should have two important qualities. The first you can share secrets and keep secrets with your friend. There may something deep in your heart or there is a story that you keep to yourself. Sometimes you really want to share your emotions with someone. Now good friends are important for you. You can share your stories and emotions with them. They will hear your heart and keep your secrets. The second good friends should take care of each other. I clearly remember that I feel ill after my performance one night last year. I was far away from home my best friend ANON_NAME_0 Le brought me to the hospital and she stayed with me all night long. I was so unwell that I couldn't fell sleep so she talked with me and said many funny stories to distract me. I have been studying abroad since 2003 even though I have been far away from home for a long time we have been keeping each other in our thoughts. We often ask each other how everything is. Indeed I'm so lucky to have some good friends who trust me and care about me. I think this kind of friendship is lifelong.
