I had a funny experience once when my friend Bill sent me a strange text. Bill is one of my best friends in Pittsburgh. I think that Bill makes people laugh because his voice and texts are not clear. Also an American whose name is Jeremy is my friend. Jeremy told me that Bill was a funny person. I worried about my American friends texting and calling me because my English was terrible. Also most American people use slang. One day I received a text from Bill. He said to me If you want to go skateboarding with us hit me up. However I was not sure what the meaning of hit me up was. I thought that its meaning was to give a stimulus . Therefore I could not text Bill because I did not understand his text. After that I asked my conversation partner Do you know what 'hit me up' means My conversation partner told me that it was some kind of slang Hit me up means call me. I wondered why that means call me. And I realized that I have to study slang because slang is general language in America. After this happening I knew that slang was important in America.
