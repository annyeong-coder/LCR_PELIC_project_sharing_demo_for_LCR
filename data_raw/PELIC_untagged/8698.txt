There are a lot of experiences what I had never been experienced. One of the best regret events is a making an employee evaluation system. When I made a plan this system I wished this system would be more objective and equity. But the actual was prohibiting me from my planning. Since both the company's financial situation and the presidents' decisions were not match for my planning I couldn't practice it. I would make a planning what I was thinking if my boss refused my planning. My president wanted to treat needless employees with discrimination for the company. If I were the president I wouldn't make such a decision. Finally at this reason I should change my plane.
