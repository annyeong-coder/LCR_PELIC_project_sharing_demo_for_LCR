Dear Lan Oct 25 2006 Do you remember last time you asked me to help you to buy a watch Yesterday I went to shop. In a watch store I saw two different brands of watches that you might be like but I'm not sure which one is better for you. The one brand is Swatch watch and the other one is Citizen watch. There are some differences between Citizen and Swatch. The first difference is that Citizen is more expensive than Swatch. Citizen costs 100 but Swatch costs 70. However Citizen's warranty is longer than Swatch's. Citizen has three years warranty but Swatch only has one year warranty. Second Citizen's material is better than Swatch's because Citizen's watch was made of steel products. On the other hand Swatch's watch was made of plastic. Third Citizen's watch is lady style in contrast Swatch's watch is cuter and more colorful. So that's why I can't decide for you. If you want to see those watches please search on the internet then tell me which one you prefer. Warmly
