I think my phone often gets wrong numbers because the number is easy. I have already gotten several wrong numbers this month. One day a phone call woke me up early in the morning. I thought it was my friend or my family so I picked it up. The voice said to me Hey ANON_NAME_0! And kept on talking to me. I said to her You have a wrong number. She figured out after a while and gave up talking. She just hung up. I know anyone can make a mistake but in early morning or late night I hope that the wrong number never comes up again.
