Graduation is next month! I need to make some plan now because when exams start I don't have any free time. What am I going to do when I finish school My roommate is going to take a vacation before she iooks for a job. I can't do that because I need to earn some money soon. I will think that after I graduate I am going to take a word processing class. As soon as I learn word processing I will look for a job as a bilingual office assistant. It'll be hard to find full time job though part time jobs are easier to find. Maybe I take a part time job after I find a good full time one. Or maybe I will take a workshop in making decisions before I do anything
