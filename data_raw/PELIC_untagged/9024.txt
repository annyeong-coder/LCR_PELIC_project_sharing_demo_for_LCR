When I applied to an university I should have chosen the major I like. I must ride a motocycle to my college for 1 hour and my parents said You could have rented an apartment near your college. I should not have spent a lot of time doing a part time job. I should have studied hard. I should not have stopped studying English I ought to have chosen some English class in my college. My parents said You could have done more exercises. I should not have given up playing tennis and basketball. When I graduated from college I should have found a job. I should not have stayed at home all day.
