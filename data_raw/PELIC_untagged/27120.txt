To live in the USA is an interesting experience. From my first days I was impressed by the differences of the food sport and customs. First before I went here I had never seen so much fast food. Indeed in France I had just eaten in Mac Donald's and in Quick. I had tried their sandwiches their fritters of chicken and I had drunk their various soft drinks. However I didn't know ANON_NAME_0's Subway. . . Now that I tried I can confirm that I do not really like fast food. I only like eating their ices creams. On the other hand I did not know bagels I had not tasted it before my arrival Pittsburgh and I find that delicious. Then I had never imagined that the Americans did so much sports. But every weekend most of the Americans like practising jogging. Of the time when I was in France I had not gone to a weights room because it was very expensive. In Pittsburgh with my Pitt ID I have a free access to fitness rooms machines of body building and swimming pools! Finally the customs are also very different. In France when I arrived in the morning I made the kiss to all the persons in the room to say hello to them. It is not practised in the USA. Another habit is that in France after an invitation to dine I had never sent an email of thanks. In the USA I pay attention to respect this habits.
