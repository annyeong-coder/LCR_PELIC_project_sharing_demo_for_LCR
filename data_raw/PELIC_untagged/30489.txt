I had cleaned my house before I came to Pittsburgh. I had covered my furniture before I came to Pittsburgh to keep it clean. I had sold my car before I came to Pittsburgh. I had visited my family and friends before I came to Pittsburgh. I had bought a ticket for my trip before I came to Pittsburgh.
