I was on holiday at the sea side in Corsica a mediterranean island. It was a long time ago I was only a child but this accident will be impressed in my mind forever. We were at the beach during a sunny summer morning. One of my father's friends used to do dive fishing. That morning as almost every day he left the beach by swimm to reach a group of rocks that were placed few metres from the shore. While he was fishing the weather changed quickly probably he had been forgotten to watch the forecast that day. Within five minutes the sea become choppy and he sheltered himself on a rock. He was not able to swimm back to the beach because the waves were too higth! As the danger was realised the harbour office was informed. A rubber arrived in some minutes but there was too much wind and it wasn't able to get closer the rock so my father's friend has not been saved. Finally after a long wait he has been taken up by an helicopter! I still clearly remember when he has been tied up and has been heaved on the helicopter!
