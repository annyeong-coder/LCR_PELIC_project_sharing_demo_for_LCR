If I must go to a desert island for five weeks I might take knife matches and a pen and paper. I thank that I can use knife to cut cactuses and get some water from it and then I may use matches to have a campfire at night. A desert island ought to be a special place to me I should take a pen and paper to paint or write down an essay there.
