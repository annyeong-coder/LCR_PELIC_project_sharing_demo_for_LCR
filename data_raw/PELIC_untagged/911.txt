Should schools need to limit student's computer lab time I agree that some schools limit student's computer labs time to prevent them from Webaholism. The internet is a very popular communication tool in the modern time. Many young people use it to make new friends search for new information and do homework. It is convenient for people to save much time and money. On the other hand many people waste much time on the internet to do useless things. For example some students spend much time on playing on line games and forget to do their homework. In addition they have many problems in psychologic and mental. They can't make friends in real world and don't care about their family anymore. Some medical research reports said if you use computer for a long time you must take a rest every 30 mins or you will get heart attach or other diseases but most people don't ignore this. Thus Schools are educational places. They need to push students to do right things and direct them to do useful activities. They can't spend too much time on the internet if it's not necessary. Therefore school should limit student's computer labs times. Students also realize that the internet just a kind of tool and not your whole life. They must go outside and reaction with friends and family in real world. They will have healthier psychology and mind.
