Illiteracy Stills a Big Problem The world is still facing the problem of illiteracy. Illiteracy according to The United Nations definition is the inability to read and write a simple sentence in any language . There is a terrifying fact says indicates to a huge number of children who don't go to schools. That means illiteracy will be increased. Therefore these children need international efforts to protect them from this serious problem. However who wants to solve this problem must know what the causes of this problem are. Most of the studies say that the most crucial cause of illiteracy is poverty. In fact poverty does not exist only in poor countries which are mostly located in Africa and Asia. It also exists in some other countries. In poor countries governments often can not provide schools for all children. This means that millions of children will grow up with out knowing how to read or write. Also a lot of poor people are not interested in teaching their children because they can not fund them or they get them to work. Therefore the large numbers of illiterates will be continuous as long as poverty exists. In addition poverty affects a lot of people whether they live in rich countries. That is because some countries do not care about poor people who live in remote areas. Studying is not an obligatory in all countries. Consequently poverty causes illiteracy. Unfortunately United Nation can not solve this problem. At least there are no statistics that indicate any solution. In summary poverty is the main cause of this problem. Whenever the world decreases poverty illiteracy logically will decrease.
