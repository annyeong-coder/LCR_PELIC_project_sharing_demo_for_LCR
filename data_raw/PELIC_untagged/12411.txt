Do sports stars earn ridiculously large salaries Who has the largest income in the sports field Kobe Bryant or Tiger Woods Many people say that those sports stars earn ridiculously large salaries. Why Are they the richest man in the world Definitely they are not. How about some entertainment stars How about some owners of monopolizations Some of them are much richer than sports stars. Do all of them should be blamed In my opinion those sports stars deserve their salaries. First different from entertainment stars or the successors of monopolizations every sport stars became famous through hard work. One can be born with beautiful face or be born with millions of dollars. However you won't become an outstanding sports star unless you are trained hardly. Some of those training are horrible to ordinary people. Because of this reason I think sports stars should be paid highly. Second sports stars are paid highly because their bosses are willing to pay them. Today is a commercial society. People go to work everyday and get payment from their bosses. Why boss pays you The answer is simple. Only if you can earn more money than your salary your boss will pay you. Sports stars get much money from their bosses for the reason that they can earn more money for them. So don't say such thing like that sports stars earn ridiculously large salaries. If you can earn as much as those sports stars earn for their bosses you also deserve that ridiculously large salary. As all above said I don't think sports stars earn ridiculously large salaries. Those ridiculously large salaries are ready for anyone who deserves it. If you can go and get it.
