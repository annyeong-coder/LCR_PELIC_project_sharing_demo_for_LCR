The brown house located in Northumberland Street is my apartment. My apartment is a small and neat place. There is a slightly size kitchen. I always cook in the kitchen that doesn't have enough space. The capacity of the kitchen has only one person seating. When I cook something with my roommate in the kitchen we always move very close. We own small place by ourselves even though the kitchen is so small. We always help together because it spends a lot of time to clean up. We buy some equipment to put in the kitchen but we can find out easily. We always arrange for trash and waste to put on the specific situation. Although my apartment only have a little bit space we keep clear and had food and tools sufficient for we needs. The characteristics of the apartment are our love as family.
