Finding an apartment sounds easy but in my experience it's a very hard process. I may study for 2 years in Pittsburgh so I will look for an apartment which can be almost perfect for me. My ideal apartment must be near to my University the room must be bright and clean and it can't be very expensive. Most students live in the University area and I also want to find an apartment there. There are many advantage to live near to the University. For example there are many place offering me to study such as library cafeteria or classroom. I can often attend some activities in the school even in the evening. I may invite some classmate to my apartment to have a party and don't worry about being late to go home. However finding an apartment near to the University is very important for me. I want to live in an apartment which has big windows so that my room can be very bright. I hope there is enough sunshine though my window. I don't like a room in an old hours it doesn't look very clean and nice so I may locate a related new apartment. The Price is also important. I hope the rent is between 300 to 400 dollars totally. Because I can't offer much money it must be difficult to find an ideal apartment. If not I can only reduce my requirement. I really hope I can successfully find a bright clean and cheap apartment near to the University. That will be great!
