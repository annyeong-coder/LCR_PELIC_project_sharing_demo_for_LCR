My family is considered a peaceful family by the neighbors since we always look harmonious. The most important person who makes us peaceful is my Uncle Dongsung. He looks chubby but he tries not to eat too much. He has got a bald and big head but is not ashamed of them. Honestly his nickname was pig when he was young. Though He has god kind of a funny appearance He is happy to make us laugh. When he was a little boy he lost his father. He couldn't get love and protection from his father. I guess that is why he leaded astray himself. However he has come back to right way soon because of his family. He knows how painful it is for family to live without an important member. That is the reason why he is glad to make us happy. I am sure that he is one of the most valuable person in my family. I hope we'll stay together in the same village as long as we can.
