My favorite place to eat lunch in Oakland is Oishii. One of the reasons that I like there is I can eat Korean food like bibimbab. Also there is a lot of Korean food that I like. After I came here I couldn't eat Korean food well Oishii can make me eat Korean food. And another reason is that the boss and uncle in Oishii are very kind. When I went to Oishii the boss gave me a drink for free. And uncle asked me If you want I can give you some Korean food for free. And Oishii has enough place to eat something. It has also second floor. So I can choose place to eat first floor or second floor. It's good to have many options. So Oishii is my best place to eat lunch in Oakland.
