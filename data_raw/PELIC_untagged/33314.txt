I had never stayed with something I hate before I stayed with a local family in Germany. It happened when I was 15. As soon as I entered the room of my host family two hideous snakes in water tank came into my sight. I was so angry because I had told the homestay organization that I was scared of snakes before. I felt exceptionally puzzled why my host family did such a rude thing to a foreign girl The fear of snake and the bad impression of the host family kept me away from them. I spent most of time staying in my room and using facetime to chat with my mom. My mom told me that I should give others a chance to explain and try to solve the problem together. I was surprised after talking with my host family they confessed that the snake matter was an accident because the organizers overlooked the pet issue. They didn't know that I was scared of snakes. They sent their pets to the neighbors and our relationship has been improved. This experience taught me that we can't simply judge a person by first impression. It is like playing magic cube where if you concentrate on a single square you would never have made it. Also we should try to communicate and solve problem together when we have trouble instead of keeping quiet.
