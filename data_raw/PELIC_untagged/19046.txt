My good friend in Israel helped me learn about my new work. Some times she let me to make mistakes after that I have explenation to our big boss about that. Usually that mistakes make me learn and be better next time. Sometimes I had anger about that way to study. Today far away in my free time I get my mind to think about past and to take important things from past period of my life. Educating my children I make them learn about their mistakes. Me and my husband let them proceed at their own pace about their study. The children help me to take care about house keeping I make them learn faster.
