When I was 22 years old I was on a vacation. I had planed to take a trip with my friends before my father suggested me to take a trip with my family. I should have decided to take a trip with who I go. It was really difficult for me to decide it. So I compared the trip with my friends with the trip with my family. Finally I decided to take a trip with my family. There are three reasons of my decision including importance of my family opportunity cost and saving money.
