Nowadays we face many strange phenomenon changing time of season's start and end fall heavy rain or snow we couldn't expect. Scientists said those strange phenomenon are coming from global warming. The carbon dioxide in atmosphere from people is getting more and more. From ABC news Carbon dioxide emissions were 35 percent higher in 2006 than in 1990 . That affects to people while they don't know. But it causes serious problems like flood from heavy rain or ice burg saperated from arctic. That phenomenon that rained at concentrated range from people's fault hurts people in many ways. First the flood takes away people's lives who have lived in normal at a moment. Some people lost their family. And some people lost their house. They also can't work. They are just depressed with their dream. When I was a soldier in Korea I went to help people who lost their house and farms from flood. I can't forget their face that they look out of it. Second the government is affected from that disaster. The government needs a lot of budget to care their citizen in the panic. And the economic problems are also caused. For example a few years ago a huge flood makes the Florida a hell. So the U. S. Government needs much money and effort to recover. So the government also needs a policy to prevent that problem. Third nature is destroyed too. The ecosystem might be influenced from that disaster. The river got flood the trees was broken. It needs 20 30 years to recover completely. And circumstance is going to go bad with much harmful virus and insects. At the end the flood from people's fault makes many problems to people. The prevention is the best way to solve this problem. We have to stop making bad surroundings to people. Researchers led by Josep G. Canadell of Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization.
