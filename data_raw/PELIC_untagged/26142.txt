After graduating from college I'm going to get a master degree in Business Administration. I will apply to a graduate school in the U. S. To study the MBA next year. Starting study in U. S. Need some requirements like TOEFL and GMAT. Getting a high score in TOEFL test is my first goal this year. Before taking TOEFL test I should prepare for this exam by studying English at ELI. Having Studied English at ELI my English has improved. After taking TOEFL test I will prepare to take a GMAT test which is my second goal. Next year I hope to start my master degree. I'm looking to finish my master degree and go back to my home country to start work. Getting a job is the main goal in my life to be able to get married and have a family. Finally studying in the U. S. My life will be better and I will have good future.
