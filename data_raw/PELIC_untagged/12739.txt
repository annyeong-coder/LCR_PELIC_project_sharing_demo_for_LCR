I have a friend who lives in Pittsburgh since when I had five years old. His Mother is from Chicago a nice city which is located in the Midwest of the United States. She is very kind with me especially when she notices that I am sad or missing my family. The name of my friend is Charles but all of us call him Chuck . He is a very good soccer player and he practices every evening in the field which is located three blocks behind his house. He loves play guitar and he practices his guitar lesson in his room which is in the second floor and where he spent two hours every day try on it every day. Two years ago he visited my country where he stayed for one week with my family. In this time he convinced me to visit him and to study some English. For this reason I am here.
