I always straighten up my room. It is cheers me up. When I go out from school and then come back home first I turn on my music player. Then I m cooking for dinner. If run out my refrigerator I will bring down. Next I sit down on my chair. Then I will check out my homework. If I complete the steps it will makes up happiness to me.
