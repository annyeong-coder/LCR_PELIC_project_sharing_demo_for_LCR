The best meal I have recently had was one month ago. I went to Niagara Falls with my husband. We had a reservation for dinner at 'the KEG' steakhouse bar in Embassy suites hotel because it has a nice view. We sat seats next to the widow and can see Niagara Falls through the window. It was a great view!! I ordered classic steak set and my husband ordered lobster and steak set. He also ordered red wine receiving waitress's help. The waitress was very kind and she gave us good advice. First a roll of bread had been served. It was hot and hot and was so delicious. And Caesar salad had been come. It is also satisfying. And then the main menus were served. I had a piece of sirloin steak and a baked potato and vegetables including small size's mushroom and asparagus. And my husband had steak potato lobster and a piece of boiled tomato. Although lobster was not big it is very good. And he enjoyed a grass of red wine. I just tasted a sip of wine because I was pregnant. To memorize the travel and the dinner I and husband took pictures of the restaurant and food that we had have. The mood view and food of the restaurant were all good. It was very pleasant diner that I have had.
