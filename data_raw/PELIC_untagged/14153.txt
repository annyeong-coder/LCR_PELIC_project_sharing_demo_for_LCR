The most exciting thing that has happened to me in Pittsburgh is I went to Kennywood with my friends at night. That was the first time to go to amusement at night. We went there at night because there was an activity about Halloween. At the end of September and the whole October Kennywood has hunting houses at night. When we went into the hunting houses there were a lot of people pretended as ghosts. Not only in the hunting house but also in the park you can see many ghosts walking in the park anywhere. We also play the roller coaster. It was the most exciting thing. Because I can see anything at night you don't know what will happen. It was really exciting. I recommend to go to Kennywood at the night!
