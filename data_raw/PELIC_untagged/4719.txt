When I saw my new boss for the first time I was working in my office. He was a busy man and he was walking around my department. So I missed the chance to introduce myself but I did so at a later conference. He always gave us appropriate advice when we had touble. My new boss suggested going abroad and introduced me to the laboratory of UPMC. So I am here in Pittsuburgh and that's why he is an important person for me.
