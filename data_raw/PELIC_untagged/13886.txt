When I first wrote an essay about live in Pittsburgh. I spent almost three hours to figure out what is the best topic sentence then I come up with a comparison between Thai food in Pittsburgh and my home town. After I got the topic sentence I talked my friend into having dinner at Thai restaurant next day. She didn't go along with me. She told me that I should go over my prewriting and then just wrote down my essay.
