When I arrived at Pittsburgh at this September I wanted to visit some places. I have visited Phipps conservatory. Looking plants is my hobby and I really enjoyed there. I have also visited Carnegie Museum because I like dinosaurs. The display of dinosaurs was wonderful. I want to visit both places again. I wanted to go to Niagara Falls but I haven't gone there. Because I and my husband have been busy for starting new life at Pittsburgh we couldn't take enough time to go to a remote place. My husband's mother and brother will visit the U. S. A this weekend so we are planning to go to Niagara Falls with them.
