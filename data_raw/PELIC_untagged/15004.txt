I leave in big apartment with my friend and it very comfortable . In our apartment we had 2 rooms and small kitchen in addition we have one living room . My room is the biggest one I have a big and comfortable bed in front of it there is a small TV . On the right of it there are two chairs . Over the chairs there is a picture of my city. There is a big dress at the end of room . In the living room there is a Moroccan living . In the middle of it there is a old table I bought it from Mexico. And what is specially that is traditional room . Finally our apartment is the place where I spend all my time and like it to much .
