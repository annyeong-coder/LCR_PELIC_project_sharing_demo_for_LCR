When I'm thirty I will marry someone who sadly I still don't know If I come back to Pittsburgh I will visit all my friends. Unless the end of the world comes I'll be in Venezuela next December. In case I die in Pittsburgh ANON_NAME_0 will call my mom to tell her the tragic news. Because I'm smart I will get a scholarship to do a master degree in Europe. After I finish my master degree I will travel around the world during two years and may be more. As soon as arrive in Venezuela I will eat a delicious barbecue with arepas and palmita cheese. Once I meet my soul mate I will make sure he is not a murder. Before I die I will be sure to do everything I dreamed. Although all these sentences are wishes I'll get every single wish I wrote unless in my dreams . Jaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaajajjajajajaja
