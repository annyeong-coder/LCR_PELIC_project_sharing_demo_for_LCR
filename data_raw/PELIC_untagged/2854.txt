Topic Special Course of Military Most men of Korea must go to the Army Service because Korea continues war. But some people can choice his military course. For example some guys enter the government office like a village office and other guys replace to work in the company that is appointed government. In my case I chose the R. O. T. C. When I was sophomore in the university I registered the R. O. T. C. It's a special military group. While I was student of university I had to study to major and military science. Also I had to train with my co worker. It was very hard we had to know about soldier during the office's candidate. Sometime we went to the party after school and drink a lot of alcohol. Anyway we graduated the university we went to the Army as officer. At that time we can know about rank soldier and war. It was good for me because I could know good information about human relation. Also we could get a lot of money while we were officer.
