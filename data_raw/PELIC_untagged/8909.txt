The first sticker is very interesting in the fact that if I were illiterate I couldn't read the sticker. In other words what this mean is that if I am literate I won't honk. For the second sticker that a wife doesn't show how much money she will pay for her husband is what's funny about this. What the humor depends on is the fact that the dog is worthier than the husband. For the sixth sticker what this is about is everyone agrees with my opinion. That I am the big boss is what this is referring to.
