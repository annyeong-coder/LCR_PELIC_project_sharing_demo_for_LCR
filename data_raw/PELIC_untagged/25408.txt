In my opinion and observation the birth order affect an individual's personality. We Turks always say that 1st child is generally more calm neat stable and adaptable than the other kids. Firstly parents behave the first child as a only child then when the second comes they want him her to be the older. Even if that course of action makes the first child confused he she gets used to handle it and stay calm. Second ones are more nervous quick tempered and impatient than the older one. Sometimes those properties cause adjustment disorder as well. Because they can't join the older ones games or activities because of being younger. At the same time they can't join the youngest one's activities because of being older and they feel that they serve them as a model. It is considered that the middle ones are the unfortunate ones. The little ones attitude can be different. Sometimes fearful and crabby sometimes hard working and contentious than others to show them how strong they are.
