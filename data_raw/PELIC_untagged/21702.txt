The worst meal experience I have ever had happened about seven years ago. My wife and I went to a high class restaurant my wife oredered well known meal to us in Saudi Arabia and that was easy one for her and she liked it. While my self I oredered a strainge meal just to try something different. The servant was english speaker and my english that time was not enough to talk to the servant and ask him about the meal. My wife's meal came first while mine I was waiting for it a long time and I was starving. Finally the meal is ready and he put the plate on the table infront of me. It was very small meal and even was not enough for a kid. The problem also it was really expensive meal and I decided to go to another restuarant.
