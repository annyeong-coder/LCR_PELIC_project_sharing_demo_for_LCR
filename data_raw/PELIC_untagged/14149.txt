ELI is a good place to study English language. Teachers are very professional and friendly! Before ELI I was in other English school but teachers' qualification in ELI is much more higher they even cannot be compared. I like ELI very much! Says ANON_NAME_0. Study in ELI presents possibility for further professional development. I learned English at ELI at all levels from 3 to 5. It allows me to receive better job. Declared Alex ANON_NAME_1. Students do not only study English they are involved in various activities. From fall 2007 to fall 2008 the number of activities in ELI increased in about two times from 13 to 25. Good example for it is a resent visit to Heinz Hall for symphony. I like classical music and I enjoyed the symphony very much. Thank you ELI! Says German Kolmakov.
