Prayer in Islam ident Prayer in our life as Muslims is very important issue. We can't ignore it in any time or at in any place when it's time to do it. In this piece of paper I am going to explain what does prayer mean in our religion and when do we perform it Prayer in our life it means a lot of things I really can't mention it in this small paragraph however I will just indicate a basic definition for it. Prayer is especial performance made it by a person to connect with Allah. The prayer is composed of some movement praise and asking from Allah for any thing that you want. Also we must face toward the Ka'abah where is located in Maccah. At least we must pray five times a day. It is called Fajr Zuher Asr Magreb and Isha. Each on of them has specific time to perform. First Fajr prayer which begins from dawn until sunrise. Second Zuher prayer which begins after ten minutes from the noon until a shade for anything becomes longer that thing two times. Third Ase prayer starts when a shade for anything become longer that thing two times until before approximately 15 minutes the sunset. Fourth Magreb prayer which its onset starts after the sunset until twilight disappeared. Fifth Isha prayer that comes after the twilight disappeared until midnight. Any Muslim has to pray each prayer during its time unless he can't pray it for really true reason however he must do it as soon as he possible. That brief explanation about our prayer what does it mean and when we have to pray it.
