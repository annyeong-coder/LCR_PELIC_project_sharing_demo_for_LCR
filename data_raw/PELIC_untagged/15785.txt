I would like to write about my grandmother who is 88 years old. She is still healthy and active in spite of her age. She has lived alone since her husband my grandfather passed away 30 years ago. When I was a child I use to visit her house every summer vacation. Her life style was very interesting to me. She waked up early morning went to a field by bicycle cultivated the soil and planted many kinds of vegetables and fruits. I had good experiences and talked with her about her old memory while helping her at the field. She sometimes said to me Without my marriage with my husband I would not have felt happy. Had we gotten married you would not been here. She suggested that I obey and follow my husband in the future. She had very old fashioned concept. I used to enjoy listening to her obsolete thought.
