DIFFICULTIES OF THE FIRST CHALLENGER If you are the first person who gets a higher education in your family this is going to be a little bit tough for you. I am an examlple for this situation I am the only one who has a diploma in my family my mom and dad are not very well educated so they admire people educated around them and this fact made me try more because my high education was so important for them. I have an older sister but she didn't study in university not because she didn't have opportunity that was her choice and now she works for a make up company . I am a civil engineer I graduated from one of the best engineering schools in my country. Of course it was really hard to achieve this goal because since you have nobody to show you the way it takes more time and effort than the others. Moreover your parents expect you to have a good job and a better life they work and pay for you just to see that you have a good education which they have always wanted but couldn't have and this circumstance makes you feel responsible for not only yourself and also for them. I have a younger brother who is 10 years old and I think he is luckier than me because he is going to have an experienced brother during his education life.
