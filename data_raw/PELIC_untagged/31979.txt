On October 10 2011 my children and I created a time capsule. We buried it under the oldest bed in my house. The capsule contains 9 items. Each item tells something about the life we live today. For example toy car a picture of grandfather some fabrics made out of cotton some books some tools two games three cameras some jewelry of my family and six nail scissors. There is still a lot to learn from this time capsul called the hardware of my family .
