I my driving license tow months ago. I had been so afraid before I first drove a car. However when I tried it I realized it was so easy and fun. My father had been teaching me how to drive everyday before I got my license. Obtaining a driving license was something special to me and I had determined to succeed in the driving test. My family had been worried about me because I was too excited about it.
