Oct 19 06 Dear Hadi Two days ago I have received money of my father. Hopefully I am going to buy a car this month but I am not sure which kind of car that is very suitable for me. In addition I am confused between two cars that I am very satisfied about them which are Honda Accord and Ford Victoria. In my opinion I prefer to buy Honda Accord than Ford Victoria because there are so many reasons to that. First of all Honda has a stronger engine than Ford. Secondly Honda its shape looks better than Ford. Thirdly Honda is very constant in the road but Ford is not. Fourth Honda is very smaller than Ford so it is easy to park it any where. Lastly Honda costs 28 000 on the other hand Ford costs 20 000. Therefore I am very confused because Honda costs more than Ford. In conclusion you read what I wrote to you so my friend really I need your help with that because you are only the one who I trust his answer. Furthermore you have experienced to cars so you will help me a lot with that. After all I hope that you write back to me with your opinion about the most suitable one for me. Best wishes
