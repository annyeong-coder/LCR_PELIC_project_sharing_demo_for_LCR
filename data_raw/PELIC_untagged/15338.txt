I have a friend who lives in Japan. She is a colleague that works as a nurse in a hospital. She is the most interesting person that I have ever met. She is working at a hospital in which I had worked before. She has a daughter whose name is Ayane. Also She has another daughter whose name is Kotone. Her family lives in Komaki city that is located in the middle of Japan. We are good friends.
