I will describe about my life in next year For a year next September I will be happy looking back all accomplishments that I have achieved. Futhermore I will be buoyant and optimistic with expectation about the future. I shall be enjoying lots of exciting experiences that I have dreamed and delayed for a long time. First of all I will have already finished my first semester at one of famous Fashion Schools in New York. In addition I will have been studying the second semester which will be actually the last semester because the course I will apply for is a year long curriculum. During next summer vacation I shall have already finished my intern at that time in one of the luxury companies that I have aimed for. Also I will be offered a regular job from the company with excellent benefits. I believe it will be the best and proudest moment in my life at next year September. Thinking of and visualizing all the accomplishments I can hardly wait to face next year! I only hope that I will not be distracted by negative thoughts or energy. However what is crucial for me at this moment is that I should get up earlier every morning because it keeps me from using time wisely. Thank you!
