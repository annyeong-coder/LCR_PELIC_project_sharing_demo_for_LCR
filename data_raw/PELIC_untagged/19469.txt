I will write in this paragraph about the most important relationship I did. As all know after completing the high school a person will look for his future such as looking for a university even if it in different city or some will go further and study in different country. Therefore in the university a student will make a new relationship and it usually last for more time. Here I will talk about my friend Tamim. I remembered when I was in the university. While I was smoking one guy came to me and asked me for a lighter and I gave him. After that we began a discussion and we started the discussion talking about different subject. Then I asked him about his name after that I realized that I know his cousin. Then after this discussion our relationship started and he is still my closest friend. Also I cannot forget many things he has done it to me. For example while I was driving to the collage and driving my brother's car I did an accident. At this time I don't have the money to fix the car also I didn't tell my brother about the accident and what happed to his car. When Tamim heard about the story he brought to the money and then I asked from where you got this money and he told me I borrowed it from my father. At the end the car was fixed and I returned to Tamim his money.
