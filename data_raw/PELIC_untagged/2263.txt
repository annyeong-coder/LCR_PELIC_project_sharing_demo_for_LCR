Welcome to my homepage. I'm ANON_NAME_0. I've been living in Pittsburgh for six months. I came here to study English so now I'm studying in PITT. I built this webpage to show my pictures. I really like to take pictures so I've taken more than 500 pictures in Pittsburgh. I've posted some pictures about making film. I took these pictures in Massachusetts. I went to there to help my friends to make film. It was really exciting experience for me. Before I came to Pittsburgh I didn't know how to take a picture. Now I can use camera because I've learned from them. I hope you enjoy my pictures.
