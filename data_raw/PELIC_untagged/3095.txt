The bedouins customs 2 27 2007 The Bedouins have their own special customs and tradition. First they have special foods. Their food is 'Kabsihe'. It is rice with meat. For example lamb and camel. It is very delicious. They eat it in the lunch and in the dinner. Second the Bedouins have special drinks. They drink camel's milk Arabic coffee and tea. They always drink it any time. When you drink the camel milk you will become healthy because there is calcium energy in the camel. I like it and I like their customs and their tradition because there are positive things in their customs. For example there are camel milk and 'Kabsah'. It is positive things for our body because there are calcium in the milk and end energy in the 'Kabsihe' for that we need it. I always learn a good thing from them. For example ride a camel. I think it is a good culture.
