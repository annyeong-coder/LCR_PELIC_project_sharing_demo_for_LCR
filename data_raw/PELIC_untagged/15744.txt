It's always hard for me to figure out English speakers and especially a conversation on the phone with them gives me big frustration. Three weeks ago I had got to call my apartment manager to move from two bedrooms to one bedroom although I already contracted two bedrooms till this December. During calling I was confused whether I can move or not. I couldn't distinguish 'can' from 'can't'. So I kept on asking the manager to repeat. Although she tried to speak slowly for me I was too nervous to make it out at all. After I said to her I have my husband call back to you sorry I couldn't help hanging up. After hanging up I thought how long on earth I had to count on my husband for. I was cheered up and I called back her. I had an appointment to meet her in her office. Finally I met her and asked if it was allowed to move without any penalty. However that was not the end. I also had difficulty to go on a conversation with her. In the end I asked for her to e mail me in order to clear up the conversation because I worried if there were some misunderstandings in our conversation. She kindly e mailed me and I could totally figure out that the moving was not impossible.
