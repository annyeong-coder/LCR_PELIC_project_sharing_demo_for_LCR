Popular means everybody likes you and wants to be around you famous only means well known. For example George W Bush is famous but not popular. David Beckham is famous and popular. Common has almost same meaning like popular but common is used when something shared by or belonging to two or more people. For instance we can say David Beckham is popular for me. However we can not say David Beckham is common for me.
