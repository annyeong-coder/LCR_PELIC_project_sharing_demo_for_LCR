I agree with a part of Stanger's view about the effect of stereotypes. According to his view people employ stereotypes mainly to simplify how they think about others and to enhance their views of themselves and the groups to which they belong Stereotypes help people to clarify what others are and what kind of national characters they have. Moreover stereotypes can be based on our perspectives on others. Without objectivity or neutrality a useful generalization about other people would become a harmful stereotype. For example when you meet a Japanese guy who do not smoke and drink any alcoholics you think Japanese do not smoke and drink alcoholics. However it is wrong that you generalize Japanese by means of observing the only one person subjectively. In order to knowledge the useful generalization about other people you should draw the conclusion both by seeing hearing studying observing others as much as possible and by adequate proper and objective information.
