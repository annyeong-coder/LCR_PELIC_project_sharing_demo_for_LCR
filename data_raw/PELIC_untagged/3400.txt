Houses in Pittsburgh Riyadh indent Houses in Pittsburgh are completely different from Riyadh where I live. In other words there isn't any similarity between them except the word houses . The more primary differences between the houses in these two cities are shape size and privacy. Houses shapes in Pittsburgh are very simple and humble. Moreover the houses resemble each other. Sometimes I can't distinguish between them. Also I don't see any embellishment on out houses body. On the contrary houses in Riyadh have variety of shapes. In addition most of them have embellishments on it. Many houses have been built in sophisticated way. Beside that houses in Riyadh have torrent of colors. Size of houses in Pittsburgh is smaller than in Riyadh. In general I noticed that each house in Pittsburgh doesn't have more than three or four rooms. In addition rooms are very small specially bedrooms. Therefore houses in Pittsburgh don't have large spaces. Compared with Pittsburgh most houses in Riyadh are composed of at least medium or large four rooms. Thus those need enough spaces to establish rooms and other parts of house. Most houses in Pittsburgh have open back or front yard and some of them have both. Similarly most houses in Riyadh do however those have more privacy by tall walls around their yards. Unlike in Pittsburgh houses in Riyadh separated from each other by tall walls. Therefore no body can share people or see them when they in their houses without permission. Shape Size and privacy are three big differences between houses in Pittsburgh and Riyadh. Consequently I have a challenge to adapt with houses in Pittsburgh.
