One time when my family and I were meeting at my parent's home. My nephew used my computer and erased some important document . At that time I felt nervous and I hit him strongly. Then I felt regret because he was child and I shouldn't have hurt him. Also his mother was upset but she might have teached him to not touch people's stuff. In the beginning I pretended I didn't see him and it was a mistake. I ought to have warned him when he touched my computer. But I really was worried about my sister. Should I have told her first Or I could at least have deprived something from him instead of hitting. Finally I shouldn't have punished him and I should never have used this way in warning the children.
