In the sports game winning or losing might be important however how to get to the issue will be more important. In the Johntel's story he should have been on the pre game roster but he couldn't because of his mother's death. His coach however was willing to take a technical foul lying down for his playing. Also the other team showed sportsmanship with respecting the decision of referees to keep the rule but missing the two free throws on purpose even though the game was tight. They all made a wise decision and made it beyond a sports game.
