Sara is my best friend. Three years ago both of us applied for the same job and the same day for interview was assigned for us. I still remember that day when I first met her. While I was preparing my presentation she was reading a book. I faced a technical problem and she came to help me. She solved the problem by deleting a program from the laptop. I thanked her so much and she served me a cup of coffee. When I finished the interview she was preparing herself. She was so panic and I tried to calm her down . I got the result that I was accepted for the job. On my first day at work I saw her we were the only new members in the department. I told her you owe me a cup of coffee which we had in the canteen. Since that time we are so close to each other. She is the most important person in my life because she is a very helpful kind and supportive person. We share the same interests and our opinions are usually the same.
