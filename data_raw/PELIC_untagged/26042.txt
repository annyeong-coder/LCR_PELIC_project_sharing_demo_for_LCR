Dear Mr. ANON_NAME_0 I am a student at the EFL Computer Training Institute. My classes are very good but the Institute had better make some improvements or many students are going to leave. First I think you should clean the computer lab. Then you shouldn't allow people to eat or drink in the computer lab. Also you ought to have more computers in the lab. Similarly you should repair the copy machine and the window. Finally you should also repair the lighting. Yours Truly Zamla
