Each person defines the meaning of friends in different ways. Many people say that a friend is someone who has known them for a long time and whose interests are the same as their. But others say that a friend should be someone who listens to their problems and cries with them. What is the exact definition of friends For me I don't have the exact definition of friends. Who should be a friend an acquaintance or a buddy depends on my feelings. Now I have two best friends who live in Thailand. One of them has been my best friend since I was in the fourth grade. She is the one who always gives me advice when I'm in trouble and I always consult her when I have problems which bother me. I met the other friend when I was a freshman. She had been my roommate until the end of the first year. She became my roommate again when I was a senior. In that year we knew each other very well because we spent all of the time together. She is the one who accepts the way I am. I always tell her my thoughts and feelings. In my opinion the number of friends is not important. Actually I'm very surprised that how lucky I am to have two best friends.
