Teenagers are the majority group of the population in my country Saudi Arabia. Teenager's stage is critical one in every life because they are the basic statement of any countries. First they do many things that are unacceptable. For example their behaviors and characteristics sometimes are against their culture. They aren't interested in the routine customs and traditional things. So they try to do many abnormal things. For example they like to drive through crazy way and they do that sometimes without driver licenses. However they are smarting and usually try to show up themselves. But unfortunately they do that through some wrong activities like smoking cigarettes that are only to let their parents know how they are able to change the rules. One of the worst behaviors is the irresponsibility. For instance they are driving fast and cross the rod with red sign traffic. They always don't listen to the advice of their parents. In fact they don't think and expect the risks and bad results that will happen because of their careless action. Everyday there are many things that appear in the life. This group is always the first who looks and wait for many things. For instance when they hear there is a new fashion or modern wear you will find the teenagers there and you are lucky if you are able to find place between them inside the shops. Finally most of them could be pass the exams but they can't understand or improve their knowledge. The reason is they don't have objectives or goals for their life. They are thinking only for just the moments. In the future unfortunately they will be unhappy and have bad feelings when they try to understand that when the time is over.
