As a writer in English my weakness is my grammer I can feel my grammer is terribel simple grammer is okey but like complex grammer it's a mess ! Another big weakness is I don't know when I should finsh setence and start a new one it's my Chinese writing habit we prefer write many thing in one setence and continue it it shows you is a good writer but in English it's bad habit . My grammer teacher always correct my this kind of mistake . My strength as a writer I think maybe that is my organization because before I start writing I will think about my topic and organize all detail in my mind and writ it . It's my only good point as a writer in English .
