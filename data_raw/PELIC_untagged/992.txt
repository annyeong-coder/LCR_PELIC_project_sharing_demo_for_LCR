The city where I grew up was a Seoul which is the capital city of Korea. There are many apartments that have over 10 floors. I had lived about 20 years in the same apartment that is on the 4th floor. And most of my friends had lived an apartment that was close to my house. There were many places that my friends and I could play with. The place which I had lived was just a small part of Seoul however it was very convenient to live.
