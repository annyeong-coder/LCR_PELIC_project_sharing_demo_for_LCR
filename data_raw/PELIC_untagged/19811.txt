Although I had heard that football is very popular in the U. S from my friend who had lived for long time in the U. S I who first came to the U. S was unfamiliar with football. People in my country were unfamiliar with it. They were enthusiastic about soccer. I thought of why people in my country don't like football. The reason was why they don't know anything about football including rules and how to play football. I was starting to be interested in football after I learned the rules of football. These days I have been teaching my friends in my country comparisons between soccer and football in order that they can feel the enjoyment of football. There are three points of difference between soccer and football including rules how to play and what makes them popular in each country.
