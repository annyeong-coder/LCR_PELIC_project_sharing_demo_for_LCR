I've eaten many places in Oakland where I'm studying and my favorite place to have lunch that is Taiwanese Cafe restaurant. First that is located in the corner of Forbes Ave and Oakland Ave not so far my school. I like to eat there because I don't find another Vietnamese restaurant in Oakland and Chinese Taiwanese food is very similar with Vietnamese food. There are lots of my favorite food. I could like to eat with ANON_NAME_0 Chow Fried Rice Shrimp Vegetable Beef with Broccoli etc. . . They are fresh and delicious. I like to listen to music which is opened with low volume and romantic. There several pictures which are decorated very reasonable. In addition the price is acceptable with student.
