In this postcard the Liberty Bell which is a revered symbol of American freedom is hung up in the center. On the top of the Bell some sentences are quoted Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof By Order of the Assembly of the Province of Pensylvania for the State House in Philada. If you see it clearly you will find the different way of spelling of Pennsylvania in 18 century because the spelling of Pennsylvania was not universally adopted at that time. And in the middle of the Bell there is a 1. 5 Feet long crack which was happened in the journey to Philadelphia in 1752. Behind the Liberty Bell is the Independence Hall which is the most memorable building in American independent history. Also you can see other modern buildings on the right side I think it presents a combination of modern and history.
