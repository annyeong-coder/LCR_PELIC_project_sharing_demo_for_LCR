In my opinion open adoption is a great way of adoption especially in the future for the adopted kid. It will decrease many of their questions such as who are my birth parents why they didn't raise and take care of me and so on. Knowing that they are adopted later might affect them emotionally in a negative way making them ask why you did not tell us before.
