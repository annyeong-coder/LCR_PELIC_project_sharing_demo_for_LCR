I like my room dorm. First of all it's the place where I've grown up and I have many happy memories of my life. From time to time I think over making some changes acording to my preferences and necessities. One of my problems is the lack of space to my books I'm always hanging up new shelfs but after a while I fill them out and I don't know how to figure this problem out. In the end my books are widespread over the table the chair and even the bed so every time I go to sleep I've got to take them away. My mother is trying to talk me into find a solution to straighten my room up definitively but the thing is that I like my tidy chaos. There is another thing that I really like my room is very bright. I never lower the awning to let the sun in during the morning. I love wake up with the sunshines that cheers me up. Oh! I almost forget it! One of my most precious things is a Pulp Fiction poster that my brother brought me from Pittsburg. I put it up in the entrance so everybody can watch it from the corridor.
