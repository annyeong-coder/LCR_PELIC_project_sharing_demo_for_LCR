Time goes so fast in America After one week we will have a vacation for one month. I am planing to go to California to visit my brother I have not seen him for a year. I miss him so much and I want to see his baby daughter who was born last two weeks ago. After that I would like to go to Washington to visitmy childhood friend he called me last week that surprised me because I had not seen him since we graduated from the high school. That is a long time nine years.
