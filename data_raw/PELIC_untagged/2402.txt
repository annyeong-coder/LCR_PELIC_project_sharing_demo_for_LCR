I've beem studying English as the second language since a month ago and I'm having great time in Pitt because it's my first time in the USA. All things around me is exciting. I like to play some sports soccer and baseball. I played baseball on every sonday when I was a elemantary school student and I played a huge role as a slugger. And I've had huge interests with European soccer since the famous korean soccer player started to play in England. I've tried to get as many informations about strategy as possible and watch all games broadcasted on television. So when I noticed that the ELI soccer team was gathering some members I signed up immediately and I've benn playing soccer on every wednesday night. On the other hand reading books is also my hobby. When I was a elementary school student there ware school newspapers in my school and reading school newspapers was important homework. So it helped me to read something. I've been trying to read as many books as I can but it hasn't been successful. I'm still trying to read many books.
