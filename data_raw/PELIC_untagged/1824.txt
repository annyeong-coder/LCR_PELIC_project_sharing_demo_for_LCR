Since I was child I have dreamed to visit Disney land in the US. This dream is nearly going to come true. I plan next summer to go there for a month with my family and also my parents are going to fallow us there. I think we will enjoy our time there together. The reason that I chose next summer to visit Disney land that is my daughter will has turn three years old so she will enjoy her time too and be aware of every thing around her. In addition I can spend some time with my husband and be sure that my daughter is going to be in a secure place with my parents. By the end of our trip every one will have had a good time.
