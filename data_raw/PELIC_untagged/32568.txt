ANON_NAME_0 was my partner in the class of grammar at last week. She told me about some things which she's done. She's taken a long car trip with her brother and her friend when she traveled to Orlando in the Spring break. She was happy and enjoyed during that trip. She's been on a boat twice. Also she's eaten unusual dish when she's gone to a restaurant with her friends she's eaten shellfish. In addition she's met a famous Saudi singer and his brother in a Saudi embassy. Then she told me about some things which she's never done. She's always wanted to ride a horse but she's never ridden. She hasn't climbed a mountain and she's never gone camping.
