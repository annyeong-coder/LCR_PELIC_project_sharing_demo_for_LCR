I went to Bali last year. I stayed there for 5 days. There was very nice weather. I lived in a hotel and a villa. The hotel has severl swimming pools. I went to the pools when I lived in the hotel. I also had a great breakfast everyday. The breakfast is a kind of buffet. I could eat much fruit and bread everyday. In the villa I had a private swimming pool and a private place. I could relax myself when I was there. I also went to several famous places which like a traditional market in WuBu and Tanah Lot. In the traditional market I could buy many things with very cheap money. Tanah Lot is a temple which is built on the sea. Actually I had a lot of fun in Bali last year.
