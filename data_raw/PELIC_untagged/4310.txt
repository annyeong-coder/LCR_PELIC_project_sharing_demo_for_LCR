Instead of quitting suddenly I should have calmed down and thought it carefully again then decide because find a good job is not easy. When I quit suddenly my boss must have gotten angry my parents might have felt disppoint to me. I could have tried to commiunt with my boss before I got angry. I had to have asked my friends how to deal with it insted of felt angry with my boss. I should do better in the future.
