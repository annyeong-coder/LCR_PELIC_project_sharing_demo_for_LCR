Vienna is the city where I was born. I lived there with my parents whom I miss now. Our house in which we lived in Vienna included a yard. I remembered playing there with my only sister whose age more than me about one year. We used to hold the ladybird with our hands of which people think as a lucky fly. Also we enjoyed the flowers in the spring when they dehisced and perfumed the atmosphere. I love to travel to Austria whose capital is Vienna in order to repeat the recollections. In fact all my words that I'd like to say aren't able to express my real feeling toward Vienna.
