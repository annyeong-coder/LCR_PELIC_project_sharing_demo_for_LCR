I was in Dubai in 2011 I had an interesting experience to sky diving tube. It's not real sky diving but it's great. I had never tried it before I came to Dubai. I'd paid the fees before I wore the safety clothes. When it started blowing the air strongly from giant fans I had been trying to balance my body. I thought it would be easy to control myself. Everything that the instructor had taught me it flew with the strong pushing of the air. Now in Pittsburgh I would like to jump from airplane.
