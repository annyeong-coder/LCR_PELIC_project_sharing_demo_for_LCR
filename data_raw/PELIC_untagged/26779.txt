I met my friend Chenfan while I was studying at high school. We joined the same group while we were learning Chemistry at high school. We used to help each . We went to shop together. I was her bridesmaid when she got married. My husband and her husband were both working at Jiangsu University. I have a son so does she. Her son was born just one day early than my son in the same hospital . Our son went to the same kindergarten. I miss her.
