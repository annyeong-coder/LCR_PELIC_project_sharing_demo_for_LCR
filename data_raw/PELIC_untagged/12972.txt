Mongolian biggest problem poor people In 1990 Mongolia capital city Ulaanbaatar was Asian white women. That time the Ulaanbaatar was work city all people working all people friendly and they all cooperate with each others. But after the 1990 all people start own business so that time was worst time pretty most of them fall so that people was a first poor people comes out in Ulaanbaatar. So now country side people come in to Ulaanbaatar too faster Mongolian poor life increasing each year. Now in Ulaanbaatar 70 of Mongolian people living 50 of those peoples are poor so they causing lots of problem crime air pollution drinkers and kids working. Only solution is more work place and stronger law. Mongolian poor people all of them they live in Mongolian traditional house called ger. In winter time ger need worm so people burn sots of coal. So this reason Ulaanbaatar have big smog of are pollution. The government need build lots of buildings it need cheep. If that building expensive poor people can't tack so they are going to live in ger. Mongolian most people scare to walk in the night because the some poor people do crime in the night. Each day in Mongolia 2 3 crime happing so most suspect are poor people only reason is they don't have money so they doing crime. The kids working hard work for money but the fathers are usually drinkers. Mongolian kids and women working for support the family. Mongolian poor life affect the people feel down so they drink all the time but the other hand only kids and women working. Mongolian people need cooperate again so we can delete the poor life its only one solution
