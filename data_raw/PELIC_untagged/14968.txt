I have many new friends in Pittsburgh. ANON_NAME_0 Last Name is one of my new friends. When I first came to Pittsburgh I went to ANON_NAME_1 Helal restaurant. I was looking for any Saudi students to guide me until I become familiar with my new city. When I arrived ANON_NAME_0 was having his lunch with some friends. I choose one of them to ask him ANON_NAME_2 Last Name . He was talking and laughing so I thought that this is who I'm looking for. He offered his effort to me and helped me so much. After that ANON_NAME_0 became my friend because he was helping me with ANON_NAME_2's Last Name . When I rent my apartment he was looking for a new host family. He found it in the same area. ANON_NAME_0 and I live in Squirrel hill. We are also students In ELI.
