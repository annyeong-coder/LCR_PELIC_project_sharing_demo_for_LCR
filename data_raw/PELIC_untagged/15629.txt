When I was 2 years old I begged my parents to play the piano. If my older brother hadn't played the piano already I wouldn't have thought I want to play the piano . And if my parents hadn't admitted me to learn the piano I wouldn't have been in music world. When I was 6 years old I started to compose songs and piano sonatas. If my piano teaher hadn't been such a nice jazz pianist I wouldn't have compose many songs. Also if she hadn't encouraged me to send my song to competition I wouldn't have gotten a copyright with the song. Although I used to wish that I would had continued learning the Piano I stopped learning it. Because I had to study for entrance exam of junior highschool. After I got admission from my junior highschool my parents asked me what I want for reward of entering junior highschool. I said I want Flute . If my father hadn't play the Flute as his hobby and his sound hadn't been nice I wouldn't have said that. I was so happy about this. Because I had been wanted to play the Flute since I was 7 years old. But my father who is a dentist said that playing the flute is not good for child like you I was so tiny when I was in elementary school . If my dad hadn't said NO I wouldn't have been pleased so much like that.
