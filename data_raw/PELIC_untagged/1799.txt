Lebanon is a one of the rare democratic countries in the Middle East. Lebanon was found very early in the history . It goes back at least hundred thousand years. Lebanon was separated from Syria last century. Arabic and French are widely spoken but still Arabic is the official language. Apples and tobacco are grown in the south bananas and grape are grown in the north part. Arabic music has been changed in the last years but we still have a very famous classical music. Tourism has been considered our natural resource for many years because Lebanon is very famous in the world history
