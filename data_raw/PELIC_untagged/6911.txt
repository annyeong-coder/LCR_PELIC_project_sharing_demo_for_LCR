Ideally people should divide their trash according to its material and useful things should be recycled. In some advanced nations this system was made by government and works well. On the other hand in the US such system seems to be made automatically by the people who throw the trash away and the people who pick it up. This system doesn't need costs. For some people to pick up the trash might be important income. People are already used to this system. So it must be difficult that the government makes a new system as other country in which some laws compel the people divide their trash and inhibit to throw them out. Although I fundamentally don't like to throw something away at the roadside I think this system is useful limited in the US. But I have one question. Where does some trash which nobody want to pick up go At least in Pittsburgh I have never seen such trash which is leaved for long time.
