Ideal parents are those who give their children sufficient education since it is important for children to get abilities for living independently and education provides children with them. Parents can leave other things such as money or immovable property to their children as well. But they aren't as good as education in that they don't build children's character such as autonomy or capability of thinking and judging critically which is essential for good life where as education does. For example if parents leave big money to their children children might rely on it and make no effort to gain abilities required to get a job. Also the situation which one can get money without any serious efforts might make her him lazy. Moreover value of money could change as time goes by. Hence leaving money doesn't necessarily guarantee children's happiness. On the other hand if parents make their children well educated persons who have basic skills needed for living independently and can make effort to acquire new abilities for getting a new job their children would be able to live better life. Thus what parents should do is to provide their children adequate education.
