My friend who lives in Rome is planning to come in the US for the summer. His name is Michele. He works for the same company that which hired me in 2006. We worked in two different projects which were under the same Executive. Michele whose life philosophy is the glass is always as half full would like to change his life starting to move to the US. His parents who have a different perspective of life or whose life perspective is different don't want that he quits his job looking for a new one in a different continent.
