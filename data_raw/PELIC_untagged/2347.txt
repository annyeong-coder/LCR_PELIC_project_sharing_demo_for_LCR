Everyone eat anything to be alive and drink anything to be alive but nobody can't stay 2 days without sleeping because maybe he she will be crazy. From this scientific fact sleeping is the most important thing for human body. Our bodies want to take rest from work because we are not machines. When I want to speak about my sleeping habits I have to remember myself before 2 years ago. I have to sleep after work for 2 hours everyday. I felt bad when I couldn't sleep. For that I went to sleep as soon as be in my home. However I can't sleep after classes now because there's no enough time. So I usually sleep at 11 p. M. Everyday except weekends. I prefer to sleep all night until morning without waking up for any reason. Sometimes I hear sounds from outside or from my neighbors and that's make feel bad and anger. Recently I found a solution for this problem. My solution is putting my head under the pillow and close my eyes and my ears and sleep.
