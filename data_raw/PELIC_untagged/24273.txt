I found that I have use English in more that 1 way. When I speak to other non native speakers I have much confidence about my English so I can speak flucently Enligsh. Also we are easy to uaderstand each other. But when I speak to native speakers I feel nevours so sometimes I spoke Enligsh haltly. When I speak to ELI teachers it's much better because they're so nice while I speak to my grauduate admission officers I can not speak English as fulcent as I speak to ELI teachers. I try my best to use some unique words to show my English is good.
