There are two reasons that I think Martin is more convincing. First I heard someone has psychic powers before in my country and a lot of people confirm the ability that helps them to find their missing families and friends. I didn't trust it before but more and more people told me that was a truth so I changed my mind. Second there are some evidence have proved that Martin has the psychic ability to help finding missing people in the article. She can point out accurately where the victim is. For these reasons I find that Martin is more convincing.
