Happiness is the state of being free of stress and any other life concern. Many factors affect the people's happiness. Some people think that the life changes make the happiness a difficult dream while others think that there are many reasons for happiness. In my perspective happiness can be achieved by acquiring the good health satisfaction and family relationship. A healthy body is a golden treasure which causes the permanent sense of happiness. Since the people have many diseases they suffering from sadness more than the pain. In contrast many healthy people feel happy as a result of the good health. Sick people cannot buy the good health by the money but they believe that the health and satisfaction is the most expensive thing in the life. Sleeping at night with a feeling of satisfaction will help people to be happy. No one can change his life or his fate so the people who want the happiness they should accept their life as is to be happy. In addition many things happen accidently and without planning thus we have to give up to the fate and think about the pretty things in our life. Watching your children playing or your parents smiling will make you happy. Living in a close life with your family is needed. As a result that will push you to change your way of thinking and seeing the life. For instance sitting with the family on a dinner or going out on a picnic should improve your ability to life and seeing their smiles forever. In a word there are many factors which affect happiness such as good health accepted fate and sense of family you have to acquire these factors to be happy. Finally we have to notice that there are many people live in sick discontent and loneliness while they can change their life to the best very easy.
