My impression of Memorial Day Loving your country is a Faith In fact I read several story about the war and saving the country. It is important to remember those who sacrifice themselves because of their county. With out doubt remember those veterans are the smallest things we could give them. I have been in the USA since May 2006 during my stay in the USA I have seen the Memorial Day twice. Hearing the National anthem and raising the US flag all over the place is tremendous to see how they feel about their faith.
