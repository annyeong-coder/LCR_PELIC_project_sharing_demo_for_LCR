Dear As I am a pharmacist I want to get an admission at your univeristy in the USA. I am sure that your university will be the place for me to achieve my professional career objectives and academic goals. I was born raised and educated in Riyadh Saudi Arabia. In 2007 finishing my undergraduate education in the field of pharmaceutical sciences College of pharmacy at King ANON_NAME_0 University. I joined the Riyadh Military Hospital in the Pharmacy Department On July 2007 as a pharmacist. After that On August 2008 I joined Saudi Food and Drug Authority as a pharmacist in Research and Publication department. I joined to Najran University College Of Pharmacy as a teacher assistant on October 2009 and I got a full scolarship to complete my studying. When I was studying in Pharmacy College I discovered the huge gap between Saudi Arabia and others countries in the field of pharmaceutical development. At that time I decided to complete my study in pharmaceutical science and I chose the United State to achieve my dream. The United State plays a leading role in drug development and I hope to get an acceptance at any university in the USA. It will allow me to be qualified with the most updated pharmaceutical knowledge and experience in my chosen field.
