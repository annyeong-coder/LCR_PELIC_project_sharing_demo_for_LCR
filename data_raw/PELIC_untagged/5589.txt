There were three things that I had never done them befor I came here. First befor I moved here I had never played Golf because it isn't famous in my home country but when I came here I saw this game every whare so I dicided to try that and I've played this game 3 times. Second thing is that by the time I moved here I had never eaten Maxican food but here in Pitt I've eaten it several times. Finally befor I came here I had never played Paintball because we don't have any activity for this game in my home country but here in Pitt I've played this game two times since I came here.
