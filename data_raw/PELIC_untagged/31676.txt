I think food in my country is cheaper than food in the U. S. Also food in my country is healthier and fresher than food in U. S. In fact food in the U. S is greasier than food in my country. Also food in the U. S is bigger than food in my country. Food in my country isn't as tasty as food in the U. S because food in my country have more flavors than the U. S. And food in my country is as salty as food in the U. S.
