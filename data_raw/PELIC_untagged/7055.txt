Call them 'young people' 'learner' and 'pupil'. Sentiment is abundance. They effort with competitive. What is the student I can give many categories of student definition Students are somebody who is studying at school. Or a student is a child who is studying at a secondary school. Someone who is a student of a particular subject is interested in the subject and spends time for learning about it. The types of students have different meaning. First of all we can call them different word such as 'young people' 'leaner' 'pupil'. Young people are under 13 to 28. And we can call them 'learner'. That's why they have duty to studying and they have many exams for their grade evaluation. Therefore they have to learn to study. They spend all time for learning at school. Some people call them 'pupil'. Because that means that they are not young or not adult. They are elementary middle high school people or special of study people. Second of all their sentiment is very abundance. They are very curiosity inquisitive and interest. I think that their emotion of first is out of from curiosity. Also They take a fresh interest in life from friendship. And they enjoy learning new things. Finally they are full of competitive spirit. Such as students who work hard get better grades than students who don't. They compete with each other for the grade or examination. They make every effort for everything Such as to studying or to playing. They are concerned to do everything. Also they should effort for make progress their future. My point is that most Students are particularly interested in the improvement of teaching methods and skills and in the creation of student activities student managed businesses and cooperatives.
