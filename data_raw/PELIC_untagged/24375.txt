My two favorite ways to spend my free time are cooking different kinds of my favorite food and watching any interesting movies. Cooking is one of my favorite way to spend my free time with . For example yesterday I cooked two dishes one of them was a traditional food and the other dish was my favorite dessert called Kunafa . Furthermore two weeks ago my friends and I gathered in our friend apartment and we cooked together many dishes for our dinner. The second favorite way is watching any movies or any opposite my friends recommended to me or I would like to see. For instant last night was my day off in the ELI. I watched movie named As good as it gets my teacher recommended us to see . In addition last weekend my friend and I went to theater and watched movie was Avatar . It was so interesting. Trying to cook various kinds of food and watching movies both are my favorite ways to spend my free time. Almost I spend it alone but also I had a great time if I spend my free time with my friend.
