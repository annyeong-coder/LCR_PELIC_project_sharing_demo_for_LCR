I met my friend Hwajin While my school was having a festival. I drank beer with her while I was talking her. After that I called her continuosly. I liked her. I asked her to be my girlfriend. While I was waiting for her answer I felt nervous. Eventually she allowed me to see her. Now she is my important person.
