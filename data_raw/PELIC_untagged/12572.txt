The House in My Early Childhood Mok Po where I had grown up until I am 8 is a small city on the southwest coast of Korea. I moved with my family to Seoul which is the capital of South Korea. It was early childhood so I couldn't remember not much. We lived in an official residence which belonged to government for my father worked for the district government. It was a big traditional Korean style house. My family members are many. I lived with my parents two brothers four sisters and a maid who were from south island. My mom was always busy to cook in the kitchen. My father used to invite staffs who worked together in his same office on the traditional holiday. The garden which my father liked to plant some flowers was my favorite place. I learned many flower's names from the garden. My best friend whom I saw every day lived across from our house. We used to dye our nails with garden balsam on every summer. I also remember one New Year holiday when we had a singing competition. We all got together in the living room with which we played and talked together every day and sang a song in order. My parents were judges. My father gave us prize after finishing our songs. We saw a movie together with prize money in the next day. Now my sisters and brothers have all their own family. My eldest sister whom I liked best in my childhood lives near my apartment. We can't see one another but we often call and say hello. When we get together we like to talk about the old days when we all lived the house.
