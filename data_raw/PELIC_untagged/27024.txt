Hi this is my website I had been creating this site for several weeks. And I had just finished it. I will introduce myself to you. I'm an easygoing and helpful person I like it when people need my help and I can help them. I like computers from my childhood. I had been practicing how to use computers and how to surf the internet for many years. In my home country all of my friends are interested in computer. Every weekend we had been playing some of computer games. I finished my high school last month in my country. And I moved to USA to get English language in the ELI in University of Pittsburgh. And I'm hoping to get my bachelor degree in business. Thank you for reading I hope that I didn't take much from your time.
