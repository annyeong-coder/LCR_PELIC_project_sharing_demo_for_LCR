It has been around 7 years since I joined the physical therapy college in KSA. I met a girl who was my classmate was beautiful and kind. In fact in our culture you must talk to girl's parents If you want marry her. I was reluctant to talk to her parents while I was studying. I got opportunity to complete my studying in US after I graduated in 2003. I had to leave my country during one week before the end of my visa . It was difficult to me to make decision since I did not talk to her family. Within only one week though I talked to her father. Unfortunately I would get married only if I refused the chance of studying in US. Obviously I went to difficult option that I had to leave my country before I got married. It was selected eventhough It is rare chance. Today I have mixed views on whether it has a positive or a negative influence on my life. I ll come back to my country after I got my master degree. Within one years. However I could get the master degree . Unfortunately I did not start my academic program because I did not get TOEFL score. The TOEFL is difficult but it is not impossible. If I came back to my country I would met her.
