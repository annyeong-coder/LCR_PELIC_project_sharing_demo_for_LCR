People around the world face a lot of free time without doing anything. There are several types of activities that can be entertaining and done at the free time. Some of these activities need active movements some of them need attention and some of them need your physical attendance. The entertaining activities can be classified to many distinct categories such as home activities social activities and sports. Home activities are the easiest activities. Everyone can choose some of the things they like to do at home. For me reading books is the way to relax and get into another world by experiencing someone else's prospective of life. I also enjoy listening to the radio and hearing the news of the world. Watching TV is another method of entertainment at home. Social activities are acting as a relief for some people. These activities are one of the best entertainment features. I equate going shopping with fun. From my perspective shopping is exiting and buying new things brings happiness to me. Another social activity that I like is hanging out with friends. Spending time with some good friends is always affecting me positively. It is obvious also that gathering with my family always cheers me up. Sports are one of the activities that are entertaining. Swimming is one of my favorite activities. I like to go swimming when I feel bored. It is an activity that I enjoy spending my time doing it. Bike riding is also fun. When I have time and the weather is nice outside I call my friends so we can go bike riding outdoors. This activity makes me feel happy and healthier. I also enjoy playing volleyball with other friends. Spending time in choosing activities you enjoy and like can make your life better. Especially when you are spending most of your time in working or studying. These stressful daily life situations can be relived by giving yourself some time for entertainment.
