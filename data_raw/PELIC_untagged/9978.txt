I think that depends of each person because there's people that don't believe in a person that have psychic powers so that kind of persons are going to be more with Nickell and a person who believes in psychic powers can be more in favor with Martin. But in my opinion I think I can trust in Martin because she didn't miss a case still but at the same time I'm agree with Nickell because there's some information that is too general and everybody can say or guess.
