One of the funniest situations in my life happened two years ago. My friend has been living in Italy since 2002 so I visited Italy to see my friend. The fact that I travel Europe was exciting and I also expected that Italy might be one of the beautiful countries. While the airplane was going from Seoul in Korea to Genoa in Italy I worked out where we traveled around Europe. Our tour schedule was that we took a trip Milano in Italy to Paris in France via Z agreed that we resolve it into a train. First I was waiting outside with my friend baggage until my friend finish it. He appeared after a short time and then I entered into the train without my backpack. At last I began to relieve myself however the train suddenly start to move in gradually. At that time I realized that the train departed from the station in which my friend was standing a platform. It is impossible that I brought the train to a stop. I didn't know how I should do to meet my friend again. Fortunately I had a eurailpass and could avoid pinching a free ride. As a result of the happening I came back the prior station after getting off the train to next station. If I didn't have the eurailpass it was difficult that I returned from Switzerland easily. I don't know if his choice was right or not however it is certain that we made remembrance which we never forget.
