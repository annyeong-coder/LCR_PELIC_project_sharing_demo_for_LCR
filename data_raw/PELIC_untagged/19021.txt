Where in the world you would go if money were no object. Have you ever dreamed to go to the places shown on National Geographic Animal Planet or Discovery channels. I think you have. In our busy city life we have became so distant from the nature and sometimes forgot that we part of it. If the money were no object for me I would like explore wild nature. For example the first place where I would go could be African Savanna. I would love to observe wild animals life in their natural environment. During the trip I would like to have kind of guide person who is familiar with this places or person who is specialist in animal life and behavior or he may be specialist in surviving so I can feel myself safe. So I have made safe back from African Savanna now I'm going to go some coral island in the Pacific and dive. It would be so exiting to dive and see colorful tropic fishes and other ocean inhabitants and swim with them in case that there are not white shark . Dreams are going to come true so later I hope to write real impressions about my trip.
