I broke my foot. I was conscious for two hours. After that my neighbor took me to the hospital. At noon I called my boss and told him what happened to me. Then I asked him to take a vacation for one week. Therefore he gave me warning instead of a vacation. Later l had to go to the work next day. On my way to the work I decided to take a shortcut through on old par of town. Everything was going very well. Then 12 year old child showed up in the middle of the street. I tried to avoid him and I hit the wall. My car was totally damaged. The kid was scared. Later the police took me to the jail. They sent to the court. The judge convicted me. I had to pay the fine to go out of the jail. However I knew that I missed the meeting with me boss. She was angry because I missed the meeting. I was in a terrible condition. I tried to tell why I couldn't meet her She insisted not listen to me. Therefore instead of giving me a day off she gave extra work to do before I go home. While I was doing my work I dropped the coffee on my computer. The problem was I didn't save them. Also I had to do them again without a computer. Later I took a taxi to get home.
