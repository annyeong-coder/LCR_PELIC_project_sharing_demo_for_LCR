Miss Hannah was a widow who lived in a little gray low eaved house with a little but blossom garden along the shore down the hill that was isolated from others. For twenty years since her brother's ran away Miss Hannah waited his coming back with his promising of making her rich but still her brother Ralph was never coming back in the past. Even though many people include one of her best friend Jacob tried to persuade her that Ralph would never come back and wanted her to give up such hope but she always looked so optimistic at this hope and kindly refused all the concern from those people. So she kept waiting until one day in a cold winter she finally waited up her brother's coming back not with great richness but badly wrecked and battered. Even though she didn't get the richness she wanted but she still felt so blest since her brother was back.
