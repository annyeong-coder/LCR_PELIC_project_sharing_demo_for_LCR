He had encouraged me constantly to achieve my goal when I disappointed my score or I was exhausted. Finally I passed the exam. After we were married we still have talked a lot about the each problems that we are concerned in our works or studies to figure out for finding the solutions together. Therefore I am not afraid of my future and upcoming unexpected events because of my soul mate who is my husband. I believe if we collaborate we will be able to overcome any troubles together as long as we are healthy. Thus I hope he is healthy and stand by me forever.
