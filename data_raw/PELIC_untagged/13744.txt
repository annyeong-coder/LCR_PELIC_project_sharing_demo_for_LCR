2 Do you think it is important for people to eat home cooked food Why or why not I think eating home food is quite important for people. First of all it may make them healthier. If they cook by their selves they can control the mount of oil salt or other unhealthy condiment. Also they can eat more vegetable instead of fast food. On the other hand they can make sure that they use a high quality fresh food not an expired food. Because of these reasons I think people should eat home cooked food.
