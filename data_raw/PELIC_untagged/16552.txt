What did you do on last weekend On last weekend Saturday evening I hung out with my housemate at a lake in North shore for 4 hours . We did the sunbathe because we want to have tan skin and after that I went to my friend's house to watched a penguin game and had BBQ together . And on Sunday I took 1 of my Thai friends to Mountain Washington because on the top of the mountain she can see city view. We took a lot of picture. It was a good time for us and we walked around in downtown. On a last day of long weekend Memorial Day I went to shopping at Prime outlet Grove City with 2 of my friends. We got there since 4 o'clock in the evening and we shopped until 9 o'clock. I can't believe that we spent 5 hours there and also we spent a lot of money too. As soon as we finished from shopping we were hungry immediately. Finally we had Indian food for our dinner. We ordered chicken curry spicy level 10 ! It was really good. These are all about my weekend in Pittsburgh.
