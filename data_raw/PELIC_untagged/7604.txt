1. Present I know well 2. Past I know it more or less 3. Future I don't know nothing about it If I could live in any time period I'm sure I'd never change the preset for another period. I'm afraid of what I don't know and I think this is not bad period to live. Now days if we have the lucky to live in a occidental country you can live a nice and successful and life. But if I cannot live in the present I 'd live in the past. We know many things about the past because of history classes the documents the movies and it doesn't matter to me if I'd live in the S XVII in Venice of Florencia or to be a roman in the beginnings of the years. Maybe this kind of live is harder than we think about but I'd try to do my live in the better way I'd can. But what I'm so sure is that I'd never go to the future. This is an unknow period and maybe the humanity is always in catastrophic problems or the machines dominate humans Well I don't know maybe the life is beautiful but any case I don't want to go there to discover it.
