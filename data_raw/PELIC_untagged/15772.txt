When I was working in a physical therapy department I had two bosses ANON_NAME_0 and Basher. ANON_NAME_0 was older than Basher but Basher was more fun. Basher was not as smart as ANON_NAME_0 . They had different ways to control on the work. ANON_NAME_0 was more seriously than Basher but Basher was more carefully. ANON_NAME_0 supported me as well as Basher but Basher handled problems more successfully than ANON_NAME_0. I enjoyed my work with them.
