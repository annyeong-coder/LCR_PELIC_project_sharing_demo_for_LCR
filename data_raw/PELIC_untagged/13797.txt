DEAR ANON_NAME_0 ANON_NAME_1 Sorry I haven't written topic but I've been really busy. I just went into a now University . Here's what a typical day looks like for me I get up early usually at 5 30. After paring showering and having breakfast I get on the bus and go to my 10 00 English class. In addition to English I'm taking Grammar this semester. I'm finding it really hard but I'm going to keep up it. I'll need it later for Geology school. After classes I have just enough time for a quick lunch with some friends before getting to Subway's at 12 55 for my one hour . On the way class I've been picking up some things for my University. This evening for example I bought a new book which I'm going to put together this weekend. When I get home I prepare a quick dinner and then spend several hours on my homework. By the time I turn off the lights its 1 03 a. M. And I'm absolutely exhausted. Will that's enough about me and my life. I really don't think that I've left out anything important. How are you What have you been doing I'd love to see you. The weekend of the 18th I'll be going to visit Shin Young Park but I'm sure it would be Ok for you to come along with me. Let me know! Looking forward to hearing from you ANON_NAME_2 P. S. I think me threw away victor's e mail address before copying it into my address book. Do you have it
