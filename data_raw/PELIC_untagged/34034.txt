Jon ANON_NAME_0 would you mind if I ask you a pice of advice I have a problem with my girl friends. Despite the fact that I am handsome kind and generous they always domp me. I always bring flowers and gifts for them. I never forget their birthday. In spite of this I end up with the same result. What should I do then ANON_NAME_0 well I recommended that you should follow one of my sugitions . Ether to be a devil or to be an angel. First if you prefer to be a devil. You ought to domp them befor they do. You should not be kind with them first place because they don't deserve that. You ought to pretend that you are an important person and busy so you forget about their birthday. Some girls are mean so they deserve to be treated like that. Second if you still prefer to be an angel. I might be your girl friend but you had better forget about our previous conversation .
