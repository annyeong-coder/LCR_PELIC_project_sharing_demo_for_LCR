I lived in Pittsburgh and I have three roommates. One of my roommate like party very much the music is loud I want have a considerate roommate and don't party too late on that time. One of my roommate is reliable and have been very helpful since I arrived Pittsburgh. And the last roommate always keep the room neat she just do homework and quietly at room. I lived in this room is very cheerful.
