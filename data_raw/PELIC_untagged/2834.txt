One of my favorite places to hang out is home because I own the place. However if 5 friends call on my door I have to think it over because later I'll need to clean up the house. And I also love to eat out but sometimes I end up making a Sandwich and watching a DVD while I'm eating. But eventually I get bored and I need one way or another to go out. However after my run away I feel I need to get back home again.
