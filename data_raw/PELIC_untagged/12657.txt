I'm thinking the Hula hoop is most popular in many countries. I remembered me kid time that time hula hoop was most big fad. I was in 8 years old most kid was have hula hoop but I wasn't. I was really want hula hoop but me prance have didn't that mach money. All marked were selling hula hoop I think they was making fortune money. All day I mood was depressed because I wasn't have that toy. One day I went my school one of me friend told lets go to shopping I told him we don't have money but he show me lot of money. I was shocked he told me I fond it was tricky to me. But me design was a buy that toy so followed him. That time was likely dream we spend lot of money in many thing. In noon our prance find us but they were anger looks scary. His scrim at me but I didn't understand. Finally he told me he steals his mother's money so I told her I bought only hula hoop but she asked from me she need proof. I showed her hula hoop and I told her all things so give the hula hoop again I feel up seat. That time I leaned business fad can change kid from good to bad.
