When I was 17 years old I started singing. My vocal teacher made me learn about sing music. Also She had me enter for university. My parents let me sing. Also My parents helped me take care of health. My sister helped me read score. Also she got me to learn singing. Because She's composer. So She had me learn singing. Sometimes She helped me play piano. My high school teacher let me learn music after classes.
