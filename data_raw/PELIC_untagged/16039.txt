Two years ago I was really upset because my dad passed away suddenly. When he still alive I should have requested he went to the hospital when he said his stomach hurt often. I shouldn't have gone out with friends always and I should have spent more time with him. When he asked me out for breakfast I could have said Yes instead of I want to sleep . I had to become mature early and shouldn't have him worried me a lot. I could have controlled my temper and didn't argue with him for a little stuff. I might have told him I love him instead of angry or ignore hime.
