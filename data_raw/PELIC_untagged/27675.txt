Tizens are educated and committed to their country. We're so proud of how far we come in a few years. Saudi Arabia a land rich in history culture and traditions is located in the Arabian Peninsula and consists of thirteen provinces. Each province is distinct from one another which explains the diversity in the culture the peoples' personalities and the ways of life. Riyadh located in the central region is the capital of Saudi Arabia and houses all the government departments. Makkah is the holiest city in Islam and the birthplace of Prophet ANON_NAME_0. Makkah joins the greatest gathering in the world because every year millions of Muslims go there to perform hajj or pilgrimage. Medina is the second holiest city in Islam. It's the city where Prophet ANON_NAME_0 lived and buried. It's also visited by Muslims all year long. Islam has influenced every aspect of the Saudi culture such as architecture clothing food and greeting. As Salam alaikum peace be with you is a universal salutation among Saudis and Muslims. The standard reply Wa alaikum assalam means and upon you peace . One of the first things that impresses foreigners in Saudi Arabia is the generous hospitality and the welcoming attitude which is an inherent feature of the Saudi tradition. For Saudis nothing symbolizes the tradition of hospitality more than the ritual serving of the Arabic coffee and the fresh dates. A Saudi host takes pride in honoring his guests by providing copious quantities of food. He would fail in his social obligation if he allowed any guest to leave his table hungry. Saudi Arabia has great aspects of life that no one knows about. It's a country that succeeded in balancing culture traditions good principles with progress. After all despite the cultural differences we share the same desires values hope and pain. It's our responsibility as Saudis to present the kingdom in a positive image and to provide a better understanding of what Saudi Arabia is.
