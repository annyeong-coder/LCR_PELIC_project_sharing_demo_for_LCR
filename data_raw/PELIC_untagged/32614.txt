The environment that you raised in has a strong effect on shaping your personality. Living in a city is completely different that living in rural areas and both of them have advantages and disadvantages. People have different opinions regarding this issue and each one has his own rationale. Although many people think that living in a city has an advantage of being in an area with full health care facilities I believe that living in the countryside is healthier. Living in a countryside means living in an area that is not crowded with people or cars or buses all of which pollute the air and have a direct effect on people health. While many people claim that by living in city you have the opportunity to access schools universities and shopping malls easer people in a countryside having the chance to enjoy the beautiful views around them which the people in the city can not do. Moreover they defiantly have less stressful life than the people who live in the city. People argue that people living in the city have the chance to build relationships with that elite powerful wealthy rich people which can help them later in making business or having the chance to get the job that they are looking for. I believe that people living in the countryside not only more independent and hard worker but also have a better communication skills that people living in the countryside. Furthermore they have a stronger relationships with their family and the people they love since they don't have that type of busy live other people have.
