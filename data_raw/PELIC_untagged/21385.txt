Before I wanted to study a master degree in Taiwan I need to take the master entrance exam. Actually I'm reluctant to take my military duty and I have to prepare my entrance exam at the same time. Generally the professional subjects are very abstract and sometime the answer of the question is very ambiguous. In my opinions hardship reveals their value that's why I give up all of my vacation time that I can take a rest in my military period. I didn't violate any regulations and try to study my entrance exam. What I need to adapt is to get along with peers well and to concentrate on my studying. In fact it's pretty diverse experience for me when I was a student I didn't treasure any resources I had when I left a school and want to go back to school again I knew that to be a student is a very precious thing. A military is an very arbitrary place you should conform the command commissioner gave so I implemented my studying in the mid night I try to pursue my any chance to study my professional knowledge and persist with this target. I thought I never determine to do anything which is so serious. After I finished my military duty I went to a public library for one month and took the master entrance exam right away fortunately I passed the test and defeated lots of competitions indeed I didn't know why I can persist with this unhumanized life because I studied over 15 hours every day it demonstrates that if I want to achieve any target anything is possible.
