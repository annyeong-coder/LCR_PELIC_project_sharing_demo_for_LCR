In my opinion taking Writing 4 is very helpful. First of all you can learn how to write a formal essay. For example your teacher will teach you how to write a cause effect essay. Besides your classmates are the best partners. For instance discussing with your peer group can let your have rich ideas. Moreover the feedback from your teacher is very useful. Finally you have better to rewrite your essays to make them better. I hope you can learn a lot from Writing 4.
