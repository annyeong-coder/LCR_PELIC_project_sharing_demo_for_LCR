What I talk to yours is very funny story. Once upon a time one philosopher takes a ferryboat and he ask ferryman that did he has ever learned literature. The ferryman doesn't understand why he asks that question and answers No. Therefore the philosopher says What a helpless man! You have lived wrong in your two thirds totally life. And he asks ferryman again Do you know what philosophy is The ferryman answers again No. The philosopher thinks that it is funny that the ferryman did not learn literature and philosophy. After that while going across the river the ferry was sunk by a storm. At that time the ferryman asks the philosopher Do you know how to swim The philosopher answers No. Therefore the ferryman says that he has lived wrong in his whole life.
