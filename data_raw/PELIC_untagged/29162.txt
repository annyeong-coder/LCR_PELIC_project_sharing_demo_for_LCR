Chili peppers are used all around the world from Thailand to the USA from Asia to Europe and Africa. Chilis are hot because of capsaicin which has some important medical effects such as increasing endorphins which reduce arthritis and other body pains. Chilis also might reduce the common cold and decrease cholesterol.
