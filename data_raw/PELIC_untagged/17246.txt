Most important personality is patience. When people continue social life which is studying or working people often tend to give importance to ability. Some people also say sociable characteristic. However I think that it is the patience which I most want to have. If someone suffers difficulty which could be serious or small and he works hard with patience there will be good result for him. In my case which is studying in the USA it's very hard time in my whole life. If I just give up there's no result. But if I try to study more and do more activities I will gain lots of experience and also improve my English. One of my friends whose major is emergency treatment always studied hard with patience. Finally he got a qualification last month. As I mentioned above I think that the patience is most important personality in my life.
