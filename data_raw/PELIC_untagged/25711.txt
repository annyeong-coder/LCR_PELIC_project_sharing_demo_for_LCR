I had studied English as a second language in my home country before I came to the United States for three years. In the middle and high school we study the meaning of some English words and some English bases. In my country studying English as second language in the middle and high school is different from studying it in the Universities. In the middle and high schools we studying the bases and UNDERLYING materials. Also studying English in the universities is the same as studying English in the United States. However in my country we don't practice our second language outside the class whereas we practice our second language outside the class in the United States. Teachers in the United States are speaking English as a native language on the other hand teachers in my country aren't speaking English as a native language.
