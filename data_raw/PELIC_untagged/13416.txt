My name is Student's First Name . I grew up in Taipei Taiwan but now I've lived in Pittsburgh. I've been studying English for a few months in Pittsburgh but I still take time out to play. Since I studied English in University of Pittsburgh ELI . I've joined some activities in ELI. This month I've already completed two Talktime with a native speaker. In fact last semester I also joined Talktime with a native speaker. I think it's great to practice English. So I've been joining this program in this semester. I've been practicing English of this group. And I believe my English is getting better.
