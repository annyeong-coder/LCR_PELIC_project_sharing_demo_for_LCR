On the economy We've made little A LITTELE progress but we still have a great many DEAL OF work to do so there are several measures I'm proposing. First I want to rise taxes on the very wealthy because a few FEW of them are really paying their share. Socond many of members MANY OF THE MEMBERS of the middle class are carrying an unfairtax burden so I am asking for a tax cut for the middle class. If I am successful most of you in the middle class will be paying 10 percent less in taxes next year though few of A FEW OF you in the higher income group may see your taxes rise littele A LITTELE. The problem with the national income tax is that there are much MANY loopholes in the current law which allow any some people to avoid paying any SOME taxes at all I want to close these loopholes. My additional plan is to replace the lost revenue with a national sales tax which is fairer because it applies to every ALL people equally. Third We have no money to finance health care reform and we've made a littele LITTELE progress in reducing pollution and meeting clean air standards.
