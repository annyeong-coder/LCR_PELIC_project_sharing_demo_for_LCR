Academic program application Master's programs provide an access to people who want to enhance their academic knowledge. I believe that professors need excellent students to participate in their researches. Therefore it is no doubt that you accept me to be your student because of my great personality and excellent research outcomes. When I was a college student I learn not only basis classes but also professional courses. Although my major was Electric Engineering I have very strong interest in Computer Science. As a result I chose some classes that related to Computer Science. I also chose two projects to do more research. In my senior year I spent a lot of time doing projects with my teammates. Sometimes our opinions have giant difference. However we discussed and tried to figure out the best resolution. In the end we finished our projects. Sometimes I encountered some problems that I could not deal with them. Thus I would like to discuss with my classmates and found the resolutions. I would like to discuss with my professors too. They often gave me some advice and let me find the answers by myself. By doing this I developed the ability of independent thinking. Additionally I joined a competition that was hosted by our department with my classmates. We spent about three months from finding topic planning the programming structure testing the efficiency and presentation. I thought that I could be responsible so I had willing to be the leader of my team. Finally we won the competition. In my college life I found that I have strong interests in Computer Science such as programming languages and the structure of computers. I believe that your master's courses can give me the best education and environment for researching. Therefore I would like to do more research and apply master's program.
