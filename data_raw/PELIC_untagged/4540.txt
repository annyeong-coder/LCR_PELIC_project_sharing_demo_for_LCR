I met my friend Namie while I was coming in my room. She is one of my roommates. I was very surprised because when I entered the room she was lying on the bed and she said Hi Jao! How are you . Jao was her friend. That is the event when I was a freshman. After the first year finished we moved out from that dormitory. Three years later when I was senior she became my roommate again. We spend all most time together that why we have had very closed relationship.
