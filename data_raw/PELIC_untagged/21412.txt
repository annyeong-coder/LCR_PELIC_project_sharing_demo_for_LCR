If we go to a desert island we have to take three significant things matches a knife and a flashlighter. Why do we have to take this stuff The answer is so simple because we must take them in order to survive. For example with a knife we can hunt an animal because we have to eat something. Also we can cut food or fruit easily by the knife. In addition we may able to defend ourselves against wild animals by using the knife. The second stuff is matches. For instance we could hunt an animal but we cannot eat it without burning. For this reason we must take matches. The last stuff is flashlighter. With flashlighter we can see easily at night what we look. A flashligh is not as important as other stuff but we d better take it if we go to a desert island.
