I like sports. Especially I like basketball and soccer. They are one of the most famous sports in the world because they are one of the most exciting sports. Basketball is more famous than soccer in the USA. The other hand soccer is more famous than basketball in Europe. The rule is very different each others. Basketball ball size is as similar as soccer ball. However soccer space need bigger than basketball space. Basketball need 5 people but soccer need 11 people. The most important thing in basketball is height. Basketball sense is also important but tall person have more profitable than small person. The other hand Height isn't the most important thing in soccer. Soccer have big event which is called World Cup. It is the biggest event but basketball don't have big event. I wish basketball had big event.
