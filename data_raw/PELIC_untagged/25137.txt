MY Time in America My experience is about my first time I came to america before I came I was in saudi arabia and I know little things about americas like the weather the people are friendly and they have better education. I started read more about them and what is the between the cultures . After all of that I decided to go to america and take my hight school diploma from them . Before my flight I was nerves because is was my first time to leave my family alone and I am going to new country. When I got to america I was scar nerves and happy in the same time.
