I've read the quote by Diane Arbus. I think it means she has tried to travel where she's never been. I have been to Germany since 2001. I have climbed the Heidelberg castle. It was ancient but it was a stately building. I have gone to the Goethe's house. Also I have drunken a lot of beer and I have eaten traditional sausages at Nurnberg. I have always wanted to go Greece. Because I love 'Mamma Mia' Greece is the background of the musical. I have wanted to see the Mediterranean Sea. In addition Greece is the birthplace of democracy Western philosophy and the Olympic Games. I always have wanted to go there.
