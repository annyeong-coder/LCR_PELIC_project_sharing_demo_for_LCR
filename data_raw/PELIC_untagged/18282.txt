No unless the Gaviotas redefines its premise of utopia I don't think it's a truly peaceful and liberal community for all time. According to Plato's Republic the Utopia citizens are all mature enough to deal with all living issues which means the evils inherent in humans' nature greed and desires are removed. Therefore a completed yet flexible educational system is crucial to achieve this ideal which obviously hasn't been paid much attention by the Gaviotas citizens and executives. The Gaviotas are satisfied with their natural and sustainable life style new technologies combine agriculture however without a complete educational framework and practice their dream is limited. For instance like Jannie mentioned about the growing population in this community the demand supply unbalance always trigger conflicts. Moreover the answer about no Crime of compassion is not valid. Since no one gets married and having sex is free who is the kid's father is an awkward question for every Gaviotas citizen.
