No matter on Friday or Sunday I am doing typical rutine such as eating washing and clothing. On Friday I used to feel free and make plan for enhancing my spiritual energy for new week. On Contrary on Sunday I feel nervous for anticipating new day. On Friday I am busy for enjoying my own time in comparison on Sunday for trying to think positively about finishing the last day off of weekend. Usually someone who has thier own job dosn't like Friday come early because they think that they have many works to do in the day of the work week. Unlike them someone who works for others such as bored employees welcomes Friday come early because the weekend is only thier own time. For me I need more Fridays. So I love the ELI schedule. Because I have two Fridays a week which are Tuesday and Friday!
