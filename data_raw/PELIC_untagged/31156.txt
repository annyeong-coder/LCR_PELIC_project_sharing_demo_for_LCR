What is a legal adulthood exactly It is people who are 18 years old at least. Even if it is adjusted by law it does not make sense. Because some people who are just 18 years old cannot behave rightly. For example they can buy cigarette and smoke but they cannot buy beer and drink. Even though they cannot do that probably they want to drink. Also if they try to buy alcohol and drink they can! The most important thing to determine a legal adulthood is not physical age but mental age. When they are not adult they have a lot of limitation. Actually a number of accidents are happened when they just become adults by legally. In Korea usually parents do not let them go out living alone. Sometimes it looks caring too much but I think it is a good way to make their children more mature mentally.
