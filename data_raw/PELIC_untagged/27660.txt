My Room When I moved into the apartment I couldn't help complaining My goodness! What a mess! . Therefore I teamed up with my cousin to straighten the room up and move some furniture around. Now it looks neat and spacious. For me the room is the place where I can relax and I feel comfortable. In my free time I like to turn my computer on put my earphone on pick some music out on Youtube it cheers me up all the time. In addition my room is bright. All I need to do is take the curtain down and let in the sunlight so I don't turn light on in the daytime. The problem in my apartment is the location is close to the main street so it makes me feel noisy sometimes. At midnight I can hear ambulance pass by and people shout or yell with excitement. I am trying to figure out how to improve this situation. To make the room feel like home I think I will pick carpets bonsai and pictures up to decorate my room. Hang the pictures on put the carpets on the floor and then set the bonsai on the table. If I change it a little the room would be very different.
