It is so suprised when I readd this story because general people can't success easily. She has an obstacle but she was tring to hard and got sucess. It's very respect thing to me. She already know that too late to stop about percussionist andd she choose to do with her life. It sounds like passion about music and percussionist life. Maybe that is big decision for her so I think she is really great women even she has hearing impairment.
