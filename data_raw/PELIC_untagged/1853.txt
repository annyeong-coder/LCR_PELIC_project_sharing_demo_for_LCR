I disagree with Clouse. I believe there are evil people and I think they are basically evil. For example about 500 years ago there was a kin in my country. He was grown up without his mother because his mother had been killed by his grand mother. One day he heard that his grand mother killed his mother and he was furious and killed his grand mother and all the people who agreed to kill his mother. I think he was evil. I don't think people are basically alike. My cousin who is 8 year old girl is another example. She is too selfish and cares about other people. I think she believes an eye for an eye . If her mother steps on her foot by mistake she hits her mother or does the same thing to her mother. I have never seen such a bad kid. I can't understand how she can so that. I think it is natural to her hitting her mother or yelling at her mother. I think bad people are basically bad and there are evil people.
