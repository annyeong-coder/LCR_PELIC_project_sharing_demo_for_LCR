Some parents should not be assumed that their children will be able to provide for them in their aged years if they are in need. Nevertheless some children were neglected by their parents in this situation when his parents were absent from their child's life. The adult do not feel that he is responsible for taking care of his parents because they were not part of his childhood. Despite I think that even if your parents were absent in your childhood it is your responsibility to take care of them. Also one of the reasons that I believe in is that your parents never wanted to be away from your life. In addition I think that if you take care for your parents that will influence your kids and they will do the same. In conclusion some adult children take care of their parents because they want to return the favor of rising them when they were little kids. Also they think that grandparents are really big part of the family. In contract some people do not think that they have to take care of their parents like children who did not have their parents as a part of their childhood or who were neglected by them.
