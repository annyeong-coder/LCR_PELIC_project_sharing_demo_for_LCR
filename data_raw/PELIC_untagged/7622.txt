Pittsburgh transportation could be thought one of the best cities in the United States. The transportation has included whole city from the downtown to the Airport. It is so convenient to service the citizens and visitors. I have been riding the subways and the buses for more than l year. Also I believe some buses and a few subways that are safe and quick. But happening something was made me so terror by the bus. One day. I rode 46G went to downtown. When the bus was working in a bus way I saw few black smokes from the bus. Speedily I told to the driver about the bus may have problems with not fluency English. First the bus was stopped passengers were ordered to go out the black smokes were checked and fixed. Then the bus was believed secure continued to go. Soon I heard a scream and saw lots of black smokes covered whole the bus. I couldn't see the driver who had been hided by the black smokes. The sense was threat very one escaped for the danger bus. Finally firefight men end the case.
