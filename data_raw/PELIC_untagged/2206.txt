I want to tell you about my study habits. First I believe you can not study in noisy place. But for me that is not impossible. I can study for this place but I can study hard. Second before the study I do some thing. For example I clean my apartment and I wash my clothes be cause I like a quite environment for studying. Then I wear soft clothe be cause I want to relax when I study. Then I make my favorite coffee Arabic coffee . I go to my bed room at 9 00 p. M. Then I use my computer to study that helps me to study hard. Some times I can not write any thing. For example when I am thinking about my family. Butt when I don't thinking about them I feel better. That means I can study hard. I try to use new ideas. And some times I have a problem about my subject How I can confirm my information Third when I finish the study I eat rice with meat and I watch T. V. After that I call my father and mother and girl friend and I tell them every thing I did for this day. Finely I listen to Arabic music. Next I sleep at 12 00 p. M. These are my study habits
