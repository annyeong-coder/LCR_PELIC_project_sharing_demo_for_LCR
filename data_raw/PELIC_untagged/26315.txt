Living in a college dormitory has several advantages. The first advantage is near the school. For example my college dormitory is in the school area so I just need to walk to the school. The second advantage is very convenient. For instance the dormitory has any furniture you need. You just need bring your own stuff. You can find everything you want near the school. You don't need to worry about the electricity water and internet bill. You can focus on your education. The third advantage is very safe. If you want you enter the dormitory you need pass to the guard and they will ask you to show some evidence to prove you live in the dormitory. To conclude live in the college dormitory has a lot of good benefit for me because I don't need to worry other things I just need focus on my study.
