My bedroom is on the second floor and has a big window which looks out on the grove. That means nothing obstructs our view from the window. I like this view very much and it makes me relax in the room. When I look out of the window I notice it is snowing quite quietly. I see also children and dogs run about in the park. But this room has no lights on the ceiling so we set a lamp down. In addition the color of the wall is tan therefore I would like to get down to change the color to white. Besides the room is not so big so I must always put away my books which are putting down. These days I apt to forget taking care of the plant crying out for water. In conclusion right now I like my house. As our present agreement will run out on May we want to put it off.
