In general students are very lazy so I think when they can study at home they will do nothing. In Saudi Arabia student can study at home by a privet teacher but it costs a lot. There are three bad effects for this habit. First of all as I said above it causes the laziness. For example if you do not have to attend the school you will never think that you have learn. Second students will miss the resp0onsability. For example student will feel that he doesn't to do anything with his study. Third it may cause the unemployment. For instance the student will used to stay at home so will not being interesting to get job. In conclusion In my opinion that would be a big mistake if they do it.
