I was shocked by the picture on the book No one's Perfect in a book store 10 years ago. The picture was its writer Mr. Hirotada Ototake who has very short arms and no legs from his birth. It is said that this book is one of the most popular books written by the disabled people and I have admired him since I read it because he lives his life positively at his own pace in spite of his inconvenience. The book doesn't show any hardships that he suffered. His childhood and adolescence were full of fantastic experiences. It is believed that he has a special ability to overcome any obstacle. However his family said He is not special but known to be a born optimist. It is thought that he got lots of harassment in his childhood. However he was regarded as a mischievous leader among his friends. When he was attacked by a bully he chased the bully at high speed by his electric wheel chair. On the other hand he was responsible for typing the school news and it was reported in some interviews that his academic performance was always top class. Now he is a teacher at an elementary school in Tokyo. Compared with other countries there are less opportunities for children to interact with the disabled people in Japan. He is expected to be a good role model for children.
