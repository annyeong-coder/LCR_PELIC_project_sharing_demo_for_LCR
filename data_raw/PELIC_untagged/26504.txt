Be creative and curious is inherent to children's personality. However according to the authors children loose these characteristics by the third or fourth year. The authors identify seven factors for this change a constantly surveillance of their work the evaluation of their work by others an excessive use of rewards putting them in a competition situation over controlling their school works restricting the choice of their activity and establishing a great pressure on them. In my opinion there is a part of truth in the author's opinion. However it is maybe a bit simplistic. Indeed all the seven criticisms that the authors do depict also important implements in order to teach children the best way to learn. To summarize it is true that some schools may be too rigid with creativity but nonetheless children need a frame in their way of learning.
