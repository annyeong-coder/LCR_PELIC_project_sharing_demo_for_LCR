The family can be defined as a group of people living together and usually consisting of parents and their children or it can be defined as a group of people who are closely related by birth or marriage. For example my nuclear family consists of my father my mother my sister my brother and me. Then on my father's side he has six brothers and four sisters. On my mother's side she has three brothers and three sisters. Also each member of this close family may have other relatives. So we can describe the family as a tree that started for long time ago as a seed from god and grew up to the end of the life. In my community all the families are related to each other in some ways because we have huge relationship with each other and we marriage from each other. Also all the families share their happy or sad events. I can say that my community is all close to each other as one part you can't break it.
