In my opinion the ideal parent should have several features. First of all ideal parents should be fair. For example my parents who are the ideal parents treat my siblings equally. Moreover ideal parents should correct children's bad behavior. For instance when we do something wrong my parents always teach us to be good. In addition patience is very crucial. Some parents who are not patient may have bad influence on their children. Besides ideal parents should love their children. Some parents who have their baby by accident may think that if they did not have this baby they would be free. There are a lot of traits which are required to be ideal parents. I wish I can be an ideal parent as good as my parents in the future.
