My family which consists of six members lives in Dammam. In this picture my parents who are retired stand close to each other. My oldest sister who teaches chemistry wears a red T shirt. My youngest sister with whom I traveled last year holds a white bag. My brother who is studying software engineering at KFUPM wears traditional Saudi cloths. This picture was taken in Qatif where I was born. I took it four years ago when I was studying in the college.
