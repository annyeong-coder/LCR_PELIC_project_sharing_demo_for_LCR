Seoyun Chai Oct. 7 2011 Technology If I would not use the Internet what is going on I wake up at 7 20 and immediately turn on the laptop. Checking my e mail is the first step that is a way to start a day. Then I read news on the web and chat with my friends on Facebook. It is my morning. I do every day. So I cannot live without Internet. Can you think about that living without Internet It will be too hard to connect other country and we would live small world as a frog lives in a well. Here is the three effects using Internet talk with someone easily share our concept in the world and collect more information. First of all using Internet makes us to communicate someone who lives far easily. It is important for me. Because I live in U. S. But my family and friends live in Korea. So Internet is method to talk with my family and friends every day. For example if I couldn't use the Internet I would write letters and send them to Korea. That method is too late however Internet makes it be immediately. We can chat call someone who lives far even we see he she's face on the monitor. That is shown that our technology life growing fast and very convenient. Second using Internet can share everything in the world. Before we use Internet we had shared news in tiny little group like family small town or school. Though now we can share everything in the world as using the Internet.
