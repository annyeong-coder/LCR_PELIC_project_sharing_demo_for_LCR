My favorite place to eat either lunch or dinner is La Mont restaurant in Mount Washington. I like to eat in this restaurant for several reasons because it sell a really fancy French food for example I like to eat stuffed chicken ravioli and of course special La Mont salad. I can honestly say I was impressed by the food. La Mont is my favorite place not just because the food also for many reasons such as La Mont was voted the most romantic restaurant in Pittsburgh. Moreover La Mont get number 2 on the most beautiful places in America because of the spectacular view from the mount and also I like it because of the good service and the friendly environment. In the end La Mount is really the place for special occasion.
