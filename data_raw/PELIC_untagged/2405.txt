Tourism is the most important income for the country and also it can put the country in a good image between the countries. Every famous country has to be visited for tourism every year from different countries. This way the country income will increase. In the other hand threaten security can effects the country income at the first place and if there's not that can effect or damage the country income. That's my opinion as a tourist and that's what I look for in the first place. The prediction that had mentioned at the article I don't believe it. It can be true and the reason why because all the results had been discovered by specialist people in this field. In a conclusion in my point of view the results can be true and it could be not.
