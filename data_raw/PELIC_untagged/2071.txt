Success The word success has a lot of definitions from people or books. Many people think that success related with relationships careers or money. Other people said it about prizes and awards. Some books have anther meaning for success such as reaching goals a good event or good luck in life. Success in my definition it's to get what you plan for. However my friend said it's achieving your goals. On other hand my wife said if you want to feel great you must get to your goals. All this definitions or thoughts from people friends families and books are not the same. I think the differences come from culture generation and how we understand success.
