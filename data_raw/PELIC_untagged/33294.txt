I painted our house last summer . The job took about two weeks . First the exterior was washed using warm water and a mild detergent . Then all the chinks and proes in the walls were sealed with putty . After the putty had had a chance to dry the exterior could be pinted . A latex paint was used because it is easy to apply and clean up with water . A whole week was needed to finish this part of the job . I was very careful to apply the paint evenly because I did not want to have to apply two cost . The original color wes very close that used a color . Our house is a two story house which meant that a tall ladder was needed to do the second story . The paint can had to be balanced on the top rung of the ladder while I worked . When the job was finished I was felt great deal of satisfaction . I had to pat myself on the back . Even my dad said that a good job was done .
