Siddiq Meer Grammar 3G Mar 4 2012 Time Capsule On November 25 2009 I created a time capsule. We buried it inside old box made from wood. The capsule contains five items. Each item tells something about the lives we live today. For example I put old Arabic book talk about the Arab heritage my Family tree since my grandfather who lived before fourteen centuries ago and until this now Some Indian artifacts Awards received during my studies at the elementary school and Some ancient coins which back more than a hundred years. I put these items to be a wonderful memory for me and my children. Because human nature does not forget his past event his present is professional. In the past simple thing which was experienced by grandparents although the distances between them.
