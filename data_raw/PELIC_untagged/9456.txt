Hi my name is Chia ANON_NAME_0. I come from Taiwan. In my country Chia means home and ANON_NAME_0 means great. I like static activities. I like to see the movies in my free time. I dislike the place where is full of people. Crowded occasions make me uncomfortable. This year I came to Pittsburgh in order to study English. I am studying at the University of Pittsburgh because my cousin's suggestion. I think Pittsburgh is a nice place. But the weather is the most different form Taiwan and I am always feeling cold here. There are many students from different countries in school. I am very glad to know everyone but I am bad at remembering people's name. So I am always forgetting someone's name. I hope when I ask what is your name you can be generous telling me again. Thank everybody.
