There are three kinds of my favorite television programs you can see in your house and on the internet. The first kind of my favorite televion programs is the Disney Channel . I watch it everyday. As soon as I wake up I turn on at television to study English. The conversation of Disney Channel is so easy to understand it. Also It is very educational as well as enjoyable. Movie Channel . For example I often enjoy watching movies through TNT channel. Although the conversation of TNT Channel is more difficult than Disney Channel I try to watch movies. Because I believe that these will help me to study English I have been watching it since I attived at Pittsburgh. The last kind is at Comedy Channel . It is related to reality. Also I always watch it on the internet. Learning English by watching television is co improve my skill and knowledge.
