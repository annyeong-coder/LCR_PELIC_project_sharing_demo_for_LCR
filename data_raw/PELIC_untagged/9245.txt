I have a lot of friends who come from different regions but there is one guy who is very unique named Kevin. Kevin is mixed Asian and American whose father comes from Vietnam and mother comes from America. He does not know how to speak Vietnamese but English. First I met Kevin at Michel birthday party for the first time. Michel is one of the girls who always gives me some sensible advice if I have met some obstacle that set me back. Kevin just likes Michel that they always make me feel comfortable when I am with them and also they correct my English from time to time if I say some vogue sentences or pronounce some words funny. Second after Kevin and I have been friends for over months I found out that Kevin who is a good looking guy does not have any girl friend in the past. After we have been getting along with each other I became enthusiastically to introduce some girls to him as a matchmaker which he did seem very interested in. Third I started wondering about Kevin's orientation. There are a lot of friends of mine are heterosexual or homosexual so which group Kevin goes to. Thus it surprisingly turned out that Kevin does not belong to those groups and then I just totally realized that he is an ASEXUEL which he admitted it after I politely asked him. Overall after I found out the truth I still like him as a friend. He is the man who does not like men or women but himself like a narcissist. Being a narcissist or asexual is not bad thing which makes me even more want to be friends with him forever because he has nice personality and special.
