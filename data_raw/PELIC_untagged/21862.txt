The worst meal experience that I ever have was one year ago in Pittsburgh. I had stomach problems and I wanted to eat something healthy and fresh. Actually I was looking for a salad. I try to have it in many places and believe it or not it was impossible. In a place the salads of the menu included sour cream bacon and potato chips. In other one they didn't have salads. In the next one they have salads with pasta and bacon. I just wanted a salad with some lettuce chicken breast and two or three kinds of vegetables. At the end I just have a glass of pop baked potatoes and a cup of tangerine ice cream.
