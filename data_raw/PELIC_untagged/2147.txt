A Successful Person A successful person in my mind is my mother because she is an independent and kind woman. Firstly she is very independent whether she is a boss or a mother. For instance she is a boss of trading company and she's owned this company for six years. When she established her business she didn't have anything to organize the business. Even though she has some troubles in her company she usually solves problems by herself. She is also a mother in my family and she takes care of my brother and me very well. When we studied at school she helped us to pay tuitions and gave us supplies. My father can't support her because he takes care of my grandmother. Besides she tries not to let her business interferes with our home life and takes care of us very well. I've never heard my mom said that she can't hold on everything between company and family. Hence my mother is a very independent woman because she can handle with everything by herself and she succeeds in her company and family. Secondly my mom is a very kind person because she thinks if we give more we can get more. She often donates gifts or money to charities and goes to hospital to serve patients when she has free times. She is happy when she receives some cards from people who have already got my mom's help. She is also kind to her employees. For example her employee's son has septicemia and he must live in hospital for a long time. My mom gave her employee some money to support her told her don't worry about job and she could come back to work until her son's situation is stable. My mother successfully helped her employee to pass difficult days. Therefore I'm so proud of my mother and that is why she is a successful person in my mind.
