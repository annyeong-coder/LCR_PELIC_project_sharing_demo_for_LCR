When I worked in my company. A person called me up about selling something. I didn't know him at all but he said that I had to buy it and he kept on talking me into purchasing it and did it over and over. So I heard his call number and hang up on him to talk over our company's attoney. As I talked to the attoney we turned out to confer with the police. The police thought it over and figured out how we dealt with this issue. The remedy was that the attoney called him back and stopped his calling based on the laws. Finally he realized his breach and stopped it after that. If you have a similar problem I recommend that you talk to the police as soon as possible. Don't cope with it by yourself.
