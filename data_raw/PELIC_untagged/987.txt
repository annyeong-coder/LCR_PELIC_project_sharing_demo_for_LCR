In my opinion Henry and Violet Crowley will be the best guardian for Victor's children for three reasons. First of all they will be more care about the children because they're their grandfather. Second I think they love children very much. Finally they have a good custody experience. I think ANON_NAME_0 is not a good guardian for Victor's children because he is unreasonable. Also Lydia will be not the best guardian for them because she didn't have any relationship with children. She is not their aunt.
