My room My room is important place to have relaxing and to think what the proper way to have fun in my life. In my room there are many ways to make my self relaxing. Example in the corner of the room there is a comfortable coach I like to use it when I tired and when I need to enjoy with reading stories or any books. At each corner there are speakers contact with main studio to listening the classic music. At front of the coach there is a big screen to see new movies specially comedian movies and to know the news specially the funny news. Next to the TV there is computer I like to use it every time because I like to be available or to be online most of time for sharing my pictures and videos to my friends example Face book You Tube and MSN messenger. All in all I spend most time to be relax and happy in my room. So my room is my life.
