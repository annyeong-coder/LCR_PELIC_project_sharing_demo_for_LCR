When I went to a chain grocery store with my Japanese friends a month ago I had a terrible experience. We just wanted to buy some meat so we went to the meat corner and asked. The salesclerk made fun of our English. If she can't understand our English she could have asked again politely. However she said to us just Speak English!I can't understand you We were speaking English also we were pointing the things we wanted. So she should have understood what we wanted. Although she said she could not understand us she picked up right things. She ought not to have said to us things like that. She should not have been rude to customers. She ought to have been nice to customers. She might have been mean to us.
