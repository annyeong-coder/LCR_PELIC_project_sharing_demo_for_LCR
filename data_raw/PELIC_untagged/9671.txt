The worst meal experience I have ever had was about two months ago. It was my friend's birthday and I reseved a table at a Chineese restaurant. The trouble started when we had our apatizers and I ordered the egg rolls and the smell was bad and it was not tasty as I thought it would. After that I got my main course which was sesami chicken. I disliked this plate so much because it had a lot of honey and I didn't finish my plates. I was embarassed and I didn't say anything in that night!
