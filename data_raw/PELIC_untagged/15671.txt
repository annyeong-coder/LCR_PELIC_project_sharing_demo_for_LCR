I was born in Colombia a beautiful country located in South America and surrounded by the Pacific and Atlantic Ocean. My country is full of exotic places where tourist can go and enjoy but many people are afraid to visit Colombia because it is famous for bad things like drugs violence and illegal groups. When I realize that people have these wrong ideas about my country I believe as Walter Lippman stated that stereotypes of social groups invariably prove incomplete and biased . I cannot deny that Colombia has some social problems but these ideas of Colombia are incomplete because we also have things worth seeing such as Tairona National Park San Agustin City Amazon Jungle etc. In addition my country produces one of the best coffees in the world and has a green gemstone called Esmeralda Emerald . Also Colombian people are categorized as smart educated and commitment people. Since I came to Pittsburgh I have talked about all the positive aspects of my country without denying the problems we have and I have gotten surprised because many people have been interested in knowing about Colombia. On the other hand I have to say that I had some stereotypes in mind about American People before I came to Pittsburgh. My experience studying in this city has showed me that these negative general ideas are not a complete reality of people in a society or country. When I came I thought that American people were cold and unfriendly but right now I think completely different about it. Finally do not take decisions in your life based only in negative stereotypes because you might be losing a lot of wonderful and amazing opportunities to meet people visit places or live experiences that can be incredible and can change your life.
