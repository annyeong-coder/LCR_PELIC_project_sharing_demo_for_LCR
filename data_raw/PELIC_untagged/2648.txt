Failing a test is the most easiest thing that you can do . First you don't have to take notes in class or listen to the instructor because he is a big mouth. If you want someday to do your homework take a nap it's better. During the week. You can go out with your friends and put your books away and don't think about the test make all your days weekends and you have to enjoy. Before the day of the test drive your car and visit all friends that you didn't see them since a long time and be friendly with people who need the help. I have on of my friends in my country like this I didn't see him all time except the test days. He remembered me and visit me and I told him many times I have a test I have to study and he said ok. Don't worry just one minute. Then we talk about 2 hours. I think this is a good example for you and you have to follow his steps. In the day of test it's a wonderful idea to be absent to miss the test. If you have to go to school you can go but don't do any thing good in the test because you might to pass it and this is a big problem. During the test take a piece of paper and draw any thing that you want trees birds or your teacher's face. Don't worry if you see your classmates work and you don't because you are special and they can't do what you do. After test go out and have fun. You have F. You're amazing person.
