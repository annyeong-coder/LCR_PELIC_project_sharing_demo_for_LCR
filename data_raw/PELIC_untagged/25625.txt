I like the sunlight let in my room. When I am in my room I sometimes turn on the light. But I turn it off in the morning. I don't like the drapes cover up the windows. And I straighten up my room when my friends come in my house. I also throw away the garbage. Nevertheless my table is messy when I am is studying. I put down the books anywhere in my room. But I clean them up before I go to bed. I suppose it is OK.
