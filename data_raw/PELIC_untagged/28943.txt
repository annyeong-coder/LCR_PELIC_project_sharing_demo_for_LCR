My childhood bedroom which I share with my sister was a little narrow. It had two single beds one bathroom and one desk. The bed where I slept was next to the window. My sister whom I shared the bedroom becomes my best friend. We still miss the nights when we talked for many hours. When we grew up and moved to another city my mother sold the desk which we spent hours studying for many years. My brother whose children are in elementary school wanted that desk for them. The bedroom where I grew up is now the guess room. My sister whose family has grown uses that bedroom every year in Christmas.
