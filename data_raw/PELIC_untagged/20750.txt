One day early morning 5 30am in my house my home phone was ringing. I suddenly woke up and picked up the phone. That time I was still in half sleep condition. The guy talked to me on the phone in Chinese. I was confused. After he talked to me in 10 minutes . I finilly figured out the man who spoke to me was my cousin. He just came from China and lived in downtown hotel in Pittsburgh. After I hang up the phone I put on my coat and drove to hotel to picked up him to my house.
