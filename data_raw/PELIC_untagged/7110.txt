I've already sent invitation cards to classmates. But my friend hasn't sent invitation card yet. So Have you bought some party stuff already I asked him. However He hasn't bought all of it yet. I was angry. And Haven't you understood yet I yelled Do you know what I'm saying What have you done already Frankly he hasn't done all of it yet. Otherwise I have already finished my business but haven't yet done preparing party. For example I've already bought some balloon but I haven't filled balloon with air yet. I need help to prepare party but my friend hasn't been a perfect condition yet.
