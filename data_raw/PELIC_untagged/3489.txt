July 4 2006 Dear ANON_NAME_0 I am thinking about buying a laptop and there are two laptops in my mind. The first one is DELL and the second one is HP. In my opinion DELL is better than the HP because DELL is cheaper. However HP have many features that I would like to be in my laptop. For example the HP costs 899 has 120 GB hard drive 1GB shared Dual Channel DDR2 memory 85 WHR Lithium LON Battery 9 cell and intel centrino Duo mobile technology plus wireless N mini card. On the other hand the DELL costs 599 has 80 GB hard drive 512 MB shared DDR2 memory internal wireless 802. 11B g and mobile AMD sempron technology 3500. That's all so what do you think Take care
