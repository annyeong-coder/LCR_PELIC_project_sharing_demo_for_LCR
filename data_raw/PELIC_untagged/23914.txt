The food in my country is not as same as the food in United States. For example the food in my country is healthier than the food in the United States because most of the food in my contry is homemade but here in the United States depend on restaurant eat. Therefore American food is more populer then my contry's food. Also American food is more expensive than the food in my country. In my country there is not tax as same as here in the United States.
