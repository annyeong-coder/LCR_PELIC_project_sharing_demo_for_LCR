I have an important friend in Taiwan. Three years ago when I got a job of my last company she was working in the same company. She was also my roommate and good friend and she tried to take care about me when we both worked in the same company. She was some kind of Big Sister to me and told me that If you have a dream you must to make the dream come true. And encouraged me to achieve my goal no matter what the other said That's why I'm here now I 'm studying English abroad and trying to get along with my classmates who come from different countries. Although sometime I feel upset when I can't speak and listen English well and I know that the vocabularies I know is not enough I always believe that is the right choice to be a international student in U. S.
