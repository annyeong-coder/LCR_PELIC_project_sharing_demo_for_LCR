I came to the United States this beginning of the year. I have been in Atlanta for seven months. I've been studying in English language institute since I came to the U. S. When I first came to the U. S. I was little bit disappointed at studying English because there are so many Koreans. Having not studied English very hard in Atlanta I couldn't improve my English a lot. However since I came to Pittsburgh I realized that I have to try hard. So I've been trying to study English hard. Although there is not enough time to study hard since I realized my fault I will try harder than I've done before.
