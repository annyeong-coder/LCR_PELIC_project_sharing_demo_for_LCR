It is a nice experience to live in another country. However it takes time to adjust to living there. When I came to the US I had a hard time to adapting to my new situation. There are three things that made my life miserable when I arrived here. First of all losing fortune when I arrived made me frustrated. My family and I spent about ten hours in New York airport because we had some problems. Actually my husband was filling out an application for four hours while my one year old daughter and I were looking for our luggage. Unfortunately I could not find three bags and my daughter stroller. Moreover my daughter has asthma and her inhaler was inside one of the bags which I had lost. Therefore my first impression was awful. Therefore this lack of luck in the beginning made me depressed. Second the diet in the US was a big problem for me. I did not use to eat fast food a lot in my country. Moreover when I came here I gained four pounds in two months. That means the US diet has more fat than what I had before in my regular diet. Subsequently I stopped eating fast food and tried to eat more healthy food such as salad and soup. Third family and friends are like water and air. They are essential substances to live. Missing and remembering them in the first three months were painful especially because my daughter was the first grandchild to my family. My parents kept calling me and told me how they missed her. Indeed having a lot of time without family or friends like living on the island a lone. All in all bad luck the different diet from what I used to and missing family and friends were big difficulties I have ever had before. Therefore I had not adjusted immediately. In my opinion living in a foreign country will take you a while to get used to adapt.
