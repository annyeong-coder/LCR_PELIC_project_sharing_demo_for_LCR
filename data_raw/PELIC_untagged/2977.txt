The weather in Pittsburgh is crazy The weather in Pittsburgh is crazy and very amazing in some times because of several reasons. I have been here in Pittsburgh for almost a year and I can tell why is that the weather is really crazy For example in the summer is the season that you might see a lot of rains show up some times in the morning the weather is hot and a little bit humidity and suddenly it's rain cats and dogs and I have been in this situation like for several times. I remembered once last summer when we were walking down to coffee shop. The weather was good and sunny we had our coffee in that coffee shop the weather has changed completely and its start to rain. For instance I was going to go buck home after my classes were finish and in five to ten minute the very dark clowdy came up in the sky and its start to rain a lot in that time I have to run a way to found place where I can covered myself from getting wet. In the winter we also can see how is the weather is very crazy and changeable too. Everybody remembered that day last two weeks ago which are a lot of schools was closed on and some of the Universities classes were canceled. Because of the weather had changed in about one hour to the bad snow and the very low temperature which is 0 was terrible. We can't move outside our homes. It was horrible day. Moreover two or three day's ago we were in the class and in the morning the weather was sunny and very beautiful day suddenly every thing had changed and it start to snow. Finally we could say that the weather is very crazy in Pittsburgh but I do like it.
