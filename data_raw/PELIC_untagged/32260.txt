before a month I moved to a new apartment. First I threw the old furniture away. Then I looked up for a new furniture on the internet. Next I went to the store to picked them up. After that I straightened up the apartment. This days I think I need some new decoration to make my room cheers me up at the morning. I need to hang up some new posters and l need to buy new lamp to light up the room. Also I think I need to move the bed around to have more area.
