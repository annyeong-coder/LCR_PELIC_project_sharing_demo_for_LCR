I like my room because it is very bright. I came home then turn on lamps. I found out that my one lamp has bright control function about four months ago. I used the lamp for six months. My room always cheers me up when I feel tired. I picked out my room's all items. My father made up a little bookcase for me. At that time I helped him out.
