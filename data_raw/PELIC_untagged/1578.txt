My job In June 2005 I was living in my country and I had a job in a library. One day I saw a job at university in newspaper. The job is a teacher assistant. The next day I went to the university and gave them my papers. After 2 weeks they called me and said I had an interview. I went to the university and I found about 5 persons who wanted to take a job. The interview was difficult and I thought I lost the job. After 3 weeks they called me again and said there was another interview. I went to the university again and it was easier than the first one. One month later the called me and told me I became a teacher assistant. It was difficult to me because I had two long months. When I remember it now I feel happy because I'm a teacher assistant now.
