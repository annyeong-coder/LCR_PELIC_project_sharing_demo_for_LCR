Last night I was trying to figure out what was the problem with my brother because the work gave him up. While we were discussing this issue the phone rang. I picked it up and directly I asked the caller to call me back after five minutes. The phone rang again. I answered but it was not clear because the TV volume was high for that I shouted to turn the TV down. The caller was an old friend who did not call since he moved to Kuwait. He told me that since he got the new job he has tried to sign up for the scholarship but he his application was turned down many times. I cheered him up . . Wake up wake up that was my mother was trying to wake me up.
