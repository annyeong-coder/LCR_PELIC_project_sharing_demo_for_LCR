Mikyoung should habe arrived at the american student's home after 7 00 because in the U. S. A it's kind of rude to get to the party earlier than the time of the invitation. So she could asked some other American students anout the costom in the U. S. A. However Maria should have visited earlier because the party could have been almost done.
