If you ask me which bedroom do I prefer between the one here in Pittsburgh and the one in my hometown I'll probably pick the one in my hometown out because of it's space. In fact my room in pittsburgh needs several changes. Some points are very awful and I'll probably fix them up. First of all this room is too small I need to tear down the wall and include the bathroom into my bedroom so I'll win some space. I also have a couple of strange pictures and art painting on the walls I'll take them down. I also need to light up this room because it's too dark at night and I can't really see in my books. I'll keep on the windows but surely remove my bed because sometimes I can get cold. I'll bring the television back and take a bigger one. There are some I don't really need to touch up the paint but this color is classical I want something new fresh and cool so I'll probably paint it into bleu. Now you know what I will do if I have the choice.
