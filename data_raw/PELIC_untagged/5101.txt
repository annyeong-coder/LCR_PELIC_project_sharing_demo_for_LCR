I have been interested in raising pets since I was a little girl. The pets I have raised including dogs one cat fish rabbits hamsters and guinea pigs. I was an irresponsible child. I always played with my pets but I didn't take care of them. Then my father forbade me to raise a pet for a long time. After I went to the high school my mother finally let me raise a pet again. I have bought two hamsters and dealt with all the things by myself. I also have been raising fish for five years before I came to United Sates. I have gotten the habit of being responsible to my pets and my father hasn't been restricting me anymore after that.
