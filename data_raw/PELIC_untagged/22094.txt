The day when I met my best friend it was at a soccer field. His name is Diag's. There was a competition and my team was playing against his team. I was playing as a striker and he was playing as a defender. When the match started he was trying to upset me but I was not afraid. After ten minutes he tripped me and I fell down and broke my arm. My brother took me to the hospital. While we were going to the hospital I was crying of pain and also that arm had been broken before that. The next day while I was celebrating my birthday and he came with his parents and asked me to forgive him. Since then we became best friend and he came to see me everyday until my arm cured. Our parents registered us in the same school and we were taking the same classes until we graduated from high school. The day when I got my visa and he got his too however we didn't come the same day to U. S
