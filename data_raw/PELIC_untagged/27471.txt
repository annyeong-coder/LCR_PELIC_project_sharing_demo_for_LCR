My hometown is China which was located in Asia which is connected to Europe. People in my country all have black eyes and hair are very friendly and kind. In our most important festival Spring Festival people eat dumpling a kind of traditional Chinese food. My favorite dumpling is beef dumpling made of beef onion and some other sauces. Another famous traditional food in my country is beef noddles which made of beef as well but have totally different flavor with beef dumplings. Soup in the noddles is pretty yummy. I always recommend my foreign friends to try it. A great place I want to talked about is Great Wall a famous ancient structure built thousands years ago. It is a unbelievable work which had done by ancient people without any technological tool. If you visit China you should visit the Great Wall.
