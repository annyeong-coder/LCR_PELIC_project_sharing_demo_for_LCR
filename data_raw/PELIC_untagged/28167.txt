A friend in need is a friend indeed. Yes it's true. My friend is a person who helps me whenever I need to. For example When I decided to move to Pittsburgh one of my best friends helped me finding a great apartment. However that's an example for a good friend. An acquaintance is a person who knows a little bit information about you. My classmates is an example for that. They all know my name but they don't know something else about me. Also an acquaintance is a person who doesn't care about me if I need some help. Because he just knows a general information about me.
