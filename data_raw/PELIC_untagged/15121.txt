One of my hobbies is playing soccer. Since I have been in Pittsburgh I have been going to the Korean church. There is a soccer team in the church. In every Sunday I have played soccer with church people. In the last weekend we played soccer at the Cost Sports Center. I have preferred playing the soccer since I was young. When I was a freshman I joined the soccer team of my university. My team won many competitions in Pohang. I learned about cooperation through it. After that the soccer has become an important part of my life.
