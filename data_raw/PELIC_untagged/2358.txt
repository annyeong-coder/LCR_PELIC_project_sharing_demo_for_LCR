I watched ' Hitch' with my friend in my apartment. Will Smith acted the main character in this movie. He had been working as an adviser of love. In his school days he had turned down by his girlfriends twice. After that he decided to be a love adviser because he wanted people not to have same experiences. He started his job in NY and he gave some advices for many people. One day he met the woman at the bar and he fell in love. He promised a date with her. At his first date he accidentally kicked her face when riding a water bike. In addition at second date when they were eating dinner he got a nettle rash in his face because he had a food allergy. One day problem was happened. People started to think that hitch was tricking other people to become in love. Finally when his girl friend knew the truth about hitch they fell in love.
