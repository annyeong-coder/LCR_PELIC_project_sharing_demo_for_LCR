The View From My Window The view from my window is the thing that makes me the happiest in my apartment. First on the right side there are two big trees which move in wind and make me enjoyed when I look at it. If you look around the trees you will see many small flowers with different colors which looks like many people talking together. Second in the center you can see Mellon Areana where you can see thousends of people who come everyday to watch hockey games with many cheers which make me the happiest. Also on the left side there are many skyscrapers with different shapes and colors with beautiful lights which help me to be more comfortable. Finally the sky rains everyday to clean all these things and that makes me feel the happiest.
