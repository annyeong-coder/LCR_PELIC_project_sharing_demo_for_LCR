Dear Megan Hi I am ANON_NAME_0 Ha. I am very happy to meet you in Pittsburgh. In Korea my knowledge about English is terrible. So I couldn't read my major book and I couldn't talk about anything with my professor. My parents let me go U. S. A. For my future. I really want to be good at English. I will do my best. Thank you
