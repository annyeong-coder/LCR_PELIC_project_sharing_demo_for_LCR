I have some friends who have a different type of character and personality. One of my best friends Satoko is someone who is positive always cares about me and encourages me everytime to start new things or to have a hung up over my future. She is also someone who points out my good points which even I didn't realize. As for another best friend ANON_NAME_0 she is someone whose taste on everything is tha same as mime so it's very comfortable for me and I can relax to be with her as if I'm with my family. However she's never influence on me and we don't discuss about our concernings or futures very much. They are very different type of my friends but there is similarity that they are clam like me and smart so they are my best friends whom I respect.
