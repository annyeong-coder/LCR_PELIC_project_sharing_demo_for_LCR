There was a Halloween party last Saturday and I was thinking going or not because I did not want to go by myself so I was waiting for my boyfriend to get off fom his work. I should have not waited for my boyfriend because it was really late. At that time my friend just called me to come because there were so much fun. Thus I decided to go by myself and took bus. Unfrontunately I was so late for that party so they ate all the foods. I should have left early because there were so much traffic. I could have told my boyfriend about this party early and that he could get off that day. I will think correctly next time if there are having a party.
