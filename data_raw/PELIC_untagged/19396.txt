Last friday I and my friend decided to go to Southside to have a dinner and watch a movie. Before we got there I told them I am going to ASSESS the movies and choose one or two. I told them there is two nice movies one is Inglourious Basterds featuring Brad Pitt one is Surrogates featuring Bruce Wills. After we had dinner and had a little discussion for which one we were going to watch we had PARALLEL ideas and bought tickets for Inglourious Basterds. It's CONCEPT is historical 2. World War aslo UNDERLYING Nazi Hitler time. After a while 2 friends of mine got bored at the movie and went outside to smoke. But they didn't come back waited us at outside. I was ANTICIPATING the movie is so good beacuse it was directed by Quantin Tarantino. Anyway lesson learned next time I am not going to be the one who choose the movie.
