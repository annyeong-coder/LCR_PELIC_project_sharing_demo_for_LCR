It is alleged that ghosts live in the desert. They are not seen by anybody except animals. Dogs donkeys and sheeps sounds are believed to be the indication of their presence. It's claimed that wolves is the only animal that can attack the ghosts. It is thought that ghosts fear wolves as once the ghosts are seen by wolves they freez in their place until the wolves stop staring at them. Beside this ghosts are considered the food that wolves choose in case they could not find other kinds of food to consume.
