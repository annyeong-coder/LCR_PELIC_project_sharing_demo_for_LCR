It emerged that the accident of the flying balloon with a little boy which got people's attention until the hidden boy was found in his house was just a hoax. The parents the Heenes are going to have criminal liability and are doubted custody of their children. They have denied the perpetrating the framework of the fake but the sheriff Alderson said that the Heenes was hoping to be in a trendy reality show. Alderson initially believed that the accident was genuine but Falcon said the event was for the TV show. The investigators tried to lure them into confessing until they cannot justify for the sensational happening. After all the accident was too weird to believe in.
