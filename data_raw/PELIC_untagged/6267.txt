My room is usually a little messy so it bring me down when I came back my room from school. On my desk there are some books that I took out pens and notebooks. I rarely arrange these stuff before I go to bed. Also I don't have enough time to srtaighten these things up. Therefore it make me cheer up to clean my room. When I am cleaning my room I usually don't let anyone in my room like my mom or my sister. During cleaning I throw trash on my desk away and set my desk up. Also I hang up my clothes that are on my sofa and get my stuff back. Actually I dislike to clean my room before I grew up. However I have figure out what neat room make me cheer up. So thesedays when someone put me off I often clean and arrange my room such as move my furniture around or put new blankets on the furniture.
