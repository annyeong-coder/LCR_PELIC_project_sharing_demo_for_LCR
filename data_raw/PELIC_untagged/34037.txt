I consider that the most effective way to market a product is to create its band awareness. Generally people have got to know the products before they buy them. In addition it should be successful in marketing that the products can come to the costomers' mind when they need something like these. Likewise people will choose the products that they heard sometimes when they shop. Therefore advertising is a good method to market a product because it can create the band awareness. For example Coca Cola puts its advertisements everywhere. As a result when people want to consume some soft drinks they usually disregard other band and only choose Coca Cola.
