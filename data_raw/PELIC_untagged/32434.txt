First year in college I took summer classes and my family traveled to another city. After I finished summer classes I decided to follow them. While I was driving I forgot fill my car by fuel so the car stopped in the road. The nearest gas station is about 20 miles. What surprised me about my situation the police didn't come after I called. I have to wait 2 hours until someone help me. Then I continued my trip. During trip I felt sleepiness but I decided to continue. After 100 miles I made an accident because I was sleeping. After the police came he towed my car because I didn't have insurance. To get my car back I went to an insurance company and I subscribed. Only in Saudi Arabia can people who wear traditional clothes enter governments building. Because I was wearing sport clothes police building's securities didn't let me in. I have talked with the police officer to bring my bag from my car to change my clothes but he refuted my order. I called my friend in that city to bring traditional clothes. Finally I got my car and told my friend to repair. After that I went to the bus station and took the first trip. How long I spent to arrive to my family is unbelievable.
