Friend is a small word with big heart. I think that the place in which you can find friends is everywhere but someone who has a real friend is very lucky because you meet many people in every single place but you don't know if that friend who you met in one minute can give you a chance to meet friendship or just be someone else in the world. The real meaning that describes the real friend is very long here I'm going to say some characteristics important for me. A friend is someone who made you feels better in the moments which you don't want to live someone who helps you in problems which you don't have solutions someone that divide the sadness and multiplies the happiness. A friend is someone who makes you rich someone who tells you the truth for your own benefit. The person who has the friendship's richness is someone who has a treasure which gives you the opportunity of looking the life in other way.
