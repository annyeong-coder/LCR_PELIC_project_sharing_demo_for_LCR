When I was a child I used to be thin. Since I was young I have become heavy. When I was young I hoped to have my own car. Since then I have had my own car. When I was a child I dreamed to have a baby. Now I have had children. When I was young I hoped to visited the US. Now I have lived in the US. When I was young I was single. Now I have gotten married.
