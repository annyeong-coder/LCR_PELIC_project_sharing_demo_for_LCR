As a Saudi student who has been living in the U. S. A for a year I find Pittsburgh is a good place to live. Pittsburgh is one of the most biggest cities in the U. S. A. Pittsburgh has many irresistable places that people can visit such as the Water front and the Pittsburgh Zoo. Pittsburgh has one of the oldest Universities in the world and it offers many majors such as statistics math and many other majors. I chose Pittsburgh for three main reasons because of an entertainment reason educational reason an economy reason.
