I have been In Miami Florida two years ago with my family and it was the perfect place to enjoy a summer vacation. While I am staying now in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania I can easily distinguish the differences and the similarities between these two cities. First of all Miami is located in southeastern Florida while Pittsburgh is located in northwestern Pennsylvania. Therefore the weather differs in each city. In Miami people can enjoy their time going to the beach and having fun. On the contrary Pittsburgh doesn't have a beach only rivers and the weather isn't warm like in Miami. Moreover Miami has a lot of skyscrapers and new bulidings while in Pittsburgh you can easily notice the old buildings. Despite the diffrences these two cities have something in common when it comes to history and economy. Both of the the cities have so many museums and a lot of companies that cares about busniess and commerce. In addtion music plays such a great role in both of the cities people can go to broadways and there is also many music festivals.
