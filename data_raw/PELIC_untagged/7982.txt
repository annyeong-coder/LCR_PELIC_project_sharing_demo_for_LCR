I have been in Pittsburgh for 16 months. Although I have lived in a quiet suburb of Pittsburgh I have felt that the city overall has been very quiet and clean. And the city surrounded by rivers has looked like my hometown. When I enjoyed the dinner cruising last summer I remembered going to the Thames cruising in London 4 years ago. Atmosphere in the city has always let me remember England.
