It is always cheap to talk about the things we don't have an experience. We can only express an opinion about the things we haven't have or live like what is the difference between life with a baby and without. For some people it might sound how can hard it is but according to my observation on my near surroundings life totaly change when a couple have a baby. Initially the couples who are having a baby forget the meaning of the word of 'freedom' day by day. Because life totaly changes when you are responsible for a little helpless baby. Sleeplessness is the first suprise for the new life. Waking up many times in the middle of the night is the first thing for the couple have to face to face. But without having a baby you can have a sound sleep how many hours you want. Having a responsible for feeding the baby and other necessary things take so much time than you can guess. But life a without a baby you can do what ever you want the time you want. A baby means a new budget. Because there are many necessities for the baby. Clothes nappies health care babysitter are some examples for the extra budget you have to have. But without a baby you are only responsible for your self and your necessities.
