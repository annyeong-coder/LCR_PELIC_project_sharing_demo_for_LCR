Sammy and I are brothers but we are different in many ways. For one thing Sammy is taller than me and he is thinner than me. I am the heaviest of us. In other side Sammy is more serious than me. Sammy is as married as me and he is as fatherly as me. The biggest family is mine because he has not the children as number as me. I think I am a stronger than him only in this point because in another side Sammy is the richest. I am not as rich as him. He is more professional than me in engineering projects.
