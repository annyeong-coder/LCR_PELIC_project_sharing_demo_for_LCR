Downloading and sharing music off the Internet Some people may thought that downloading and sharing music off the Internet make no influences on authors as long as authors didn't get a pay for it. In other words there are not any negative results for each person involved. I realized that it is impossible for everyone to buy as many music disks as they want these disk are expensive but it can't be denied that downloading music off the Internet without paying is illegal. If everyone downloaded music off the Internet authors would lose their job owing to their no incoming. As a result the music industry will come to an end. No one want to create new music. Consequently downloading music off the Internet could cause seriously damage to both of customers and providers.
