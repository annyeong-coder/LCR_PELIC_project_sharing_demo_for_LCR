Winning lottery has had several important effects on my life. If I won 30 600 000 dollars previously I would like to travel all over the world with my boyfriend. Because we are young we have a potential for our future. We need enough experience it would be valuable for our future. For example when we travel to Europe we can get to know ancient culture in western country. I think spending money to trip is worthy for knowledge or background in our future. After then I would prefer to donate my collage and church. It would be helpful for them. The money which won from the lottery is just luck so I should spend it other people rather than only me. For instance when I offered a big money as my department's scholarship I would be famous person in my collage. It makes me be happy. Also I would like to have a fancy party with all of my friends and family. I am assisted by my family and my friends. They always encourage me mentally also they help me anytime. I think it is my debts for my whole life so I should have a luxury party for them. I provide fancy meals drink and small gifts. When I have a party we can enjoy eating food listening to music and talking each other. I really want to be held a very nice party for my familiar people. In conclusion there are several effects on winning lottery such as traveling all over the world donating my collage and having a fancy party.
