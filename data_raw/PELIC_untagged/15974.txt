Contrast the Benefits of Group Study and Individual Study One problem I had coming into ELI was learning how to study efficiently. Although I had tried both learning style one is a group study another is an individual study. For the over past two months I still couldn't make up my mind. It was only after I analyzed the differences between the benefits of group study and individual study reveals some surprising differences. First of all one great benefit of group study is that the many perspectives can learn from others. American Psychological Association. 2006 Groups perform better than the best individuals at solving complex problems APA press release. The group study will always bring up thoughts you had never considered therefore more efficient at solving problems. In addition the benefits of group study are less work than individual study. To illustrate for academic writing assignments for each group is required to write a five paragraph essay. However if divide into a group number only need to write two paragraph per person.
