I believe that my older sister is typically extrovert. She is the person who likes to work outside and go out. She has been continuing her job which she got just after graduated from a college. She is not only teaching English at a junior high school but also taking care of a club activity so she is very busy. She lives in the house where we sisters grew up. My mother usually helps her housework. She seems to dislike housework very much. On holidays she often goes out with her husband and her daughters. I used to be very surprised when I saw her cooking a big meal. She sometimes invited the teaching assistants some of whom spoke only English. I can not imagine of a time when she has no job and stays at home every day.
