The best solution is to make money first. He has alternatives to borrowing money from bank or selling the present restaurant and renting a new cheaper restaurant. If he makes money he can do these things such as hiring professional cook serving special dishes and an advertisement. First he can hire a professional cook instead of students. The most important feature of the restaurant is food. The student cook can't make good food. Second he can serve special dishes. Because there are so many restaurants around his restaurant if he has no distinct dishes with other restaurants many customers will go to other restaurants. Third he can do advertisement. If he does advertisement of the restaurant students around the restaurant will notice the restaurant and they will bring more friends or family to there. If he makes money he will be able to those things and his restaurant will be success.
