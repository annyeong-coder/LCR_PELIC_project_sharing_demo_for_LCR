Music is a piece of our life. First of all I want to write music and music benefits . Some music help us to be relax. But some music made us a sorrowful. I always prefer to listen to pop music. Because when I listen to pop music I feel very relax. I can forget my problems. Then music is a nutrition of our soul. Some people listen to music which has obscene meaning and very loudly. I think this music is harmful for their soul and hears. Furthermore music helps us to keep feet. When we listen to music we can dance as an exercise. We can lose calories. Finally our soul bady and feelings need to listen to music.
