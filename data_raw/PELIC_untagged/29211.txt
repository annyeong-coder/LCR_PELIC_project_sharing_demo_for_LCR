There is debate about the necessity to travel to the country where a language is spoken in order to truly learn the language. When someone travels to the target language country the only way to communicate with people is to speak their languages and that results in more practice. In addition he'll learn from native speakers so there is no fear of learning it incorrectly. Living in an environment that is completely surrounded by the target language is strongly beneficial for the learner. A learner can't speak his native language because people won't understand him therefore he must try to speak their language. People everywhere speak the target language and that will enhance the learner's listening skills. I've studied the English language in my country for more than one year but I achieved more benefits in the united states in just five months. Learning the target language from native speakers guarantees true pronunciation. I've learned English vocabulary words by myself and now I'm facing difficulties to correct those vocabulary words' pronunciation. Also students study new vocabulary words at school and he listen them from people so that makes him remember their pronunciation. This is happening with me now. It's true that some institutes in different countries when they teach a foreign language provide native speakers as teachers and students can learn as if they are traveling abroad to learn. However It's only one benefit. In contrast student is forced to learn speak and listen to the target language from native speakers. In conclusion there is no doubt that learning speaking listening to a language where it's natively spoken is more beneficial than learning it in a non native speaking country.
