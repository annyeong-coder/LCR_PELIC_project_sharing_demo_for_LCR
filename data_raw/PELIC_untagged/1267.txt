The biggest environmental problem in my country is the air pollution. In the last twenty five years many factories were built especially in my region. The problem is that most of these factories are for petrol and when the factories deg out the petrol a gas comes out with it and the factories split the gas from the petrol however they do not need the gas so they burn the gas in the air. Many cities located near to these factories. This problem has already caused too many farms to disappear.
