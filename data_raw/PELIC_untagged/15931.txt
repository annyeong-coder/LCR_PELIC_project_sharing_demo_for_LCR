A major targeted consumer of junk food is the child. As we know junk food is not good for our health but junk food restaurants such as McDonalds and ANON_NAME_0's are very popular today because many kids like toys found in junk food packaging. Junk food manufacturers should not be allowed to advertise their products to children. Advertising can stimulate children's desire to eat junk food more often because they see it many times a day. Even though we know that parents should give some advice to their offspring which food is good or bad parents can't control children's minds. Sometimes when kids see commercials that encourage them like if they buy food will get free toys. For example my younger brother when he saw McDonalds commercials that launched new toys collection he always begs me to buy McDonalds happy meal for him because he needed a toy. Moreover they don't care about that food is good or bad they just want to get free toy. When children eat junk food over and over again it affects their health. As a result the number of overweight children in my generation is higher than in the past. In conclusion junk food manufacturers should not be allowed to advertise their product to children because it's bad for their health. If junk food manufacturers want to advertise their product they shouldn't allow advertising during children TV programs or they can advertise after 10 pm. Because at that time most kids have already gone to bed.
