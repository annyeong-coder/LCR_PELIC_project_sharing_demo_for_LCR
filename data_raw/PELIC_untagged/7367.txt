What does Islam Say about Terrorism Islam is a religion of mercy it doesn't permit terrorism under any circumstance. The terrorism at these days became wider. It is unfairly that many people implicate the Islam for terrorism and consider the Islam responsible for all events that related to terror. The Islam usually tries to end the violence at any where. Sanctity of Human life Islam declares that killing another human being is a crime against humanity. Islam respects human life and it considers the human life is sacred. Quran says if any one saved the life of any person it would be as if he saved the life of the whole people. On the other hand if any one killed any person that like if he killed all people. Ethics of War It tells us that even in war Muslim soldiers are not to kill women children and even non combatant men. They are not even to destroy trees. Muslims are even encouraged to be kind to animals and are forbidden to hurt them. Misconceptions of Jihad The word Jihad means struggle. The Quran is very clear that the believers must defend themselves but never ever to aggress. It is true that Islam wants Muslims to be strong to use this strength to secure peace provide freedom for the society and the country but never to aggress.
