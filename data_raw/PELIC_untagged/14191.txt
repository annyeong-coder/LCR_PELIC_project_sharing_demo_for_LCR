Here's an old saying that I found is the best mirror is an old friend. In Korea we talk about this many times. Especially the people who have children the parents tell their sons or daughters this old saying. When I was a child I didn't like to here it which I mentioned above from my mom because I thought that she was making the judgments to my friends. However I realized that my mom who always concerned me tried to protect me from the bad affects. If I got along with the friends who didn't like to study probably I could be just like them. Therefore when I saw this old saying I couldn't agree with it more.
