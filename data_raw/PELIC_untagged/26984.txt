Hi I've lived in Pittsburgh for 2 years. I had been living in Japan since I was born. In Japan I had been working at pharmacy. My family often went to the beach. When I was a child I was a member of swimming class. I've been studying English at ELI and I've also been learning how to drive since I came to Pittsburgh. I have never driven before I came here. I have been quilting during my free time.
