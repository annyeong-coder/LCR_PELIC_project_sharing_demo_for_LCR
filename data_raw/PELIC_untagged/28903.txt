I remember carefully the day when I graduated it was so great and I was full of energy. However I sat home without working for two years. My major in Bachelor is English literature so as a second language for me I should have practiced speaking English without stopping. Actually I did not do that so I forgot a lot of what I studied. I should not have done that because when I did not practice I lost every thing I learned. If I did I might not lose all my hard work at the university. I should have worked anywhere even if the work is a volunteer. Also I should have spoken with a native speakers I should not be embarrassed. It could have helped me if I did that. Now I regretted for every minute I spent without doing any thing. I could have spoken fluently and I could have entered a university and completed my Master degree.
