Mona Lisa Smile directed by Mike Newell is one of the movies I saw recently. The movie staring Julia Roberts brings a big change to women's way of life. ANON_NAME_0 ANON_NAME_1 played by Julia Roberts is a main character and teaches the history of art at Wellesley College in Massachusetts a conservative women's private liberal arts college where Hillary Clinton graduated. She wants to make difference encouraging her students to study to become career professionals and not just to live as the wife of somebody using traditional and modern arts. Her teaching method an example of which is feminism is not accepted by school's directors based on conservative tradition that is ideal women are marrying and being wise wives. All students feeling bored her first class can answer all of her questions for which they already read entire textbook so they leave the class on their way. However ANON_NAME_1 becoming more forceful in her speeches never changes her policy. Her humanity emotion and heartwarming consideration for which more students begin to admire her little by little influence Betty married and Joan divorced to make decision to study law both of whom she suggested to go to Yellow School which is a law school. When ANON_NAME_0 from California leaves the campus after one year her students show their affection following her car by each bicycle reaching the climax of the movie. I like the location in campus old traditional fashions they wear and Mona Lisa smile acted by characters all of which make success this movie.
