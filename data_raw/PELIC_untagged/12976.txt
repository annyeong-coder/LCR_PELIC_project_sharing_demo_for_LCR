I am fortunate that I can live in a room of my parent's friend whose house is not expensive but is very comfortable and has three floors. She offered me a good room which has many advantages. One advantage is that there is a French window and the view is very beautiful. There are many beautiful trees flowers and little animals. Another advantage is that the house which I live is near the bus stop where I can achieve there just 30 seconds. I like this house ans I think I am very lucky to live in this house.
