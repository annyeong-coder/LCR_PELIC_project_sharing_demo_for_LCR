Why the parent want their children to get A or high score in the class I am the one that my mother wants me to get high score too. My mother always teaches me to study more than do activity. I was a kid who has to extra study after school. On the way I think this is an important thing for my parent. Due to my parent I have to hard work for studying and made it better if I can. There are three causes of getting good grades such as make proud of my parent get good job and accumulate into my own life. First of all I love my parent too much so I want to study much as I can.
