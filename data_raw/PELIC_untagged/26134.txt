If I go to an island I should want to take a knife a flashlight and a tent. All of them are necessary for me. For example when I pick some fruits from the tree I can cut them with a knife and I have to protect myself from wild animals. The knife may help me protect myself from wild animals. Of course I must take a flashlight. I can use it for light at night time and I think I have got to take a tent so I can stay in the tent safely.
