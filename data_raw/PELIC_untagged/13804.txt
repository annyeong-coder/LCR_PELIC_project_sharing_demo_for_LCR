It is very important for people to eat Home cooked food. That is because it will be fresh well prepared and usually large amount. Also home cooked food is usually less expensive and tastier than the food that cooked outside the home. In addition to that at home you can make the traditional food which is very delicious. On the other hand the outside cooked food is to some extent is important especially those people who work all the day. And there are disadvantages of the outside cooked food like fast food which may cause obesity. Also some times may be not very clean because they do it very fast and may lead to quit bad gastric upset or diarrhea or other diseases. That is why I prefer the home made food than the outside made food. Thank you
