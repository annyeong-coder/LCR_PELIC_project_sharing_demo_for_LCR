If I don't have money I still want to travel to all over the world. Because of no object I need to make a plan. Combine with other to make a group can save a lot of money. Otherwise group activity always have much fine than single action. Secondly I need to chose time. Searching on the web first to chose what time is the best to visit some place in order to see the most beautful scenery. In a nother way to travel all over the world without money I should learning skills to find jobs in everywhere to make money. Working is the best way to know one place's culture.
