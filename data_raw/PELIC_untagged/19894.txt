Everywhere you can see them not one or two of them but many of them are living in the streets and parks. I dislike watching these people suffering from this problem. This problem is not their problem but it is our problem too. How can be that I would like you to understand me I begin explaining my idea I want you to know everyone in this world has the same our blood our feeling and our air to breathe. It is clear to you my view let us to change this direction and I need you to do this you must avoid discussing it now I advise you to do it! Probably you can not allow our self to do this. I can not miss feeling these people. I look forward to helping them. It is bad at continuing our mistakes. We are likely to be as wild animals if we don't mind solving this problem.
