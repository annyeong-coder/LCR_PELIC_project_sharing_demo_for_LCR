Recently what shocked me was the sad ending of Korean sitcom high kick through the roof. I have watched that sitcom with much of interest because it helped me overcome homesickness. What made me laugh was that sitcom. However I was shocked that the two of main characters died in the last scene of the last episode by car accident. I could not believe that the main characters could die in a comic sitcom. Even some people who didn't want to believe that ending insisted that the girl was a ghost. What made me more depressed was both of them were so young and had dreams of the future. The fact that the girl who has secretly loved the guy finally confessed her feeling to him then a few minute later they died was the saddest point. Also it is difficult to say whether they would love each other if they didn't die because we viewers don't know how he felt about that girl. However the fact that I felt sorry about the guy's death more but my husband felt sorry about the girl's death more was interesting.
