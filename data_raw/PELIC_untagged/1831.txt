Focusing in vocabulary is important way to improve your skills in English. For people who are taking or studying English as a second language are not easy for them to learn or handle it right a way because it might be the English language is completely different than their own language. However I think to handle that you should focus your time in the vocabulary to improve your skills in English for every way that facing you. For example if you are going to study in academic classes you need to know a lot of words to help you understand most of things during the lecture. In addition there are a lot of places having their own words or vocabulary which require knowing these to make your self be comfortable while you are talking for something you're not familiar with it. Even you don't know some words because you heard it for first time it's fine for you as a second learning because it's hard for you to know all the vocabulary but you can understand it if you want to by asking about it or find it out. In fact each language has their own vocabulary and to let speak by this language you have to know these words or vocabulary. More over in my opinion for who want add a lot of vocabulary in his mind I think she or he has to read a lot or try to talking with native speaker to gain some new vocabulary. So knowing as much as you can vocabulary helps you success you skills in English.
