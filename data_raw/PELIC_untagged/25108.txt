My name is ANON_NAME_0 I born in jeddah Saudi arabia. When I was a child I stayd in my family house. When I was 7 we moved to Riyadh city. I studied in King ANON_NAME_1 school for 5 years I graduated from King ANON_NAME_1 school after that my dad planned me to study in U. S. A at the first I was confused and sad. My family were convincing me to study in U. S. A to be seccefull in my life and get a good job and learn english though. So im in U. S. A and im enjoing studying Englis accually everyday I call my father and thank him because he sent me to study in america.
