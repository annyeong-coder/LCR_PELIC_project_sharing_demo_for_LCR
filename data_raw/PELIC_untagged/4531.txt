I would choose the present because I really want to live in the present. People have good memories of the past or big dreams of the future. Someone might want to change the past when they regret a moment from the past. Someone might want to skip to the future because they want to avoid suffering something in the present. It may be that most people think that the past or the future is more valuable than the present. However I prefer the present. One reason I feel this way is that I never regret my past behavior. Because of my faults in the past I am more mature today. My past has been a good experience for me. I don't want to break from my past faults just learn from my mistakes. Second I want to choose my own future. If a time machine really exists I can go into the future someday. Jumping into the future means that I might miss the experience of living out the present. Furthermore I don't want to give up future good memories or even some bad memories. The third reason that I want to live in the present is that I don't want to be comfortable with the past's glory. A couple of years ago I read an article about ANON_NAME_0 Mourinho who is a Chelsea football manager. Whenever he wins a medal related to a football championship he throws the medal to the spectators. One sports journalist wondered about this action so he asked him about his behavior. A championship medal is one of the most valuable honors in your life why did you throw away it Mourinho said The past is the past. That's it. I already finished that. If I stick to the past I can't extend my ambitions. I'll just do my best right now. While I was writing my homework assignment I remembered reading this article I thought about many things writing this assignment and I feel this way learn from the past work hard in the present and look forward to the future with optimism.
