According to this article English seen as co star among global language multilingualism is gradually increasing and this phenomenon is natural and inevitable in much of the world. This common multilingualism is showed in the United States by the fact that nearly one of five peoples is using another language at home instead of English. This multilingualism makes other countries choose English as the second language because English is important and strong in international relation. From the graph on page 38 other language speakers will surpass English. Graddol thinks that Mandarin will be the new must learn language in the next decade. It means that the dominant language might be changed because the diversity of language will develop. This domination of some language causes 90 of 6 000 or so languages to be a possibility for extinction. So this writer support argument made in the first article about extinction of local language. However this situation is not an intentional purpose but a natural need. This writer show examples and graph to explain and support his thinking about English as the second language in the world. Even though the share of people in the world who are native English speakers has been decreasing the second language speaker with English will increase because the global share of English is much larger. So English will keep as international language. The common thinking from both of articles is closely related to the extinction of minority language. This widely used language causes minority language to have a danger in extinction of language even though this is not being done on purpose. In my opinion the second article is more persuasive. Because the second's writer shows several examples mentioned by professional peoples and provide the graph so it is very understandable for me to read this article.
