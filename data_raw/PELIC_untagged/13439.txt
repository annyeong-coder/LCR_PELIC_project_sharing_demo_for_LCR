I used to live in Japan. When I was a child I used to play outside. In holiday I used to go to an amusement park with my parents and my brother. When I was a student I didn't use to study well. Because I used to join a club. After I graduated at junior college I used to work at the bank. So I used to get up at 6 30a. M. On weekdays. And I used to eat out after work. On weekend I used to go a movie theater. Today I am living in U. S. I study English well. But I don't work. So I get up late everyday. Also I hardly eat out because I cook almost everyday. I haven't been to a movie theater after I came to U. S.
