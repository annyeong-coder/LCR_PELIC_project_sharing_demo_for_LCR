Corruption is one of the most controversial issues not only in the local area but also all around the world. Most of country has regulated strongly this problem but some people think this is an important aspect for doing politic such as having relationship between politicians and CEOs or pursuing someone who disagrees with their policies. However I think that this kind of consciousness should be thrown away and we don't have to do the corruption over for making better cleaner and fairer society. Corruption can be bribery an irrational relationship between politics and economy or overly acting political power to people for their interest. It's very difficult to know how we can decide whether corruption or not.
