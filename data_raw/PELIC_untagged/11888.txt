In many countries they have had a serious problem of disposing of garbage because the amount of garbage has been increasing everyday but there is a limited space to take care of it. It might not be a severe problem right now but if we just let it go it is going to be worse in the near future. So we need to focus on the solution of this problem. The easiest and the most effective way of dealing with garbage is separate garbage collection. We can categorize garbage by matter such as paper bottle plastic and food. If we practice it well natural products can be produced in different usage. For example paper is changed into paper bag notebook tissue and soap. Also rotten food can be natural compost. All things are made of natural materials so it is not harmful for the body. Shortly recycling helps us cut back on unnecessary consumption and keep environment safety.
