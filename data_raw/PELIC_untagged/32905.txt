English is a modern language. Most researches are written with English so most people need to improve their English especially in writing field. For me I want to improve my writing skills for three reasons. The first reasons why I want to improve my writing skills is that I must pass the TOEFL test. When I applied to University of Pittsburgh for masters they requested me 80 scores in the TOEFL test. The TOEFL test includes for parts and one of them is writing so I need to improve my writing to pass the TOEFL test. The second reason is to write master's thesis. Most students who want to graduate of a school must write thesis so if you want to write a good thesis you should be a good writer and that why I want to improve my writing. The final reason why I want to improve my writing skills is that it is to understand everything that I read. Students of masters always read articles. People who write the articles are academics. They studied a lot of materials in writing field to be capable of writing articles so I should improve my writing to understand the articles. To sum up I would like to improve my writing skills is to pass the TOEFL test which is required to get acceptance at school write thesis of graduation and understand everything I read.
