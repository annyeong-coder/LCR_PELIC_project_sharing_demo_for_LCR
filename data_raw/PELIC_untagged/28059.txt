My definition of acquaintance is that a person who I know but not well such as schoolmate who is not classmate or a person who talks with me only things which are essential for getting along with each other. I'll recognize a person as a friend when I feel that I can talk with the person freely. Defining best friend is difficult for me. Because I have never had best friend. But if I define it my definition is that a person who I can rely not only it but also the person relies me.
