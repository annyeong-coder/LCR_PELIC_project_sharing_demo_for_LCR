The third bumper sticker is Missing husband and dog. Attention 100 reward for dog. What the humor depends on is the fact that a dog has more valuable than a husband. What this means is a wife loves a dog more than her husband. The forth bumper sticker is Change is inevitable except for vending machines. What this is referring to is an abstract a change of a human being and a vending machine. What's funny about this is the fact that the writer makes fun with the word change which has two different meanings. The first meaning is the process or result of something or someone becoming different and another one is the money that you get back when you pay for something with more money than it costs. The fifth bumper sticker is I m in no hurry. I'm on my way to work. What this is about is a driver who is in a rush to go to work. In my opinion I think this bumper sticker is sarcastic.
