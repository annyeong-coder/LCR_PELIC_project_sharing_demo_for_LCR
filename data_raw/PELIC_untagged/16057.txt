When I finished high school I already knew that I wanted to study art. I chose two universities where I could study. One of them was very prestigious famous and high level university. It was going to be very hard to be admitted there. Another was good but not very prestigious. I supposed that I would probably study in the second university. To study in the first one looked like a dream to me. However just in case I applied to both universities. In order to be admitted I should take entrance exams and interviews. In the second university I received good grades just as I expected. In the first one my results were worse but I still had a chance to enter. I was waiting for my interview when I knew I was admitted to the second university. However I was disappointed because they needed my original documents that I gave to the first university. If I didn't do it I would lose my place there. If I did it I would lose any chance to enter the first university because taking back the documents meant giving up the purposes to study there. I really wanted to study in the better university but I was afraid of entering nowhere. I thought that the chance to enter the first university was too small. So I gave my documents to the university where I was admitted. Later on I knew that by my exams' results I had all chances to enter the better university. I regretted about my decision. I thought I should've had patience and waited. I should've believed in myself. Finally I might've been admitted to the better university and I could've graduated from there. However now I don't regret at all. I had to do what I did. I'm glad about my choice. Now I just regret that I regretted about something.
