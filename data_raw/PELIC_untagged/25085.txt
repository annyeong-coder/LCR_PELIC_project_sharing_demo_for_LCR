Hello everyone my name is Tsu ching Last Name . I came from Taiwan. I have been here for nine month. Before this I had been to the England for one year and the USA for half year. I came here to improve my English ability. I just had gratuaded from Taiwan's senior high school and I am a freshman now in National Central University of Taiwan. It ranked number 4 in Taiwan and my father is a professor of that university. So I am happy that I can go to that university. My favorite sport is running. But my father hates running. He always want me to take a walk with him after dinner. My mother and father planed to go to Alaska on July for vacation by ship. And I will go back to Taiwan that time.
