Dear Mr. President I read an article about how The U. S. Sells tobacco abroad. According to the article the U. S tobacco companies encourage young people worldwide to smoke by advertising their products. The article also mentioned that in some countries tobacco companies never would have gotten a start without the help of a powerful ally the U. S. Government. As a result young people are more likely to smoke and sales outside the U. S. Have more than tripled since 1985. It is good for tobacco companies because they profit are high but on the other hands it is not good for our future. In my opinion smoking is dangerous for our health not only for the smoker itself but also for the second hand smokers. In the article I read that the U. S government also decided in 1964 that cigarettes are a major cause of death and disease. Thus all of us already know that smoking is not good and it is our task to discourage people from smoking not encourage them to do so. I realized that parents have responsibility to prevent their children from smoking. And I also realized that there are many organizations and institutions that have been trying to protect young people from smoking. But our efforts per se are not enough. In fact we need the U. S. Government to help us protecting young people from smoking. The U. S government could help prevent young people to be a smoker by stop helping the tobacco companies open cigarette markets overseas. I realized that the U. S. Government's help would decrease tax revenue. But I believe that the U. S. Government has other ways to keep the revenue stable. The most important thing right now is that we should keep young people from bad habit. I believe that out future depends on them. Thus we should maintain young people if we want a better future life. Thank you for your attention. Sincerely Dewi Last Name
