I would like to write about my best friend. My friend Abdulrhman whose hair is long is a very helpful. He always helps his friends who live in Saudi Arabia. He was taking his friend who does not have a car to the college every day. His apartment which is located in green tree is close to my apartment. He always goes to Oakland where the Hillman library is located to read books.
