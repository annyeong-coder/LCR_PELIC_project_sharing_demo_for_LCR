I signed up the Skype when I was in Japan. My family in Japan also set up the Skype because I talked my family into setting it up. Now we can keep on talking each other without thinking over the telephone fare. When my mother rings up to say she wants to talk to me I hang up the phone once. After that we start up the software at once. I am glad to find out that I can talk to them very easily. Skype is the software that allows users to make telephone calls over the internet.
