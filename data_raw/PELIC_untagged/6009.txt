How to study for a test Many students become nervous before the test. The score of test affect in grade. Every one competes to get good score. However it is not difficult to study for exam if you have the right equipment. First of all it is important to concentrate on classes. Understanding in classes is the best way of studying. You can hear explanation of teacher and opinion of classmates. Teachers are expert of the major. Classmates are same position with you. To make it more effective you should study before classes. You need to have base knowledge. It is also important to study after school while memory is still fresh. If you study this way you really squire skills and don't have to study much before the test. Before the test you need to revise what you learned. It is easy to understand if you have a clear note. Compare with text review it. Then Solve problems from texts. You can know what you don't understand. By keeping solve problems you become more practicable. When you are studying by yourself sometimes you take long time to solve simple problems or misunderstand and never notice it. If you have something hard to understand you should ask someone. This helps to save time and be certain your understanding. In my case I always study with friends before the test. For this way we can share the difficult tasks. We can teach what we can't understand each other. I think students who can't get good grade don't have good preparation. When you study effective you don't have to be confused and take so much time. It is not difficult if you prepare in right way.
