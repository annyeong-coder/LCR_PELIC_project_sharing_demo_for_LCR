In fact about two million people are using this airport in a day. In addition at the airport you can find the architectural beauty and function are well harmonized. More specifically its basic design is based on the half circle so each building section of the airport looks like a bowl which is upside down. While the exterior design is using various sizes of curves the interior design is using many kinds of straight lines both horizontal and vertical. Lots of vertical steel columns combined with horizontal beams are supporting the rounded roof. They are all symmetrical and well balanced.
