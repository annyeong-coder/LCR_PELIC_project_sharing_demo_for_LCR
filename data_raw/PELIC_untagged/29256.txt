If you are traveling to Saudi Arabia I can offer you some advice. First You had better reserve room in hotel before you came. You had better have valid passport. You should have some cash money. If you want to rent a car you had better have international driver's license. You should have GPS navigator if you want to drive in Saudi Arabia. You ought to learn some arabic vocabulary before you came. You had better not talk with women. You ought ot know about culture Saudi Arabia. If someone invite you to his home to have dinner or lunch you should eat with your right hand. You should shake your hand if you want ot greet someone.
