I have a friend who is from Taiwan in the ELI. She is not my class mate but I met her through my friend who is my class mate. She has short and black hair. I sometimes go shopping with her. One day she and I went to a shopping mall which is in Water front and spent lots of money to buy clothes. Especially she spent lots of money to buy a watch and a bag which are very expensive although they were on sale. I convinced her to refund the bag. At last she refunded the bag. We have been spending most of time together. Also we planned to go to New York and Washington DC together in August after finishing this semester. I am so sure that we will have lots of fun there.
