I have been most influenced by Dr. Alb. He is one of my great professors in my home university. He thought me a lot of the beautiful excited things beside the knowledge of his course. I was helped by him during the class time and his valued time to correct my mistake and to give me some of his professional experience for example how to solve complex problem and how to relax you after a hard laboratory experiential. I was persuaded by him to follow my ambition. In fact all the time he was helped me form his own time sometime I was considered like gift whereas his name will be in this study as well. I was taught by him to achieve the King Abdul Allah award for best engineering study to solve the shortage of the sweat water in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Plainly my values were formed because of his name. I am still inspired by him especially be the way to communicate with the people. How to communicate with the obstacles will always are remembered by me for ever.
