In addition there are more and more programs which are designed on the smart cell phone that can help us to protect ourselves and prevent from the damage. They really have effects on our safety. However cell phones also bring us some damage and negative effects when we use them. Although they provide a convenient way to communicate on line we actually lose our attention to people nearby us. For example we always use our cell phone to pass the waiting time instead of chatting with our family at a reunion dinner. Nevertheless it is also a way that we can use to communicate. We might be more relax and active to share our life and thinking on line. In my opinion it is an attractive even better way to shorten the distance between people. Consequently no matter you are an adult or a child a worker or a student you cannot live without a cell phone. We even can't deny that cell phones actually bring us a more convenient life and be beneficial to society. It will still be an essential and significant role in our life in the future.
