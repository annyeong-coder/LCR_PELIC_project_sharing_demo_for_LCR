I like to introduce to you one of my classmate by explaining you the features of his first name then by giving you informations about his life generally. His first name is ANON_NAME_0 he is a Saudi Arabia man. In his country many names have a meaning his means Thanks . Therefore he likes his name for his meaning and also because it is his grandfather name. It is important to note that ANON_NAME_0 doesn't use a title for his name but he has a nickname it is Mido. Indeed in Saudi Arabia his first name is very used so in order to do the difference his friends always call him by his nickname. Besides he has a brother who is called Hamed too. It is just the spelling which is different. He has a sister whose the first name is Arwa. ANON_NAME_0 comes from Saudi Arabia and more exactly he lived in Damman.
