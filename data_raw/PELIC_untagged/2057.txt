My name is Jaeyeon ANON_NAME_0. I am 19 years old. I live in Monroeville. I am college student in Korea. My major is accounting. Why I come in US because my father works at Westinghouse. So I am studying English here in Pittsburgh. End of April last year I arrived in America. My hobbies are listening to music and chatting with my friends. I am missing my relatives and friends.
