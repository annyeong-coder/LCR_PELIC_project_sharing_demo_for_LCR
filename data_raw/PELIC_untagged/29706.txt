There was an election in my country two years age. Before they started the election there were a lot of advertisements for different candidates. Unfortunately while electing the government cheated in the election. After changing votes of people all the people were so sad and furious. As they were angry they started many protests against the government. Protesting against the government police started shooting people. Because police started shooting people many people died and injured in those days and others become more furious than before. Killing many people triggered other protests against the government. So the government just tries to control people by killing them but people persisting in changing government. As a result there are many protests against the government in specific days and millions of people are trying to change the regime.
