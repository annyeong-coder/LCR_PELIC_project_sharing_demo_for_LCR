I had never lived alone before came to the USA. I had been lived at my family in my country. I had never cooked everyday before came to the USA. My mom had cooked everyday in Turkey. Only I had helped to her. I had never cooked pizza before came to USA. One day my father's friend and I had gone to his friends store. He had learned to me how cook pizza. We had cut domatoes mushrooms green peppers. We had put in to pizza. And had cooked pizza.
