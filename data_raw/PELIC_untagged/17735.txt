The causes of unemployment The economic parameters are common in almost the entire world because the economical system is the same. Basically many countries are related through on international trade such as importation or exportation of Source Materials. Then when a country has an economical problem affect directly on the decrease of job's offer and less consumption and a lot of other things also we can attach the increase in the number of graduates from universities. Those are some causes that affect unemployment. The first cause is the decrease of job's offer. Under economics' problems companies' owners don't get adequate earnings for this reason they offer low incomes and a lot of people are dismissed of their jobs. The second cause is less consumption. That is a vicious cycle because less consumption brings unemployment and when there is unemployment people don't buy anything since they don't have money. Then the only way to tear down that cycle is giving subsides maybe from the government to companies thus companies must give employment to people. On the other hand the increase in the number of graduates from universities affects the job market and reduces the opportunities to find job. For example in Chile there are a lot of lawyers and business managers and they don't have so much work's opportunities or they have low incomes. In conclusion unemployment's causes are a lot but economical system has some unsolved problems and that produce vicious cycles. Thus the government of each country should help economical system also government should have information about how many people are studying the same major at the university. Finally if the previous causes are being solved job offer won't be decreased. Could it be possible
