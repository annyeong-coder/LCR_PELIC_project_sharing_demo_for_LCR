From my perspective I do not like the concept of being in a village that likes a prison for the rest of my life. Like the author said that he is feeling claustrophobic and uneasy about himself living in a gated retirement community for the coming month Lines 17 20 . Moreover I think I will not going to live in a village like that when I become senior citizen because I want to surrounded by my relatives and my children . I also want to be with my friend and my old neighbors and catch up on their gossip. For example From ANON_NAME_0's perspective it is a very nice place to live in Lines 33 36 . Then he went and sat with ANON_NAME_0 and started catching up on their neighbors' gossip. This excerpt demonstrates that he and ANON_NAME_0 wants also to listen to the gossip of their old neighbors. Another reason I want to see my children grow get married and be surrounded by their children because I think life without children will be no fun.
