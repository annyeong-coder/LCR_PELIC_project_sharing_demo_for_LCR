I have come to pittsburgh 25 days ago and still I am trying to get used to it. Recently I AM STUDYING IN THE ELI IN PITTSBURGH UNIVERSITY. I DONT LIKE TO DRIVE IN THIS CITY DESPITE LESS TRAFIC SOME OF THE RULES ARE DIFFERENT FROM ISTANBUL so I do mistakes sometimes. I AM NOT DOING ANY SPORTS RIGHT NIOW but I think I am going to do again as soon as I get used to here. Also night life is good in Pittsburgh and many museums exist to go round. In my opinion pittsburgh is a reasonable city for studying.
