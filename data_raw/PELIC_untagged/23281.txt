Topic 1 Books movies. Many times movie directors take a book and make a movie out of it. Most of the time is the movie the one that is criticized by the media. Magazines use to say things as the book is great but the movie is terrible . The first example that comes to my mind is the opposite. Many years ago I saw the Brazilian movie Ciudad de Dios City of God . The movie is based in the book of the same name written by Paulo Lins. I read the book after watch the movie and without doubt I can say that the book was terrible and the movie was great. Both of them describe the life of poor kids in a favela poor and marginalized neighborhood in Brazil of Rio de Janeiro called Ciudad de Dios . Both of them have the same plot describe the same characters and show the same problems. Nevertheless the book is boring slow with a lot of words and details that a good publisher would have taken away at the first glance. On the other hand the scenes at the movie are faster more organized and clearer. The movie shows written screens that break the monotony of the book. Now Paulo Lins is famous around the world and I wonder why. Maybe the lesson is that you can write a terrible book and find a good director who would like to make a movie out of it. Just find him and your life can be solved.
