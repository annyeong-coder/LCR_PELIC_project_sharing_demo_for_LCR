Last month my husband and I saw avatar movie. We were excited. The first thirty minutes the movie was confusing. Also my husband was annoyed because some people were talking during the movie. In the middle of the movie we were surprised. Also it was exciting story. In short the avatar movie was not disappointing at all.
