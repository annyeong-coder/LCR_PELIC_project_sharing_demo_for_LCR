Hi Aziz today I realized that I can draw very well and who figure out that is a painter. You know me I haven't been drawing since 2007. After we finished the high school I was interesting in play soccer swimming. But from today I have a beautiful picture it was a good feeling when I did it. I want to try the sky diving I haven't tried before but I have been taking picture with some of my friends in the plane it was fun that day. Think about it we should go there.
