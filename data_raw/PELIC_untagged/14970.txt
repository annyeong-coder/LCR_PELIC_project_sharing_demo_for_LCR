Date Feb 02 2009 Student Teresa Topic Twins have the same traits According to a Dr. Bouchard's research there are lots of the same things in twins such as their appearance they walk the way their voice their behavior etc. For example I have twins cousin when I was little I can't tell who is the older one who is the younger one they looked the same to me. But after getting along with them I started to tell their different ways. But you won't recognize them until you know them very well cause both the older one and the younger one have big heads and look similarly. We believe twins have lots of the same traits compare to normal relationship between older brother and younger one.
