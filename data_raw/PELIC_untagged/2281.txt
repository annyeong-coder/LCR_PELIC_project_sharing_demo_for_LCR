It is important to have a positive role model for a young people development. It is such an important thing to have a role model in the family. This person can be a father mother or relative. That is someone close to family any time you can be with him or you can ask him anything you want and you can learn his experience you can copy his act. These people could be a teacher or advisor but my opinion is to be someone from the family. You can trust him you can share something special with him. I had a lot of role models in my life. Important one is my dad because I found him close to me. I wanted to be just like him. But as I said I had a lot of role models. For example if I wanted to play football I was looking around my role model. First I just wanted to play like him after I can add something from me to improve myself faster. I was trying to act or talk like him but not exactly similar. I usually put something from me too. I combine my act and his act together. Some people find their role model in their book while they are reading or they admire from somebody but I guess I am doing the easiest way just find a role model skip the learning actions from the books etc. I know that somebody doesn't push me to read something or to do something I don't do it. But my opinion is that is the fastest and the right way to learn something during the child development to have a role model in your family.
