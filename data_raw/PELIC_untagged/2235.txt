There was very interesting to meet my boy friend. We met each other in my company. However we didn't fall in love when I stayed at my company. When I quitted my job we were still connecting with each other. One day he asked me to go out with him. It was a pretty memory. We went to the Mountain ANON_NAME_0 Ming at night. While we were walking on the grass we saw a lot of couples were sitting on the grass. While we were looking for some places to sit a man was saying loudly Look! A shooting start. My boy friend said Make a wish quickly! . When I made a wish he kissed my cheek. I was surprised when he did it. We didn't say anything for a long time. When he broke the silence he apologized to me. We talked about our relationship after he apologized. When we talked with each other we knew that we've already liked each other for a long time. Hence we became boy and girl friends after that day.
