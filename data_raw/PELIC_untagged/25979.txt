In my opinion boys and girls should be definitely educated together. Kids and youngs without sex discrimination should grow up together to get ready to the real life. Because they will be working all together when they start to their career. School teaches to students a lot. Not only by the classes they take but the comminication between friends and teachers improve their relationship skills. They learn from eachother different things girls have different thoughts boys have different. So when they stay alltogether their ideas take form globally. The adaptation to the real life starts from childhood. That's why I have a bias against seperate schooling.
