My friend graduated for half year and he couldn't fine the jobs. He tried to ask my opinions. My friend Hi Sheng ANON_NAME_0 I couldn't find the jobs for long time and I feel worried about that. I tried to check jobs on the internet. Can you give me some advice I Yes of course I think you should prepare your personal information before you look for your jobs. In addition you had better prepare your skill licenses. When you have prepared these files you may register the website for jobs hunt. When I graduated from graduate school I tried to provide my personal information to several companies and I tried to promote for myself. You should figure out what kind jobs do you like to do or prefer to do. It is an important idea. You had better to spend several hours or days to think about jobs that you would like to do. I used to spend several days at library and checked on the internet to figure out many kinds job. I think salary is a significant fact even me but you may not to choose a job only according to the salary. You should think about your major and your background for example I chose to be a mechanical engineer and my major is mechanic. As a result mechanical engineer is appropriate for me. Don't feel worried. If you refer to my suggestions I think you can fine the good job.
