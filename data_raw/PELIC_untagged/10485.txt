Travel weather storm sea beach friends Island rain sunshine ship bus plan beach friends. Do not be disappoint and do something pray . When I was college student I took a travel with my friends. We went to the Saryang Island. We had many plan like bus and ship time schedule and each charge fee and play schedule and food. Weather was sunshine in first day. But next day we had a big problem. We met a typhoon in second day. So we ready to get out of island. But we couldn't find a ship. We were being nervous. After a while I was making a smile in my face. Because we could see the sun. That was just a shower. So we kept going travel. I had good experience.
