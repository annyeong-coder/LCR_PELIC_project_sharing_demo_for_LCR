Using motivation is my primary attitude when I give feedback to others. When people get a plause from others they will have a confidence in their mind. And then they can reach a good goal or high standard in their life. When they get their acheivement they will get another plause from others. And they go another cycle again. This is the reason why I prefer to choice a motivated attitude to feedback others. People can get better from my plause. However If this person is a lazy person I may use demotivated attitude to feedback him or her. I want to stimulate their motivation. Regardless I firstly try to give a motivated feedback to other people for triggering their minds.
