One day my friend and I were drinking for my friend when he texted my friend to ask an address of bar. At that time the time was 10pm. SHE TOLD ME THET HER CELL PHONE DIDN'T HAVE 0 She text him instead of 0. I WAS NOT SURE IF HE COULD UNDERSTAND THE ADDRESS OR NOT. However I DIDN'T HAVE IDEA WHAT I SHOULD MENTION TO HER. As a consequence he got lost and arrived 2hours late. HE WAS MAD ABOUT MY FRIEND THAT SHE TEXTED HIM A WRONG ADRRESS. She explained that her cell phone doesn't have 0 . THE FUNNY THINS IS THAT WE COMPLETELY GOT DRUNK AND DIDN'T REALIZE TO USE O INSTEAD.
