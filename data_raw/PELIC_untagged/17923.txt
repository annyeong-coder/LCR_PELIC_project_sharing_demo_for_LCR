I have four very close friends who help me when they need me. We have been friends for since elementary school which means we have been together almost 25 years. Wow. Since I moved to America the chance to keep in touch with all of them have gotten less. But one of them moved to Washington DC with her family. Her name is Nyamka and she just had a beautiful twin girls. Nyamka who always enjoys being outdoor is facing a little bit trouble because she has to stay home all day to take care the babies. Her husband who is very handsome and hard working man encourages her all the time. Last year she established the elementary school for Mongolian children who live in Washington DC area. The school which expanded quickly has already more than 100 students. All students who learn Mongolian language culture and history are under 10 years old. By the way my friend Nyamka who is coming next week to visit to me is a very creative and intelligent person. I always proud of her.
