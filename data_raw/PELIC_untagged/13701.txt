Javier is my classmate. He is from Colombia. We are students in ELI school in Pittsburgh. He will stay in this country until he finishes studying English. He is going to his country after he finishes this term. While he is in Pittsburgh he will visit many places. As soon as he leaves the class he will look for his friend who will go with him to the movie. Before he goes to the movie he will go home.
