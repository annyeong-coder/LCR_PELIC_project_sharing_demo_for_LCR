This story is about a boy whose name was Jim. Usually bad boys in Sunday school books are called James. This boy did not have a kind sick mother like bad boys in the Sunday books. Jim's mother was strong and cruel. Once he stole the key of the kitchen and ate the jim and denied that. Usually bad boys' mothers forgive them when they do that but that was conversely with Jim his mother hit him. One day he climbed up an apple tree to steal apples but the thing that happens for the bad boys in Sunday books did not happen for him he did not break his arm or get torn. Jim hated moral boys once he stole the teacher's penknife and when he was afraid about that someone can find it out he put it into the cap of the good and moral boy. Jim is wonderful nothing can hurt him. For example once he stole his father's gun and went hunting and did not hurt him self. Then he grew up and had a large family and became rich and respected. Although this Jim had many troubles in the early stage of his life but he became successful.
