When I was living in Japan I met my friend Julien who comes from the Canada didn't speak Japanese. We met a bar at my city. While I was talking with my friend he asked us about an interesting place. For example night clubs bars and restaurants. He was not used to here. Although I couldn't speak English well we made a friend. Because we had a same hobby which was music. It was seven years ago he was working at medical company as a English teacher. Unfortuatly last year he lost employment so he had to go back his counrty. Since I met him I was interested in English because I thought that speking another language is fantastic to communicate with foreighn people. Why I chose Pittsburgh to study English Now that he is living in Toronto. It is not far from here. This summer I will go to there to see him.
