My soul mate is Melissa who has been my friend from I was 5 years old. She is taking fashion classes which are very interesting. Last week she introduced me some of her friends who are very nice. These friends whose major is fashion design too are from France and Italy. It was a beautiful experience because I learned some words in new languages which are french and italian. Finally I told them that my major is very interesting also.
