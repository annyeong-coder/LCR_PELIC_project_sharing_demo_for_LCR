By 1997 I HAD BEEN in my elementary school. I HAD BEEN SWIMMING with my friends. At that time I hated to go to the swimming pool but now I think swimming is such a good exercise. I HAD BEEN PLAYING the piano. I started to learn it when I was 8 years old. Actually I HADN'T STUDIED hard. I HAD PLAYED a lot with my friends. When I HAD BEEN PLAYING in front of my house my mother used to call me It's time to eat dinner. I used to go to a church every Saturday. I can remember that we had a great Christmas party in the church so I and my friend were so excited.
