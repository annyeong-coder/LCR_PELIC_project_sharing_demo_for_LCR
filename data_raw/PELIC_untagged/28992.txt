I would want to take some tools with me to a desert island. First I have to take matches because I can start fire and cook. Second I think I should take a knife. With a knife I can cut food and protect myself. Third I ought to take a flashlight. When the sky becomes dark I can use a flashlight to check condition. Finally I had better take batteries because flashlight needs to use them.
