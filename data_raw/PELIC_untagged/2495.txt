First should look at the price and think about Do I have enough money to buy it When I buy it do I have enough money to use this kind of questions. Second must to know the safety problem and how to use the equipment. Many people have a car but there have some people don't think about the questions so make their life harder. For example I have a friend he very wanted to buy a car but he didn't have enough money so he borrowed some money from the bank or other friends. Now he has to work so hard to pay back the money. Safety problem is important too. You have to think about If I get an accident the front and the back will be safe For example some car's safe air bag it's too hard so some people hit the bag and died. You should ask sales man the safe air bag problem. You also have to know how to use the equipment in the car. When you buy a car you most know these two problems. It will make your life easier and safety.
