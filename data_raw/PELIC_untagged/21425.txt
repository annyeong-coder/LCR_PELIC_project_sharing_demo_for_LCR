To stay on a desert island for a long time I have to take matches. This is mainly for the basic existence. Light a fire with matches and will provide us with lighting heating and can prepare food. The second object I should take knife which I may kill animals for food. The knife can be used for more things like peeling pineapple or other fruits or cutting firewood. Last thing the third it must be chocolate which can change many things like mood hungry. I think with that three things I can leave on a desert island even more than five weeks.
