Personal Success One of the things that I have been successful at is driving a car. Five years ago I wanted to learn how to drive a car because I was curious. In fact the most important reason was I saw a young girl driving a sport car one day. I felt very jealous in my mind so it encouraged me to decide that I must be successful in driving. First I went to a school that taught people how to drive. Every day I took classes about traffic knowledge and safety codes and my coach taught me how to drive on the road. In the beginning it was full of excitement and danger. It really was an adventure to me because I had to see hear and be careful at the same time when I was driving. But finally I passed the test and I got a driver's licence. I was joyful that I achieved it. Second I had to practice how to drive on the real road. My friends accompanied me. They gave me much courage to do it. Finally I am a good driver now.
