When I had come to the U. S I felt homesick because I had never lived far away my country a long time like that. Then I signed up a contract with wireless cellphone company to keep contact with my mother and some my old friends. In first months I was really worry about my contract because I talked over time a lot . I was unexpected after I saw my bill it cost so expensive. Sometimes I wanted to give up because I had to pay a lot of money while I had to pay another fees. After that I had a plan with my cell phone I usually called on weekend and after 9 00 pm. On day time and weekday I avoided prolong talking into which was more 20 minutes and I hung up calling which wasn't much important. I was successful with this plan I still keep on my contract while keep in touch with my mother and my friends.
