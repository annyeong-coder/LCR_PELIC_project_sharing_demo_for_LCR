After graduated from junior high school I thought I would be changed. I thought I would study hard so I decided not to read comics and not to watch TV. And I thought I would have a good relationship with my teachers and be nice to all my classmates. But those didn't work that way. I didn't study hard. Sometimes I skipped classes to go to see a movie and I often read comics during the classes. I watched TV everyday until late at night. And I rarely listened to my teacher. I didn't followed what my teacher told me to do and I told some of my classmates that I didn't like them.
