One of the most mysterious legends I have heard from Russian folklore is a legend about a fern's flower. The ferns are known to never blossom. However it was said that on the night of July 7 the most beautiful tern flower had bloomed. It was blossomed for just a few hours. This mystery occurred once in a year and could have been turned into luck for those by whom it would have been found. This flower was alleged to have had miraculous properties. It was believed that the place where this fern was growing was surrounded by an impenetrable forest and that it was not easy to find it. This legend was made up of several traditional folk beliefs especially the beliefs that are connected with the night of July 7. It was considered the most mysterious night of the year. The night was filled with different customs and superstitions. In this night all evil spirits were thought to have appeared and to have made a big mess. All herbs got medicinal properties. Several dig fires were lighted around the villages. People were jumping over the fires. It was supposed to help them to cultivate heavy harvest. Nowadays July 7 has lost its mysterious features it's just a summer holiday. However the legend about the magical fern's flower has not been forgotten. Several stories tales songs about it have been written so far.
