Recently in Japan there are so many young people who do not have will to work. People call them NEET Non Employment Education and Training and the number of NEET people are increasing for decades. This problem affects on our economy seriously. There are three ways to cheer NEET people up to have will to work to give them opportunities for training to start working to admit flexible work style and to help them to be independent. First NEET people need some opportunities for training to work. Most of them lost a chance and timing to join the society. There is no creation when we complain about their laziness so our society need help them to have opportunities such as work shop talk time and training for job interviews. Second they should start working from just a few hours. As I mentioned above they need opportunities to join the society. It is complex to start working regularly from the beginning so we need to admit there are a lot of work styles. Third their parents need to help them to be independent. It is easy and no regulation to live at parent's home. However we need to have power and knowledge to live by ourselves. Then parents should encourage them to make money by themselves and should teach them how wonderful to work for other people and themselves. In conclusion NEET people need to be given opportunities for training to work or study to admit flexible work styles and parent's help to be independent
