ANON_NAME_0 3 22 The reason of Intelligence is Different Intelligence is primarily a result of the environment in which a child is raised. Even if the child has inherently excellent intelligence it couldn't be said that they will be a successful and intelligent person. The child who makes an effort can be the intelligent person the success can reveal by pursuit of the child about life. First effort is important to show intelligence of a child. Even if the child has good genetics intelligence can't be revealed without the effort. For example children get test of measuring IQ. But usually children who have high IQ are not the children who get a good grade in exams of school. The children who do their best in exams get a good grade. Therefore the good genetics can't be the reason of good intelligence. Second pursuit of child makes child have good intelligence. People have diverse objects while they are living. The object is different since when people are children and the life become to be diverse by the pursuit of the children. Even if children have good genetics if they have pursuit which can't show their intelligence such as just fun they can't be shown to have good intelligence. Thus the good genetics can't be said that it is the reason of good intelligence. World is diverse people is also diverse. Inherent genetic is not the problem to be intelligent person. By an effort and pursuit about which life they live intelligence can be changed.
