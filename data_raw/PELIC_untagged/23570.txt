When I was fifteen my best friend who had received two invitations for the best party of the year gave me one of them. If she hadn't given it to me I wouldn't had even consider crashing the party. But she insisted so I spoke with my brother how is a computer genius and he told me that if Eugenia my friend lend me him her ID for one day he could make me a fake ID for me. Had Eugenia not given me the ID I would had abort the plan but she happily gave it without arguing. Then I phoned ANON_NAME_0 one of my best friends to ask him if he could take me to the party. Had he said No and I would have also aborted the plan. But again he said yes. So I began my preparations I wasn't that confident because if I had been invited to the party I would have bought a new dress. Anyway I got ready and it turn out that even if I had a new dress I wouldn't have look as amazing as I did. I got to the party and my heart was racing. In the entrance the guards separated men and women had I been with ANON_NAME_0 and I would have asked him to take me back. They scan the code bar in my invitation and then they compared the ID with the invitation name. The man told me he had to call the supervisor. I felt my heart was going to pop out but when the supervisor arrived she just apologize for the troubles and let me in. It was the best party ever. Had it not been for my friend's and my brother and I would have missed it.
