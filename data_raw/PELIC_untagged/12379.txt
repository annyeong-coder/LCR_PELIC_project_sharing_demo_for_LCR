Tom Higgins got his chance to open his restaurant but unfortunately his restaurant did not success. There are three reasons that made the restaurant fail. Tom Higgins made two financial mistakes that lead to this failure. The first mistake he offer expensive food for student and usually students prefer cheaper food rather than the expensive one. The second mistake he accepts just the credit card for the payment. Some student do not have credit card and other do not prefer to use them in the restaurants. He did not have a good advertising strategy which is the best way for any restaurant to success. The best way to advertise something is by putting good and nice commercial board. If you look on the commercial board out side his restaurant you can see that this board is too small and nobody can see it. And he wrote a lot of no on this board. This will create unpleasant felling in the students. Other way to advertise is to choose good place for your restaurant. And Mr. Higgins restaurant is the last restaurant in the street. He did not consider his consumers' needs. He used students for cooking not professional cookers. This affected the quality of food that he offers for his customers. And he did not have a take out and delivery serves for his customers. Which have negative effect on his restaurant. To have successful restaurant you should ask some experts to help you by there financial advertising and customers needs ideas. And Tom Higgins did not pay attention for these three important factors. That is way his restaurant fails.
