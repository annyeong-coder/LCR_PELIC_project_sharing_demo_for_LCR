A Comparison of the Street Houses in America and Taiwan House is the main shelter that we need in our daily life for living for working or for leisures. Houses are considered to build because of its function its material and its appearance. There are some similarities and differences between the street houses in America and Taiwan that I have lived. To compare the street houses in America and Taiwan first at all it seems to be a lot of in common. The function are built by the user's behavior and habits and followed the order of the spaces. Also the materials of the houses are generally constructed of the industrial products such as steels concretes woods plastics etc. In addition both of the appearance of the houses are designed by the user's hobbies or tone but still followed the rules of the government urban plan. It was when I was living in America and found the differences between the two house styles that I really realized. Although both houses are built by the user's behavior and habits American house has generally two front doors because of the climb. The public rooms inside the house in America like the living room the dining room and the kitchen are next to next or connects with doors because of the different culture from Taiwanese.
