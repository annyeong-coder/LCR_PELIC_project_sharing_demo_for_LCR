Smallville is a fascinating movie. I was interested by season 4 episode 16. The episode 16 was exciting and captivating when Lex Luthor was affected by a lazer generated by a scientific machine. I was surprised just fewer minutes later to see Lex doubled into two persons. Then Lex became a surprising man and Clarck his best friend was confused about his best friend's behavior. Soon Lex tried to kill Clarck and he was astonished to learn that his best friend had the super power. Lex became an annoying and dangerous man for all his friends. Finally it was not the real and interesting Lex but his frightening double with his evil thoughts that made everybody scared.
