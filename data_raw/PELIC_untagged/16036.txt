In many countries there are different laws for when people can get their driver's license. In some countries people can get their driver's license under age 18. In my opinion young people under age 18 shouldn't get a driver's license. First teenagers are too young and are less responsible. They drive cars for fun and think to having a car is cool. For example when many teenagers are together and they want to make a trip with the car they drive fast because they talk together and don't pay enough attention to the traffic. In addition teenagers cannot assess any dangerous or difficult situations. If a teenager gets into a dangerous situation maybe he she doesn't recognize that or maybe he she doesn't know what to do. For instance if black ice occurs spontaneously the driving conditions are changed. This situation is certainly difficult and dangerous for all drivers but how can someone deal with that without any experience and awareness I think teenagers shouldn't get their driver's license before age 18 because their sense of responsibility is not developed. Also they don't make difficult decisions at this age.
