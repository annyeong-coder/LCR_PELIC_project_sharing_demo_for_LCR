It is a special memories for me when I was 10 years old my mother took me to Japan for vacation. We went to Tokyo Disnyland hot spring Fuji mountain and so many great places the people in there also friendly. My favorite food in Japan is Ramen it's a kind of noodle soup and that's very delicious! This is my first time to went abroad so it's made me really excited! After that I went to there twice.
