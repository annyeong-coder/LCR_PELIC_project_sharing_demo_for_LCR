The vacation spot is wonderful and excellent! There is Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. There are about 22 kinds of historical relics and animal specimens which are exhibited on three separate levels. I find each level also has some interesting guidance activities and educational learning so you could learn lots of information about them that you never knew before. For example there is an Inside Ancient Egypt area which unlock the secrets of 23 Egyptian mummies on the ground level and I can see what life was like in an Egyptian marketplace in 2450 BC. I feel Ancient Egyptian was very intelligent and competent. Also there is a World of Mammals area on the main level where you can find out many kinds of animals of specimens like birds mammals and insects. I feel they look like real animals especially the lions of Tsavo. In addition to the many exhibits I especially like the Evolving Planet area on upper level where you can know that the lives on earth were how to evolve form the dawn of life to dinosaurs and our extended human family. I think it's also very interesting and exciting for everyone. Finally there are also many strange and special exhibits and activities. I believe if you pay more attention to explore you will discover more fun there. It's why I fell the Field Museum of Natural History is wonderful and excellent.
