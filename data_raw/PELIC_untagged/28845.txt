Topic 2 Viewpoint A Most students look forward to their summer break when the semester starts. They couldn't wait for four months later. In contrast for their parents when the summer break comes that would be the begin of their nightmare. Also in order to studying in the university high school students must keep studying during their vacation. We all agree that teenagers are full of energy to do every kind activity. Most of times they seek for adventure game and try to drink alcohol. Those will be happened during their break because that could be the best opportunity when their parents both go to work and nobody restrict their bad behavior. It is important that we must review what we have learned after classes or we forget them easily. After a summer break which is more than couple months it is hard to imagine high school students still remember how much knowledge that teachers taught in last semester. However after graduating from the high school most of them will apply into a college. If they don't remember what they have learned or couldn't apply those information in their major they would have a worse college life because they must not have available time to get along with their friends and all they have to do is study.
