ANON_NAME_0 Baracaldo A Funny Story During my college time I attended a lot of classes that where pretty much similar in the sense that nothing strange or unusual ever happened. Nevertheless one day in my algorithms class something quite funny made the entire class start talking and laughing without control. We were all sitting and paying attention when the teacher announced that we had a special guest that day. The guest arrived presented himself and started talking about the class subject. Soon everybody was murmuring which is consider to be very rude in my country but no one could help it. The whispering was followed by a soft laugh. I guess all the students knew what was going on when near the end of the class a student raised his hand and the guest very politely said he was glad to answer his question. So the student said the most unexpected thing Well I was wondering if you could close your pant's zipper I can't see your underwear! It was the most hilarious situation ever! The man blushed in just a few seconds and everybody in the classroom was laughing without any restraints. It was something very unlucky for the teacher but what could we do no every day someone walks in to give a class with an open zipper!
