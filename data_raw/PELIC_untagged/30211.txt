Everyone around the world should has some interests in the specific types of entertainment. Since there are a wide range of them the entertainment that the most I like limited to three areas discovering the world establishing communication and playing sport. The biggest thing that I love is discovering the world . I do that through two Activities . The first one is reading in the books to increase my knowledge about the events that occur around me . For example I love reading in geographic books to increase my information about the earth . The second one that I discover is browsing the internet. I love the Internet because it gives me a lot of information in short time. I like newspaper websites to update my information about the world. Establishing communication is a wonderful thing that I love to do it . Always I call my friends and my family. I prefer being in touch with them . Also I feel free when I call my friends and family . I do that to create a good relationship . The smallest thing that I do is playing sport . Although sport is very important for our body I do it seldom . The most sport I do it is playing soccer . I love playing soccer but now I cannot because I have a provisional condition that I had a surgery last month. I will do it when I became well. In conclusion all of these three entertainment areas was and still give me every thing that I hope to do . Honestly I prefer doing the first one always because it is easier one for me .
