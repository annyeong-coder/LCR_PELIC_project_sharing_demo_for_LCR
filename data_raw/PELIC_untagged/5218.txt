I have always wanted to get a high enough TOEFL score for a Master's degree even before I came to the US. But I haven't achieved it. If I had gotten a sufficient TOEFL score before coming to the US I would have come to the US for Master's degree. For this reason I have come to the US to attend an English course. I had taken five months of English in Turkey before I came to the US. While I was taking English course I learned that learning English is easier in a place where it is the native language. When I decided to come to the US I had taken my teacher's advice and so I am in the US now.
