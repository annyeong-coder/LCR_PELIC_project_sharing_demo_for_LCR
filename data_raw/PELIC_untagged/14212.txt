I have a friend from childhood whose name is Jun. Jun who is a student in Korea wants to be an actor. He majored in electrical engineering which is my current major in a university. However he changed his major for his dream that is being a popular actor. We used to live in Busan which is located in the south of South Korea but now he lives in Seoul which is the capital city in Korea and I live in Pittsburgh for studying English. These days he has practiced acting in an entertainment company that is a little popular company in Korea. I hope he will be the most famous actor in the world. This is because if he gains fame and popularity I think it will bring good effects to me.
