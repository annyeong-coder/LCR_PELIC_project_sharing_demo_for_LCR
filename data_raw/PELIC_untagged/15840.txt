My family is so important to me. I love my all family. However I think the most important person for me is my mom. My mom is a beautiful woman. She is short and thin and her hair is brown medium and wavy. She has beautiful brown eyes. She usually wears jeans and a shirt. When we have a special event she likes to wear a dress. She can't go anywhere if she doesn't wear make up. My mom is very friendly. She is my best friend. First she took care of me when I was a child. Second she always helps me with my problems. It doesn't matter what kind. Third she is always nice to my friends. Finally she is a happy person and strong woman. I love my mom. She really is the best person in my life.
