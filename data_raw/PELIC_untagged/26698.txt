I always sit at the coner of classroom. I'm a man and I have black hair. I'm from korea. There are 2 Korean guys in the class but I'm not taller than another man. I like playing the guitar so I write about playing the guitar when I should write essay in grammar class as well as other classes. I live in my cousin's house. My cousin always encourages me to how to learn and speak English very well. I'm advised by other students who are studying abroad to be good at using English. While I'm taking off my clothes I usually call up with my parents after coming back to my house. I would prefer to finish doing my homework for a day. It bothers me when I do not finish doing my homework for a day. I do not like to delay what I have to do on that day.
