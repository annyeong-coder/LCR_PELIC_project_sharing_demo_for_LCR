In some countries teenagers have jobs while they are still students. I think this is a good idea for them if the jobs are useful for their life. Sometimes it is necessary for students thinking of their future career while they are still in high schools. Meanwhile the advisors also offer some opportunities of a job to let them experience what it is outside of the classes. However having a job while studying takes risks for students. It depends on what kinds of jobs they have and how much time they spend on a job. It reveals some infection for teenage students in several ways. We can focus on what the balance is useful for them. For the strong reason to agree that is teenagers having a job while studying has benefits for their school life. They can get a part time job after school and start to learn how to manage the daily time in schedules. For example when I was in senior high school I got a intership in students union. My school life got busy at that term but my boss there taught me how to reschedule my routin weekly. I'd got special experience there which I can't learn in class. That was really useful for me. In short teenagers should choose the balance for their school life. It's really important for them.
