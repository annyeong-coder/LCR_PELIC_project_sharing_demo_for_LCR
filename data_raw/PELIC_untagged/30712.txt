I grew up in Makkah where my grandmother and grandfather live. The neighborhood was very safe so I enjoy playing in the street with my cousin who is older than me. The backyard which is close to my grand's house was the place we spend most of the time in. Mr. ANON_NAME_0 who is the kindest man in the neighbor gave us candy every single time he sew us. On day in the morning when most of the neighbors were eating their breakfast outdoor we tried to taste what they have. We actually enjoyed living there showing good neighbors and peaceful place.
