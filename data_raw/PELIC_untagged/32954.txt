While I was watching a TV a dog barked at a stranger. When I was doing my homework I saw a thunderbolt. When I was having a dinner it started raining. I was writing a letter when my friend called. While I was running my friend was sleeping. I was washing dishes when my daughter played with a dog. I was driving a car when I heard a news. While I was taking a shower a dog was sitting near a shower room.
