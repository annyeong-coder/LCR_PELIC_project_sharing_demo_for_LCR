P. 235 5 Home is not where you live but where they understand you. German poet 1871 1914 . I think home is not necessarily a place where you live in but a place where people understand your feelings and needs. However I agree that someone will be longing to the place where he grew up but he will find someone who understands him in another place. Moreover I think you can find someone out there who shares your same perspective and who can help you when in need. I consider myself at home when I feel that people whom I interact with share the same ideas. It is obvious that you will enjoy the moment when you like the people to whom you talk. In conclusion the way you treat people who you sit with will lead to the same way people will treat you and that is how you gain mutual understanding.
