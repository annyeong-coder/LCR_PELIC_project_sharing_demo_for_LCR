At first I'm going to tell her that her haircut looks so pretty and then I'll tell her But if you get the ANON_NAME_0 Alba's haircut it'll be far better! I know the meaning of 'SUBTLE' in this question but I don't think this meaning is same with the meaning on my vocabulary homework exactly. By the way isn't 'haircut' the word for men I heard that the same meaning of the word for women is 'hairdo' but I'm not sure. Please teach me whether I can use 'haircut' for women.
