I think Martin is true. Because she do solve a lot of crimes with police. For example she find the missing people by map. At first she looks the victims' picture. Then she feels something. After that she feel where the victim is going on a map. Nickell might say that she get some imformation from police and make a good guess. The imformation she has is same as the imformation that police have. But I think police is more pofessional than her. Also her not only solve one case. So one case is lucky two cases is also lucky but how about more than three If it is only a good guess I think police can make a guess better than her. So I beleive it is a kind of psychic.
