Classification Architecture work distinctive and sometimes it is source of income. In the past architecture symbolizes of strength and durability but now it symbolizes of beauty and modernity more than in the past. As well as they were using stone before while now there are several other types. Whoever Architecture depends on an imagination flexibility and innovation. First of all before you design you have to imagine a shape of the building from outside. For example you imagine three dimension and elevation. In addition formation of the interior spaces such as when I studied in college architecture in the second year I design all spaces but in my mind before of papers. Also I found another alternative for the design. Secondly when you design any house for any customer there must flexibility in a design and time. Instance I change a design as desired an owner. Moreover I make time schedule for design so that I don't be late. The last one if you want to become famous you must invent an new idea when you design. For example a problem in a high rise is not a design. But the problem is how you find external form beautiful. To sum up I believe the saying Architecture is one of the eyes world . It depends on wider thinking easily changing and creating new ideas.
