After I came Pittsburgh I have faced a dilemma about relationships with my friends. Some teachers recommend me to go out with friend because they think that it becomes to acquire English skills. But should I follow this advice I think that without studying by my self after my classes I might be not able to improve my English skills. I'm always bothered whether I ought to hung out with friend or not. When I went to drink alcohol with my friends on Wednesday I drank too much. I had better have drunk more less and also I shouldn't have gone on Wednesday. From this experience I have to find a good balance between going out and studying.
