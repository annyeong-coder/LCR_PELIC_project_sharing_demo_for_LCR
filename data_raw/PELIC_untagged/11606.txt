If I am going to start a new business I will integrate common ways and unconventional ways. First of all I need to have enough finance that is the basis of a company. I can't start a new business without finance because it takes a lot of risks and that might lead to failure. This kind of way is different from Roddick's method. Next I will also utilize unconventional ways. Unconventional ways always make people surprise and often get the unexpected outcome. For instance I can develop a new product maybe other companies never think about this. The unconventional ways base on the common ways will make a successful business so I tend to combine these two ways to accomplish my own business.
