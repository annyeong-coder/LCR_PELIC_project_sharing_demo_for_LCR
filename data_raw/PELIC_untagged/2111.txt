ANON_NAME_0 Writing 3F Final Draft ANON_NAME_1 Heiben My Writing Habits I think my writing environment is very important. I don't like to write alone so I go to the library to write with my friends. If I can't concentrate I sometimes listen to classical music to help me to focus on writing. I like a formal place when I write. For example I always write at a desk. I also want a quiet place when I write. Before I write it's necessary to turn off the TV and the radio so I can finish my work. Therefore a good composition is formed by the writing environment.
