Nowadays many people know how to ride the bicycle but who taught them Of course it has to be their parents their friends . . . Etc. However the way to teach how to ride the bicycle it has many way such as make the kids to learn how to ride by themselves let them decide how to ride let them make mistakes in while they're learning. First of all I was learning how to ride the bicycle when I was 5 years old. My dad let me decide how to ride and let me make mistakes while I was learning. The result was I got many sore and some scar. However I'm not sad that I got sore or scar. Every time that I look on them I always thinking about my dad and the moment that he taught me. It is the valuable memory for me. Moreover while I was learning my dad always stay beside me and cheer me up every time that I fell down. In conclusion I think the best way to teach how to do something to someone is let them do by themselves that will makes they know how to do it. Don't worry about mistakes. Everyone used to do the mistakes. No one never did a mistakes.
