I have seen my girlfriend for nine years. We used to argue but we have not had any argument since Oct 2004 because I had to do my military service. After she got into a college which is located far away from my hometown we have not had enough time to meet each other. She wants to be a nurse so she has studied nursing for two years. It is difficult to get a job in my country because the economy in my country has been bad since 1990s. Because English is the most important to get a job these days in my country I came here to learn English. I have been Pittsburgh for three months and my brother has been Pitt since 2006. That's why I came to Pittsburgh. I have met new friends and teachers since I came here.
