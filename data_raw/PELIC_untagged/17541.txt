One of the things that I don't like in the US is that when I buy something I expect to pay the price that is written but eventually I need to pay more because of taxes. What I like in Pittsburgh is that almost all bus drivers are very polite and affable. However what I don't like about Pittsburgh buses is that when you pay the driver doesn't have change and if you don't have exactly 2 or 2. 50 You will give the last 20 dollar bill that you have or go walking. What I really hate is how cold Americans put the air conditioning. One thing that I like in the US is that Americans always use credit or debit cart and that I can pay with my card almost everywhere which is very convenient. What I really don't like in the US it that health care here is very expensive. One thing that I love in Pittsburgh is how Americans look after the city appearance how they keep streets clean and grass beautiful etc. Another thing that I love in Pittsburgh is that people smile very often which always cheers me up.
