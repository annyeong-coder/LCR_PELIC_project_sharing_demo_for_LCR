When I was a high school student. One day I was taking a Korean History class. I was not interested in History so I felt boring of the class. Suddenly I banged my head on the desk and after that I knew I was dozing off. Unfortunately I was sit down in front of the teacher's desk so I thought he might be heard that the sound of my head banged on the desk. I was very embarrassed but I have to do something so I thought it's better that pretended the fallen asleep. I decided and just doing that. I never moved my head from my desk until the class was over. Of course my classmates were all knew about my trick so they giggled through of the class. After our teacher went out the classroom I can moved in my seat barely. Wow it was very hard time that I ever experience. I didn't imagine about do not moved at atll can be painful. In my breaktime I wanted to wash my facem so I was walked the restroom. When I came back one cold coffee can is on my desk. I was wandered who was bring here for me so asked one of the classmate and she said to me that Korean History teacher just left that coffee for me. I was very impressed and felt sorry for him. After graduated high school whenever I visited my high school I met him and we talking about that time. Isn't he a great teacher
