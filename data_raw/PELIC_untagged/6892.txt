In my opinion I think it is normal to throw away something that is still in usable condition because of following reasons. First of all the thing might not be appropriate for you in someday. When I was junior high school age for instance I had hip hop style of clothes. After entering senior high school my style was changed by not only age but also effects of friends. Therefore hip hop clothes did not be suitable to me and was thrown away. Moreover if the thing has some flaw it might face to be thrown away. For example I do not like my laptop working too slow. Hence I will change a new random access memory when the larger random access memory come out. In both of situations I mentioned above either hip hop clothes or random access memory does not be damage but I still throw them away. Actually throwing away something that is still in usable condition is not wrong but the most important is how or where you throw them away. I always give the thing that is still useful to a person who might need that. Therefore even though you throw away something that still useful they will not become another pollution.
