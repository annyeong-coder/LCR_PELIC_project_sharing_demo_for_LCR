By 1997 on January I HAD TREAVELED in Hongkong. At that time Hongkong HAD NOT RETURNED to China. Therefore I HAD BEEN VISITING Hongkong for one week. Actually from Taiwang to Hongkong isn't so far. SO I told my best friend we can visit Hongkong again . How ever we HAD NEVER VISITED Hongkong again. I hope I can travel other countries with my best friend soon.
