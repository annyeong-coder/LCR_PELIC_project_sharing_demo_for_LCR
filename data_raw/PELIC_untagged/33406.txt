Every people will have sad times. Someone recover from them very soon while the other usually keep staying in sad. However may be they never realize that just like rings are connected to each other sadness may causes another sadness if you keep being sad. First of all always being sad may makes you lose your confidence. People would not be successful if they were not confident. Thus it will be another sadness when they fail in something. For instance I have a Chinese friend who is poor at Chinese writing. So every time we had to write he felt very sad because he thought he would get a low score again. With this negative implication in his mind he didn't have any confidence to improve his writing skill. Therefore he just gave up thinking and got a low score in the end and then he became more and more inconfidence. It's really a negative cycle isn't it Moreover sadnesses may cause health problems. Always being sad is a kind of mental problem. Patients who are with this mental problem will never smile because they can only see the negative aspects of one thing all the time. However a scientific study also shows that mental problems are easy to cause physical problems because once a person has many negative emotions their immunities will be decreased a lot. . That means sadness will not only affect people's mental health but also make people unhealthy in physical. It will be absolutely a biggest sadness because we loss our health! For example my grandma once was told that she had a cancer when I was 15. So she was sent to the hospital and had an operation. After the operation my grandma was optimistic and never thought about the harms of the cancer. However the woman stayed next to her was so sad and never went out to meet the sunshine. Nowadays my grandma becomes very healthy and the disease never hurt her while the other woman is still staying in the hospital. Last but not the least sadnesses may sometimes lead to bad relationships with others. Which kind of people would you like to talk with A person who always smiles or a person who carries a sad face all the time The answer is definitely obvious. If you don't have opportunities to communicate with others how can you learn about others and become friends with them Can you imagine a person without friends Isolation lonely and no place to release pressures and concerns how sad the person is! In short it is true and horrible that sadness will lead to more sadnesses just like a chain of rings. It will make you become inconfidence have bad effects on your health and ruin your relationships with others. So please give up the sad chain of rings and make a happy chain of rings !
