I'll write down about my strengths and weaknesses as a writer. I think I'm good at organization to compare to other things that are grammar vocabulary and creative. Actually I'm not good writer. But I'm trying to writer well. And now my writing is much better then before. When I wrote paragraph I tried to separate introduction body and conclusion as essay. Secondly I use many kinds of support ideas. So it made my writing stronger. The other hand I couldn't analyze myself. When I saw my essay I didn't know what I should correct them. And I wanted to use various vocabularies. Finally I should cover my weaknesses so I should make my writing stronger.
