What Aspects Affect of Happiness Everyone wants to be happy but how to get happiness It is the mystery. Some people have big fortunes but they are not happy. Others who live a life of poverty enjoy their life very much. Some people acquire happiness because they get three elements of happiness physical emotional and psychological health. First of all physical health is a basic condition to enjoy the happy life. A person can have a great deal of money but it doesn't mean that he possesses a happy life. For instance my neighbor who made a big fortune by investing money in the stock market but he can't do his favorite exercise and give his friends a hand when they need help due to the health reasons. Therefore he loses the chance to feel the happiness of taking care of others and build up his self confident through sports. Moreover emotion is the resource of feeling happy. Some people think happiness needs a lot of external conditions but others achieve happiness so easy. Because they know how to adjust their emotion to be happy of course they get the happy life. For example one of my friend who lives a very terribly life because she is always seek the luxury cars and bags. Once she gets her favorite things she will be very happy otherwise she complains everyday about she can't afford her happy . In contrast another of my friend pursuits of the life enrichment so she can live a happy life by optimistic attitude. Last but not least more and more people begin to be concerned with their psychological health because they know this is significant to achieve their happiness. Since a lot of authoritative reports show that the psychological health not only affects our happiness but also relates to our physical condition people try different ways to assist them to be in a good condition. All in all physical emotional and psychological health are indispensible factors of happiness. However it is difficult for everyone to balance these three aspects.
