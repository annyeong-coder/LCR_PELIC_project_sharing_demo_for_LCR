I met my friend ANON_NAME_0 when I was studying at the University. We were in the same classes. I was sitting at my desk when she came and asked my name. She is very talkative and easygoing person. We started talking and while we were talking we discovered that we had a lot of similar interest. We became a good friends. She was very supportive when I was studying I was working in the company as a secretary she didn't work but she always waited to do homework with me. When we finished our career she moved to her hometown and then I moved to EE. UU. But we are still in contact.
