The worst eating experience I have ever had happened 2 or 3 years ago. When I graduated from the high school I invited my parents to have a dinner which was completely different about our food. I prefer not to tell the restaurant or the food culture. By the way the waiter gave me the menu to order what I prefer. I spent around 20 minutes to think about my favorite food because it was the first time for me to try these kinds of food. The order lasted around 45 minutes to be prepared. One of the dishes was mixed grill cocked by another culture I prefer to disclose its name. When I tried the grill its taste was cold and dessert I thought I was eating baklava. I was embarrassed with my parents because they didn't eat the food because it was disgusting and expensive. I should've never invited anyone to try food I had never tried before.
