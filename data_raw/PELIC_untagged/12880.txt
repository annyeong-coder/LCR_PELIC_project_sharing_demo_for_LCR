This article is about the U. S. Tobacco companies encourage people to smoke and they utilize many ways to allure children to smoke. They sell tobacco overseas to expand their business. First American tobacco companies give many giveaways as the promotions. Adolescent succumb to the cigarettes because they are free. Otherwise there are many cigarettes commercials on TV and the companies spend a lot of money to sponsor sports. Then many children think smoke is a sign of American style but actually the United States has the lowest smoking rate of the population. Many foreign children have this kind of wrong thoughts because the advertisings of tobacco focus on American lifestyle and the commercials seen as a way of learning American cultures. Finally the U. S. Government uses Section 301 of the old trade Act to force many countries to open cigarette market such as Japan and Taiwan and this causes the rate of smoking has increased in these countries. It likes American tobacco companies do not care about the death of foreign countries and it is unfair to these Asian countries. In my opinion as a smoker there is another reason that the smoking rate of children is increasing besides the reading passage. The reason is teens want to be similar to peers they will learn how to smoke when they see their classmates are smoking. For example I have learned how to smoke since I was a high school student I tried to smoke when I saw my friends were smoking. Moreover I completely agree Sunil Ramanathan who is the example of the article. It is very difficult to quit smoking I have tried several times but I never succeed.
