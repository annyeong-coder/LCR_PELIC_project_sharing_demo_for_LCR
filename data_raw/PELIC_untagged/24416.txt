Child poverty According to the Oxford University Dictionary poverty is the state of being extremely poor or the state of being insufficient in amount. Thus child poverty means when a child fails to meet the minimum acceptable standard of life. This particular issue has been raised as a critical dilemma around the world since it is a global issue in both devolved and developing countries. Also of the world's 1. 2 Billion people living in poverty more than 600 million are children UNICEF The State of the World's Children 2000 . Therefore activists and organizations have established programs and held a number of campaigns to address the effects of poverty on children. According to Make Child Poverty History which is an organization aiming to create lasting positive change in the lives of children in need around the world Poverty has a major influence on health care and basic education for children around the world . Thus health care and education are the most important factors which have enormous influences to the poor children. One of the most influential consequences of child poverty is the lack of health care. According to the United Nations Children's Fund UNICEF report there are 68 deaths per 1 000 live births in 2007. This number of deaths should not be accepted especially when many of these deaths are preventable and can be afforded by providing basic health care services. Furthermore poor children are suffering from many diseases such as malaria AIDS. As a result of these diseases their life will change and they will not have the same opportunities as healthy children. Moreover parents might think gaining money illegally to save their children's life which means the number of crimes will increase. Also if those children had not gotten a remedy diseases would have spread around and illness will be rampant. Thus all the wealthy countries should consider this issue as a serious matter and contribute to all the organizations that take care of poor children because everyone in the world deserves to obtain basic health care regardless of his ability to pay for it. In addition to the health care provide a basic education is not less important since children are the future for every nation. Also the only means to lead and succeed in the future is to be educated. However for poor Child it is another story since they are forced to work and help their family to remain alive. As a result those children will grow without education and they will not find a job in the future since they will compete with educated youths. Moreover according to wells Grain because of the unequal educational opportunities failing public schools and the inability of many poor families to pay for a higher quality private education children of poor and minority parents are more likely to struggle in school than are their wealthier white peers Wells Crain 1997 . Therefore it is safer to the government to provide free public schools for those children who live at or below the poverty level to prevent them from being criminals on the future. In conclusion after addressing all the negatives impacts of children poverty governments should take serious action to solve this issue since it has a vast influence in society. Moreover every child deserves to have the essentials of clean water health care and basic education. Also children should be considered as the future and the society should participate to help them.
