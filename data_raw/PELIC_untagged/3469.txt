The technology must be a great help to our society so we can't live without it any longer. However if students study at home just through technology without any relationship with any friends it could cause bad effects to them. Learning something is more than just having some knowledge. We just can learn about the relationships with friends as well as with the elders at traditional school. Also we can learn how to cooperate with friends and how to socialize ourselves. With studying through the computer or television we will never find what the relation is. So we must not study at home just through the technology. In conclusion students must study at a traditional school and must learn the socializing way with others. This could be the best way of education.
