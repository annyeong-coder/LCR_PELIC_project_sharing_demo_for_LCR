These Days we have festival that is called Eid AL daha that we slaughter sheep on this day. We do it that thanks god because the God safes ANON_NAME_0. The length of festival is three days . I like this festival more than others especially when I meet my family in my country. Usually the Father who is responsible about slaughter sheep . Most of families go to their village where they meet together. Also they bring food and beverage which eat together.
