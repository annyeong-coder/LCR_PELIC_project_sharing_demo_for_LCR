Have you ever considered whether you should travel with someone or by yourself people don't like to be alone. In the other hand people like to take trip by themself. First of all solo travel is more flexible than with someone. When you go to travel with your friend if you want to change your plan you have to ask your friend about changing your plan. In addition although you want to go to place A if your friend wants to go to place B you ill make to argue with your friend. If your friend is sick during trip you can not go out on that day. However although solo travel is more flexible sometimes you will be lonely. And solo travel often invites crime. So you can choose either solo travel or travel with someone. I think depending on the situation it is different. So you have to choose an appropriate travel style. But you don't need to consider whether you travel alone or with someone. Because almost travels are exciting even if it has some problem during the travel. So almost travelers love trip. . Moreover If you want to go to some place you can go anywhere even if you are alone or with someone. In addition you can make many friends and you can make many experiences while you have trip neither alone or with someone. As a result I think it is not important whether you travel alone or with someone. If you want to go to travel just enjoy your trip.
