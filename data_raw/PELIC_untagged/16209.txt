The most famous Libyan myth which is considered as the strangest myth in my country is called Red Ghost. It is thought that complete family was killed in their house by unknown killer. After a plenty of time their house was attacked by their ghost since that time the house is considered as the most scared house in my city. So the local Libyan government is decided to buy this house and use it as a police station. Maybe because my government is thought that our policemen are capable to fight with the ghost easily. Although most of houses that surrounded by this house are still scared about this place. In my culture people are believed that any person is arrested by policeman and took to the jail he might be attacked by the Ghost.
