I got a phone call from Art Institute yesterday. They wanted to give me some information about their academy shcools but at that time I was in the point of dinner so I made them call back tommorow. When the day become tomorrow they called back and kept on talking. Suddenly my mother on down stairs called me so I asked them to hold on and answered to my mom and come back. I wrote down some important informations. There were a few words I couln't understand but I looked up dictionary and finally figured out.
