I love to learn new idea because the process makes me experience. By 2003 I had started to learn some skills how to teach children English. It was very challenging but I hadn't considered giving up. I also had made some friends in the class thus I had introduced to teach English in kindergarden from my friends by 2004. I had been teaching and I had getting along well with children for one year by 2006. It was a wonderful experience for me and I think it also can help me to apply a master of education in the future.
