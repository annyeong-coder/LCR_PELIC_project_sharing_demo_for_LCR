In my opinion practicing a sport is a good thing to do everyday but not for a several hours. First It is good to your health. For example if you are practicing swing you can improve your time to get oxygen for sake yourself. Because of this you are going to feel less tired in yours normal days. Also if you practice swing everyday you can get fit. Practice sport is a good thing to do for your own health.
