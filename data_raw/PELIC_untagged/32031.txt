Self helpe is the best help I think it's true to have any thing that you need by your self. Therfor you will be more confident. Also If each one depend on his self he will accquire more experince frome his mistakes so he will not be confuse when any problem face him in the future. For example solving a homework is most important to do it alone. So do not aske anyone to solve your homework. In here I will state this story to explain this sentence. When one poor man was walking around to find a food because he was so hungry . He met someone who was rich and he begged him some money to buy some food. The rich man said what is up man you can not find job to have money but the poor man said no I can not . Then the rich man gave him money and toled him that you should depend on your self and no one will help you . After that the poor man went to find a job.
