2 I lived with my parents and my siblings who you've met. 5 My brother who I hardly ever saw slept on the living room couch. 6 It was a large old couch which my father had made it himself. 7 My best friend who I loved her family lived across the hall. 11 They sold delicious bread and cake which people stood in line for hours to buy. 12 My brother and sisters whom I miss live far away now.
