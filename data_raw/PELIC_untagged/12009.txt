I like movies except something with a lot of action or a hair raising thriller. Now I'll write about Harry Potter series an SF film filled with force based the novels written by J. K. Rowling living in England. It's an adventure story about a wizard named Harry Potter left an orphan is keeping fighting against Voldemort who killed his parents. Harry is the archetypal hero who is not a real person rather it's an idealized human whose power is beyond other people. These movies run more than two hours because the original stories are also long however all of which are not boring and you do not fell asleep in the middle of them. It's not just an enjoyable movie but a work that makes you feel keenly the importance of human including wizards relationship. I'm looking forward to the next movie in which Harry can seek revenge for his parents.
