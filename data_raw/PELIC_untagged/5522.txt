A time when you ran out of money I have run out of my money since I first time went to a book's store of the university of the Pittsburgh. One day I just wanted to buy my text books for ELI. I did not know that the book's store sale some wonderful paints postcards too. So when I came saw a lot of oil paints for Pittsburgh in the book's store I thought I had to buy them which present more Pittsburgh's stories that detail show few conventional buildings at Pitt and a couple of famous persons such as Andy Warhol. I imaged if I mailed them to my parents my parents would be really happy. Then I paid attention to choose exciting scenes of the paints and tree pieces of color paper. The paints were wrapped by the color paper. Totally I came down with my money. My Got it spent 167. 00 Too much money. I just left 3. 00 Could not buy any books. How could I do Personally I can't control my habit for crazy to spend money.
