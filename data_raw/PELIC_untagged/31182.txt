4 What other things can people do if they want to have a long life People can have a long life by the factors that mentioned in the passage. In my perspective there are also things can people do after they get retired. They have the ability to pursue the joyful life without thinking to the age number. During work years many people want to do some activities while they keep working. Traveling in a long vacation own a project to make another source of income are some examples. The fact that they cannot do some of these is because they didn't have the flexibility in their work life. In the golden years and after the retirement people are able to do everything that they couldn't do in the past. For instance they can to start with a successful project they want it before and they also have a long vacation that make them travel and relaxed and that can make them compensate their energy that was drained. By doing so this will liklihood make people get a long life.
