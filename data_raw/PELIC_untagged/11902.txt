Hi everybody. Let me introduce myself. My name is Shawn. I'm from Korea. I have been here for 7 months. I came here because I want to speak English very well. However I can't speak English very well. Now I am leaving in Shadyside. I am leaving with my roommate who is Ken. My roommate is ELI student too. My hobby is playing computer games. When I have break time I usually play computer games. I like watching movies. Especially I like thriller movies. I want to finish ELI level 5. I want to get good TOEFL score until this coming Nov. Later I will apply university. I hope I studied in University of Pittsburgh.
