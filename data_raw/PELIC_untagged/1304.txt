There are 2 men one in the left from the U. S. And the other on the right from an Arabic country. Both of them seem leaders of their countries. While they are sitting they are playing. The American is playing checkers and the Arabic leader is playing chess. I think they are ignoring their people demand by wasting the time in playing the chess and checkers. They are supposed to solve the crisis around the world not wasting the time in seeing each other.
