Today I want to tell you some advice for enjoy your school life. First if you make PITT ID you can get busses without paying money. It's good for us to make PITT ID because if we don't have PITT ID we have to pay 1. 75 Per time. Second if you want to go shopping you can go Water Front. There are a lot of stores for clothes foods sports goods etc. Third when you want to see night view you ought to go to Mt. Washington. It's really beautiful. ELI has tours to go to Mt. Washington down town Strip district and other places. You can enjoy and know many place if you take ELI tours.
