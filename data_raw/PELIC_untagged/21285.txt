I definitely believe that there is a need for a group like PETA. Because scientists usually only focus on their research during their work. They only give importance to success and solving problems. Therefore they can ignore dangerous results for humanity or natural enviroment. For example they work on nuclear energy to produce cheaper more energy sources but they can destroy humunity or natural environment. To sum up there is a need for these groups like PETA and we have to support them.
