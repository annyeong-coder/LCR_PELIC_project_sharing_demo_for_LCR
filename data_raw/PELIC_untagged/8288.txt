There are two reasons why Nickell is suspectable of Annette martin's psychic abilities 1. She told us in this one case the guy was wearing white and he wouldn't be found in California. Was that all she told several hours Or were there lots of other things and those are being forgiven Nickell asks. We call it retro fitting. 2. It's probably perfectly sincere not an act. But it's just the facility of a highly imaginative and emotional person and doesn't mean anything scientifically. Says Nickell.
