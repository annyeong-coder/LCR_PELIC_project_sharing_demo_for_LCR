Everybody during his life has three parts. Past present and future. The past and present I can talk about but the future I can just predict about. So for me the past was very interested because when I was young I didn't use to have a responsibility but now I have. First of all I was as a student at preliminary school I studied in a school that was beside my home for that I hadn't problem about transportation. I was spent most of my time for study played with my friends I and my family used to visit my grandma and grandpa. Also I didn't use to have mobile phone because my country didn't use this service before. After high school I attended to faculty of engineering and studied BS. C for five years and MS. C for four years after I finished my MS. C degree I became faculty staff member. My dream was to get Ph. D in my major. Today I am going to apply for a lot of my dreams that I want to do in these days I study English Language as a second language in ELI school after that I am planning to get Ph. D degree in civil engineering I study everyday except Wednesday and weekend but really I have no enough time to another thing such as I study for TOEFL exam but I can't make equality for TOEFL study and ELI assignments. But I try to do all my best to achieve to my target. Now my life is so hard than before I have more responsibility than before especially because I married and I have to have a Justice between my family and my study. Today I must do everything individually without any assist from another one. This time is to demonstrate my ability to do what should I do for the other people.
