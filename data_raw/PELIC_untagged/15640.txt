Planting an apricot tree is so enjoyable. I planted many times when I was about 14 years old with my grandfather in our big garden. Actually being minimum 2 people makes planting an apricot tree easy. According to my experience it is so easy and funny to plant a tree if you follow the next steps. First select an appropriate area that has been cultivated before because this kind of soil type increases efficiency then our apricot tree will be grown healthy. Second we need to make a hole in adequate size because it is variable. As I said we minimum need 2 people to make it easy 1 person can hold the apricot tree as I did and another person can make a hole and proceed the process of putting the tree into the hole as my grandfather did. It was like an important operation because me and my grandfather were so careful and we need to cooperate. Fill the space of the root of the tree. You should be careful about it and try to avoid putting big stones or big pieces of soil. They may effect on its growing negatively. After filling the hole with soil the next step is putting manure which is mixed in water and which is indispensable in order to gain high efficiency in growing. Finally we have two more fundamental but also significant steps those are putting a stake and watering the plant. Put the stake near to the tree to prevent damage that may occurred by strong wind. Of course we need to make a connection by a robe in order to make it firm as we did. By the way it may be chosen to be resistant to rain snow in order to has a long life or should be under the control and be checked routinely. As a result according to my experience planting a tree especially apricot tree is so enjoyable. Being experiences with soil and planting trees are also very good experience and allow you to relax. With these step it is easy for you.
