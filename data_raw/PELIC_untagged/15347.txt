My best friend Rachel who is a nice girl from Michigan has many similar interests as me. She likes to go shopping and to swim each week. She lives in a big house which is located in a safe area. She hates being alone so much that she often invited me to her house. Rachel is a person whose friends are all important and special to her. She always likes to make friends who have good personality.
