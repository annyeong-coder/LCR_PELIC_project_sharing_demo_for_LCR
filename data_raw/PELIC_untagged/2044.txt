Indent Each language has own vocabulary and to speak this language you have to know these words or vocabulary. So focusing in vocabulary is an important way to improve your skills in English. For people who are studying English as a Second Language not easy for them to learn right away because this might be is completely different beside their own language. However I think you should focus your time learning vocabulary to improve your skills in English. For example if you are going to study in academic classes you need to know a lot of words to help you understand the lecture. In addition there are a lot of places having their own words or vocabulary which require to knowing these to make your self be comfortable while you are talking about something you are not familiar with. I think knowing as much vocabulary as you can helps you to accomplished learning English very well
