I dont agree that Television newspapers magazines and other media pay too much attention to the personal lives of famous people. All media pay to much attention for any topic that attracts people and grab their attention. For example if the trend nowadays is about fashion TV newspapers and other media will mostly concentrate on fashion and designs. Media give more attention to the news and the recent activities all around the globe.
