I was born and raised in Kuwait which is in Asia and exactly located in the Middle East . The place where I grew up in is extremely hot and sunny. Kuwait is well known for its capacity which is very small. The most popular hobbie in Kuwait is car tunning which I became in love with and started to dedicate my self to. I spent most of my time in the place where I grew up in learning about cars.
