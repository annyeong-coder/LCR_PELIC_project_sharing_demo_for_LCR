When I got an interview for job I met with boss. When I wanted to come to Pittsburgh he gave me the chance and let me take a vacation for one year. When I was preparing to come to Pittsburgh he helped me with many things. For example He gave me a lot of information about Pittsburgh. My boss was very nice when I was preparing to come to Pittsburgh.
