Causes of happiness 5S Shima Honami state of well being characterized by emotions ranging from contentment to intense joy ANON_URLSPAGE_which is a definition of Happiness . Of course I want to feel happiness all the time. Because when I feel happiness I can work more productively and I can communicate with other people with tender heart. There are several causes of happiness for me. First I feel happy when I eat very tasty food. Eating good food is one of my favorite things to do and it makes me smile a lot. Since my mother is a very good cook I could have incredibly tasty meals every day. For example on every Christmas days my mother makes for us pumpkin soup yummy roasted chicken and baked sweet potato. Whenever I eat her Christmas meal the taste brings me back various good special memories of Christmas. These memories make me so happy. Furthermore listening to wonderful music also makes me happy. Regardless of what kinds of music I like to listen to great music since I can relax and feel good. My favorite artist recently is Emanuel Pahud who is a principal flute player of Berlin philharmonic orchestra. He is an incredible musician. Especially his CD of BACH is amazingly good! Since I am majoring in performing the Flute his performance always motivates me a lot. In addition his performance makes me calm and feeling free. Because of these reasons after listening to his music I can study more and concentrate on anything more. In conclusion although I think it is very difficult to clarify what are the specific causes of happiness for everyone since it is related to each person's emotion eating tasty food and listening to good music are the causes of happiness for me.
