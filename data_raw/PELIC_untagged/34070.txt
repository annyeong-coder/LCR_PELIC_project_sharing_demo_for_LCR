I recommended that the people ought to work less and had a leisure time. However some people may argue this because they will say if you work hard you promote as will. I understand everyone challenge him self sometimes to be successful or satisfied in his career life. In fact the work is not every thing in our life we have a lot of other responsibilities for example family assume. I have a story for this situation and it was happened with me. My father is the general manger for the Ministry of Employee. So he used to attend many conferences. Moreover our relatives live for away from us. One of my father duties to spend one year out side my country and I was 12 years old that time. Actually I do not have any brother just 4 sisters. This year get a bad impact for my sisters because they miss my father safe for period of time. In addition it was so difficult to my father to give the security back to my family due to his absences. Further more the demand of the rest is needed for everyone. Thus it is essential that the body have a several leisure time within the work time. Also if we do not get the leisure time we will have many assumes such as our health will affected badly have more pressure so that the concentration will not as good as instead of having carefree time. I know some one who was always tried to work hard and prohibited him self from any vacation. When he retired from his job he notices the loss of his health. As a result he has many health problem until now.
