Nowadays in Russia phone scams are very common. Tricksters usually find out some information about families. Very often they pick out families with problem teenagers. Then they call one of the families pretend to be a son a nephew or a grandson by changing the voice and ask about help. For example the impostor can call you and introduce himself as your brother. If you figure out that it is lies you are a lucky person. It is easy to understand it if for example your brother is next to you or your personal question perplexes this person. In this case the impostor just hangs up and calls somebody else. If you fall for that trick and keep on the conversation you will have problems. The impostor will probably tell you that he is in big troubles he will put on an anxious voice and ask for help. He will tell you that he can count on you only and that he needs money. He will not let you think it over and clean up the situation. He can pass the phone to the police officer or another person who will talk you into giving money in order to help. Usually family is alarmed by this situation they write down the information where they have to send money and do it immediately. Later when the situation straightens up it lets people down very much. I have never had such experiences. However I heard a lot of stories when people did not look out and lost their money. My grandmother had a similar situation. Somebody pretended to be my cousin. Fortunately she watched out and figured out the lies. She did not hold on and just hang up.
