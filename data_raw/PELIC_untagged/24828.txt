My friend Patty was in a Guatemalan' parking lot with the car's windows closed. Suddenly a thief with a gun came and aimed to her through the window. What he wanted was still her car. Patty wondered whether she had to open the window and give him the keys or made up something else. What she did was to fake a heart attack. While she was trembling and dribbling the thief became more and more scared. Why the thief left the place was obvious he believe Patty's performance.
