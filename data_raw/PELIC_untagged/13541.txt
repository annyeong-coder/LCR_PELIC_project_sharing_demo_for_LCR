Two heads are better than one. Actually this expression is correct. There are many works or dreams can't done by one person but if they are done by two or more person they are great. The cooperation is good thing. For example I started studying to get masters degree after I got married. My husband assisted me to success in my studying. He helped me to take care about our kids . We help each other for living. Now he is assisting me to get my dream which get ph. D in Chemistry. Finally if he stopped help me I can't create a great work.
