Comparing my definition of Success With That of My friend Different people have different definitions of success. For instance my friend and I have different definition of success. In my case getting fame in my job is the most important thing for success. Getting fame in my job means I become an expert in my job. I'd like to make Korean sports industry improve and make important decisions for it. Therefore if I get fame in sports industry my opinion about sports industry will be important because people think importantly what famous people in that field say. In summary I think getting fame in my job is important things for my definition of success. On the other hand my friend thinks making a lot of money is the most important thing for success. He thinks making a lot of money can help him succeed many things like his children's education problems or his parents' health problems. For instance he says if he doesn't have enough money he can't do anything when his parents get sick unless he is a doctor. That's just a kind of reason he prefers making money. He doesn't care about fame because he doesn't think it's real. In addition he thinks even though he gets fame it can disappear easily. In sum he thinks making a lot of money is important for success. Therefore different people have different definitions of success.
