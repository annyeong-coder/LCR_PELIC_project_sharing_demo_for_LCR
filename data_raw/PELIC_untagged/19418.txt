When I met my friend Anita I was having an internship in the elementary school. Anita was a teacher in that school. I met her in a group meeting before the term beginning. She was preparing the meeting when I walked into the office. After we talked I found that Anita and I had a lot in common. First of all we taught in the same grade. Secondly we were graduated from the same college. Thirdly Anita and I were interested in shopping and swimming. After classes we always went out together. She was a very close friend while I was having an internship in the elementary school.
