My bedroom was a small but comfortable place in which I grew up. There was a twin size bed which I used to have a sweet dream at the middle of the room next to the bed there were two nightstand which there were two lamp on each. In front of the bed near the window there was a desk and a chair which I was used to doing homework beside the desk there was a bookshelf where I stored many fascinate books. There was a paint whose size was big on the wall.
