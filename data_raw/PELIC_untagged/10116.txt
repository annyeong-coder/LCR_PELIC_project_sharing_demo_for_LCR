Most of people need to get a rest after they had a long time at the work study or any other doing. For me I usually take a trip in the summer or the spring when the weather is good . I visit many places where I spend a lot of time. Now I will describe a trip that I have taken in 2000 in the summer. After I had a lot of studies for my Master degree I went to the beach with some friends by cars in a city named Sobrata. Sobrata is a beautiful city it has a nice beach and many antiquities. We stayed there three days. We spent much time swimming we played several games we visited many museums in the city. We interested and enjoyed a lot in that trip.
