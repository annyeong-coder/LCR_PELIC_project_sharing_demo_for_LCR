It is very interesting for me to try to figure out what cheers me up in my room. I have 3 idea to bring out the best in my room. At first I would like to hang up a picture or a painting in my room because we have nothing on our house's wall. Secondly I would like to buy another lamp to light up the apartment at night. Finally I would like to threw papers and old books away.
