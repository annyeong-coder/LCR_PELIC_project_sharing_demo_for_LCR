Today I interviewed my classmate named ANON_NAME_0. He's going to contunue studying English until he takes TOEFL. When he finish the ELI he'll go University. He'll stay in this country until he finishes his major. While he's in home he'll study hard for English. After he saves money he'll get marry.
