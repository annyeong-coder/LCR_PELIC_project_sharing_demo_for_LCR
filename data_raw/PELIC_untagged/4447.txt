I am going to make a trip to NewYork City for the weekend. First I am going to leave my house friday night and take airplane to NYC. As soon as I get NYC I will have to go to hotel to spend the night. By th time the sun comes up I am going to go to broadway to see the musical. After that I will walk to street. Then I want to look at all the people passing by me. Beacuse I want to feel the Newyorkers. At night I want to go to timesquare in order to see nightsight. The next day I will probably have to go home. It's short. But I am sure it will be a nice trip.
