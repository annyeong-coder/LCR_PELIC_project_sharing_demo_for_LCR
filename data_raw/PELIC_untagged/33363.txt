It's wonderful if I live there since there is everything such as quietness no body will disturb your privacy dancing playing golf or polo watching the sunset while you're taking your coffee and lots of facility you can had their. In contrast if everything is perfect lovely and beautiful I will be boring and no exciting at all. I'm still young I'd like to have a boisterous life. So I wouldn't live in leisureville. I think it's perfect for senior citizen who get tired form his busy life.
