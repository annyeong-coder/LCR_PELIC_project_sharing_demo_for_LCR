I have already known the MLB before I came to the US but I had never seen the MLB games when I lived in Taiwan. Last week I went to see the MLB game. When the game started I had been seeing many people in the PNC Park as a result many people were in line to buy beverages and food. When I found my seat I had bought some food such as hot dog and soda to enjoy this game. I have been loving baseball for several years so I was excited to enjoy the baseball game. By the game started Pittsburgh Pirates team had arranged many activities for all of baseball fans. In addition when I saw many happy kids they had been danced on the chairs and passages. The game started at 0715PM. By that time the Pirates parrots had participated in this game to lead everyone made a positive effect on the Pittsburgh Pirates team.
