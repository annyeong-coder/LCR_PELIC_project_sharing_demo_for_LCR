After 5 busy days in a week Friday is coming like a survivor for most of people in the United States. Obviously calling the Friday TGIF is a sign for what people do feel in this day. Unlike in my country I started have this feeling since I came to the U. S. On Friday I usually have a great time of sleep after finishing classes to can stay up late this this day. I go to see a movie at night for having fun and enhancing my language. Some days I just stay with my friends at home. On the other hand although Sunday is a day before starting anther busy week I enjoy at that day because is the football day. Since I got up at noon I just sit and watch the games from 1 PM to 12 AM. For me Sunday is similar to Friday for having fun. However Sundays will be boring when the football season is over. I feel that I do not have anything to anticipate with. At the end I think weekend's concept is the same in all countries. The different is how do people do in these days.
