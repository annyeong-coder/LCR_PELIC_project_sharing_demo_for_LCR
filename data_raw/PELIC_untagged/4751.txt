I met Jaeguen who is my best friend about fifteen years ago because we became class mates. In that time we had so different personalities that I didn't know what we became best friends. For example he was always playing soccer when I played baseball. Also I studied scientice while he was studying mathmatics. So it was hard to be close each other. Even though we were we became friends like brother through only one common what we liked video games. In fact I alway went to video game cafe after school so do him. Therefore we were able to meet almost everyday excepted weekend and we had been best friends when we couldn't recognize each other.
