The first week in Pittsburgh have many things for me to learn. Firstly Weather is the first thing that I have to understand because it can change every day of week. So I have to adapt myself in order to live with this weather. Secondly Transportation systems that take me to school confuse me even though it is effective system but it have many route and have many condition that passengers have to do such as should I pay fare after step to the bus or before step down to destination. When I go to restaurant I acknowledge American's culture to give change for waiter. It isn't necessary in my home country but I think it is a good thing to do that to people who take care us with the best service. I came to Pittsburgh not only study English language but I also learn how to live like people of Pittsburgh.
