Grey's Anatomy recommended by my friend. Grey's Anatomy of which I heard before was popular in America. This was a story about some surgery interns. Meredith Cristina George and Izzie who just left medical schools met in the same group when they started their internship. Their supervising doctor very strict gave them many rules. All of them excited first faced a lot of difficulties. For example George got a chance to perform an appendectomy a minor operation but he didn't complete it. Cristina an Asian American really wanted to do an operation and almost got the chance. She and Meredith helped an attending doctor make the correct diagnosis for a patient in critical condition. But the attending doctor who had a one night stand with Mereditrst 48 hour shift the interns having experienced complicated emotions were exhausted. However they reaffirmed their devotion to medicine. I was attracted because this sitcom includes many thrilling and exciting stories and provides exquisite details of the characters' personalities and emotions. I think I will keep watching this sitcom.
