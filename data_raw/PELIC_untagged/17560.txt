If I won 30 600 000 dollars of a lottery my life would change dramatically. First I would buy everything I have wanted for example a luxury house an expensive car clothes shoes brand bags and fine jewels. They are all what I cannot buy easily in the real life. I feel very excited to imagine this situation. However such huge money would discourage me from working hard. Consequently I might become inactive person on my perspective I can work hard because I have something I want to buy or to do. If I can buy anything it seems like to lose purposes for my life. Besides I might become suspicious and nervous because of having such a big money I would be anxious about being stolen the money or I would think everyone depend on my money. Winning such a big money is an unbelievable lucky event. However it doesn't mean necessarily that I can be happy as a result of the event. I want to win smaller money which has reality for me rather than such big money.
