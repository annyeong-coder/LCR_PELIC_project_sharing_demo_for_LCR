When I was a student in elementary school I met my best friends. We used to do homework and used to play baseball together. Then when we were students in middle school I moved to another city. So we didn't meet each other. But I used to visit his home. Also he used to send mail to me. So we have become real best friends to each other. Today I am living in Pittsburgh but he is living in Korea. And he is a university school student in Korea. It's too far to meet him. So I can't meet him when I miss him. However I believe that he will help me if I get into trouble and he believe that too.
