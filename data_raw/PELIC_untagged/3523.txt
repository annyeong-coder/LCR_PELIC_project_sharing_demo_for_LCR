This year in my city government has been building new schools. The government has already studied where it these schools. Now the government has been study how students can enjoy in the school. For example the government has building new jams for students. Some teachers have been preparing some activities for students at the schools. Also the Government has already improved some books. The government has been meeting some students and some teachers. Than they have been searching about how it can improve studying in these schools. Some families in my city have been emboldening that and also some families have helped the government. I have been thinking how I can help them.
