My room let me down and I'd like to change every thing there. Every thing tears down and need to take away. My bed is too small and I'll throw it away. I'm going to pick a new bed up. My desk is old and small and I give it up to my friend. When I'm in my room and I watch movie I can't enjoy watching because it's difficult to control the volume in turn it up or turn it down. I'll buy new picture that I'll hang it up in the wall. I'll leave out a big mirror because it shows up in all right side of my room. I'll do my room up. I'll straighten my room up.
