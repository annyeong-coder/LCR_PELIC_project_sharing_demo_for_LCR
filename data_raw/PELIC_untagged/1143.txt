Dear Karina How are you I hope that everything is ok. I'm thinking to buy the digital camera that I told you about by telephone last week. I have two good options a digital camera and a photographic camera. Today it's easier and more pratical to use the digital camera because we can see the photo at the time that we take the picture and we can delete it if we don't like it. In addiction we can first past to the computer and then decide whish photo we want to print. Those are the advantages to buying a digital camera. The other kind of camera the photographic cam has a similar price but doesn't have the advantages of the digital camera. The photographic camera isn't as practical and functional as the other one. So I think the best decision is to buy a digital camera. If you're here you could help me in my decision but that's ok you can tell me you opinion by telephone because I'll wait to buy the camera in a few months. So I'm going to wait for your answer ok I love you dear sister Love
