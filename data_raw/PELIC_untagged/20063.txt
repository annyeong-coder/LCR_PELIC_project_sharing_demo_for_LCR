I don't apply perfectly these types of personality however for me one comes closer than all the others. The category that fits me most closely is extrovert . An extrovert personality is a person whose energies are energized by being with others. I read this article's example which talked about shy person who become comfortable when he she meet others. I am going to clarify why does this type fit me. In my case basically I am an outgoing person who is always compatible with others in the social situation. Becoming comfortable with somebody is not a suitable for my pattern but being with others make me more vigorous. For example when I was working at the company I was too busy. Usually I finished my work around 10pm. Even though my work was busy I went out 2 or 3 days a week when my friends called me. When I meet my friends I eliminate my fatigue. Also I don't like to being alone which makes me tired. This is my stable habit when I am tired I always go out because of my personality. Talking with somebody is my crucial aspect. Therefore extrovert is the closest type of my attribute.
