When I was working as a news caster back in 1994 I met with my husband who was a successful businessman in Mongolia. Let me share my story little bit. One day my editor called me to his office while I was working on my news script. She asked me to take an interview with my future husband even though at that time I didn't know him will be my husband later. The Interview went well and I got an offer that was if I can do commercial for his company. There was pretty good amount of money involved so I agreed. Mostly I got late because I was doing his commercial after my job at news station. He always wait me even he had nothing to do. We had dinner together all the time while I was working on his commercial. Sometimes he drove me to my home. After the commercial had done I started doing my routine job which is broadcasting news. He always sent little note that told me how was my news or how good I looked on air. We started talking to each other on the phone all the time. All the sudden we got very close to each other without even realized. We got engaged 1996 and got married in same year. Had a baby boy in 1997 while I was working as a reporter. In 2006 we moved to America and had our second son Simonne in Sep 2008. I can't believe that it has been 13 years already since we got married. But our love to each other got more and more.
