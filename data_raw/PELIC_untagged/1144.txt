The best meal experience I have ever had happened around 3 years ago. I went to Chinese restaurant with my friend to eat there. I ordered an Egg flower Soup bowl. It contains beef and vegetables with egg in a meat broth. I liked it too much. I ordered a Dragon and the Phoenix dish. It contains shrimp and sliced chicken with garden vegetables. That dish was delicious. My friend ordered a dish of rice with two chunk of lamb meat. He ordered Lemon Chicken. It is fried chicken was served on a bed of lettuce with a zesty lemon sauce. I order a dish of fruit which contains avocado orange and apple. After we had our dinner we had two cops of Chinese tea while we were speaking. We enjoyed that Chinese food so much. I would like to go there again.
