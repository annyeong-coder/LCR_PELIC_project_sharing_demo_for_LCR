The food in my country is less expensive than the food in the United States. Also in my country it s more delicious than in the United States. But the meals in my country are not healthy as good as the meals in the United States. Also the fruits and vegetables in the USA are fresher than the fruits and vegetables in my country. However the meat tastes in my country is more delicious then the meat tastes in the United States but in the United States the seafood testes as good as the seafood in my country. Finally the meal in my country is spicier than the meal in the United States
