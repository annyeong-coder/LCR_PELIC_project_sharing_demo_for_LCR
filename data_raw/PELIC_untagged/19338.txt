I have an important person for me. He was my English teacher when I was junior high school student. When I met him in my shool he was smiling a welcome. I was surprised because it was common that teacher had an expressionless in Japan. When he taught us English I was studying English smillingly. I was able to get an good score in English. I really apreciate him very much. I was thinking about the way to study English when I met him after the class. He said to me '''You should study desperately'' with smile. I cannot forget his saying . He is important person for me still now.
