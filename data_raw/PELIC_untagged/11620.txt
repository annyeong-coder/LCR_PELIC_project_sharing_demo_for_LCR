Dear Mr. ANON_NAME_0. Hello This is JunHee ANON_NAME_1 who is one of the ELI students in Pitt. Last time when you help us in the library it was really great time for all of us. My class mates and I really appreciate it. We got a lot of useful information out of that time. If I come to go to pitt I will must use the program which you introduced and enjoy all of my assignment with the program. Again thank you so much for helping us and take care. Sincerely JunHee Last Name
