Learing a new language is very difficult because every on has the native language in his brean as a basic system. So if we want to change this background we should send a lot of time to do that. However one things I am warried about is learing a new language by wrong way. For example when we learn a new language like english some people try to translat a new word by using his native language. My advice to every one try not to translat a new word. We have to know the meaning of the word from the text and from by using the same language that we are learing.
