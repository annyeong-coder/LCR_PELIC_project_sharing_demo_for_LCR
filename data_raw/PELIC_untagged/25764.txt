I think many peaple enjoy trying unusual dishes . It is exciting to know many types of foods and cultures . According me no I don't . Because I am ellergic to many kinds of food . For example sea food. And always unusual dishes have strange smell this make food unacceptable to me . Acully I tried once but I couldn't complete it .
