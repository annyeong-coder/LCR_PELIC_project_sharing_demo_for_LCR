My office is dark. While I looked into some books how I should change my office I saw I should change to start from furniture. So I want to change my furniture. I want to pick out blank color cover for my new furniture. I am looking up to buy a new furniture online. Besides I want to hang up some pictures which is drawed by Picasso. His pictures cheer me up. I think to turn my desk around to the window. In addition I want to paint my offices wall to another color because the color of the wall birng me down. I think to set a sound system up in my room to listen music.
