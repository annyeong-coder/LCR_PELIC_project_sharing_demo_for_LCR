I remember my room it's contains of big sofa in front of the room door. And there are clothes safer in the left side. Also I have a small TV in front of the sofa. In the right corner there is a fish container. In the floor there are tow small blue rags. In the left corner there is a lovely tree in wonderful garden faze. In the front wall there is a lovely red old watch belong to my grandmother.
