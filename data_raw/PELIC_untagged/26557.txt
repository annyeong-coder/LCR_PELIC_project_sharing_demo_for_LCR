Studying in the United States is a great opportunity because U. S has an excellent education all over the world. The initial reason for me to come and study in the United States is to complete my Master degree in a good university and to improve my English language. Actually I have a scholarship from my government which requires me to complete my Master degree in three years so my target day is in 2013. They send me to the U. S because it has a lot of good universities all over the world. Before I start studying my Master degree I must work hard to improve my English so I study in ELI to acquire all the English skills. ELI offers me a good chance to achieve my goal it teaches me all the important skills in English. I found that studying English is interesting but it is challenging too because some grammar or words don't relevant to our native tongue. There are obvious differences between English language and my native language such as the structure of the grammar and the writing form. I hope that I will achieve succeed in learning English and start my academic study at an excellent university as soon as possible.
