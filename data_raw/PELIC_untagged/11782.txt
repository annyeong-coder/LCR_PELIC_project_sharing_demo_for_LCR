Stereotypes have a long history and exist commonly in many societies today. People tend to judge other people based mainly on which ethnic group or nationality they belong to. Stereotypes have both good and bad effects. Sometimes these steroeotypes are very helpful but often they are negative and harmful. On the one hand stereotypes are helpful. Because they are formed with a developing stage. People got some impressions and ideas from communicating with other people from different ethnic or nationality. They usually summarized and found some general rule about other people with different ethnic or nationality. Generally speaking stereotypes are helpful when people judge other people from different groups or nationalities because they can get quick impression and reaction how to deal with other people especially when people didn't have many knowledge about the characteristics of other people from different ethnic or nationality people. On the other hand stereotypes are negative and harmful. Because stereotypes are not the exactly summary of characteristics of other peoples from different ethnic or nationality. People's behavior and characteristic are not the same just because they belong to one ethnic or nationality although they have many common things. People judge other people just depending on their ethnic or nationality they belong to people will make mistake and get wrong decision so these stereotypes are negative and harmful. For example people may have stereotypes of American and think all of them are rich and hardworking. In fact some people are rich and hard working but somes are not. In summary stereotypes have both good and bad effects. The important thing is how we use them. We can use stereotypes as a general imagation of other peoples but we also think about the details and individuals.
