I met my friend Ming for 4 years ago. We studied in different classes but we saw each other every morning when we were going to school. We just saw each other but we ve never talked. One day I was eating lunch in a restaurant when he came in the restaurant. While I wanted to say hello he was laughing and asking me Can I sit here and I answered Yes you can. Then we were eating lunch together. While we finished lunch his phone was ringing. The phone was calling from his mother. This was we met and talked with each other's frist time. It was easy meet for us but I've never forget to meet with my friend Ming.
