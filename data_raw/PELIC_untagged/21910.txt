My partner's name is Bomb. He is from Thailand. His major is Computer Engineering. He is living in Shadyside in Pittsburgh. He wish he could get Master's degree at a good university in the U. S. So he is studying for the TOEFL test to get into Pitt. He is hitting the books to enter a good university. I hope that he enters a good university. I'm happy to meet him at ELI Pitt.
