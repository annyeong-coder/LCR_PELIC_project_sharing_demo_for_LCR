The computer is our language on these days and my purpose of my topic was to let people think whey thy use computers because many people have computers but they don't notice their function of having them. I was trying to persuade some people to look to the function that they have computers for and if they want to buy a new computer they should look to their function of using the computer because this thing may help them in saving their money. Therefore I think my essay and my thesis statement was good to let people look to what they do not look to and encourage them to know something about computers. The overall organization of my criterions was reasonable because I started from the most important things in computers to the less. For example when you don't like the processor of a computer you will not look to the rest functions because the processor is the most important thing. So I think the organization is good in this essay. You can notice the important from the first to the second draft. On the first draft I didn't define many things such as processor RAM and DVD RW but on the second draft I did define everything and I wrote many examples to le the audiences understand what I am saying. Therefore the improvement on the second draft is noticeable. I think even if I had some mistakes in my essay it stills good because it has some ideas. For example when someone writes an essay he might look into persuading telling new information and try to connect the new information with the old informaion and in my essay I was trying to connect the audience's information and the new information with some persuading.
