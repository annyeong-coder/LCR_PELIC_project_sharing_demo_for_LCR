Before I came here I had never eaten bread because when I ate the bread I had felt sick to my stomach. But now I usually have breakfast with bread. And I had never drunken soda and coffee before I came here. But now I like to drinking soda and coffee. Also I had never eaten fast food like hamburger or pizza before I came here. But recently I prefer to eat fast food.
