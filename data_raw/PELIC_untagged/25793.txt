As a human being my skills and abilities to do many things have been growing as well as my age. For example when I was 10 years old I couldn't drive my father's car but I could drive my brother's car. In addition I wasn't able to travel alone but I was able to travel with my older brothers. Now I can travel any where alone but my little brother can't travel by himself. Also I could play cards and I still can.
