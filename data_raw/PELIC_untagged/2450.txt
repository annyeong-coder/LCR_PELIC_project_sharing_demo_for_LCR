My Life 10 Years Ago It was 1997. I had already gotten a qualification of nurse. But I had not yet been elevated to the position of chief nurse. By 1997 I had been working as a nurse for 10 years. When I worked as a nurse a city of KOBE had been having a big earthquake and many buildings were broken. So I was heeding the appeal of victim when I worked as a nurse. By the end of 2000 most buildings in KOBE had already been recreated.
