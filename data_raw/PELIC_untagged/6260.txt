The furniture in my room counts in a bed a desk and a chair. In addition there is a hang up painting on the wall. These are elements which set up my room. On bed I like tossing about when I sleep. With a desk a chair and a computer I figure out the answers of my homework. When I am writing my homework I use to toss out scrap papers frequently on the flower. I like working up in my room. After that I let out my sweaty clothes. Usually these make me feel trouble when I need to work on cleaning. A clean room always cheers me up
