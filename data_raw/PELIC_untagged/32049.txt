Traveling is my hobby. If I were able to travel to any country I would go to Italy because I like ancient civilization and Italian food. If I were in Italy I might visit the ancient buildings in Rome every day. If I were studying in Italy I would be obese because I like Italian food. I like pizza and spaghetti so much. I hope my dream comes true and visit Italy.
