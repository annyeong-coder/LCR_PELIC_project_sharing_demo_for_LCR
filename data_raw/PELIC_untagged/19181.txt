When I was dancing a bar with my friends approximately 5 years ago I met a new girl. She was friend of my friends but I didn't been seen before that night. We begin to talk about different topics then we started to dance in the bar. That night was wonderful for me. I was in love with this girl. Days later my friend told me that girl was really interested in a date. I was very surprised and I just told her this is my opportunity to impressive her! I invited her to a special dinner in a expensive restaurant then we went to a friends house and me had a wonderful night. We started a beautiful relationship. Actually We are a little separate because I'm studying English in The United States and I just enjoy the moment. I hope to see her in december but I'm not sure if our relationship keep working like in the past.
