Every year The United States of America has its own National holiday. The last Monday of May celebrate Memorial Day. The citizen enjoy three days weekend and meet their friends and relatives. Also the days remind the population previous history and what happened in wars for soldiers. So I did many activities on three days weekend. On Saturday last week was an average weekend. Because one day before I was so tired and I spent a lot of time to registering my car. After that I enjoy sleeping and relaxing till noon of Saturday. Next I woke up and cooked my favorite meal called ''Kabsah'' and I ate so much. Later I prepared a cup of tea and called my family. The second day of my weekend was wonderful. First I organized my apartment and washed my clothing. During that day I searched for a new apartment in Oakland beginning in July. At night I met my friends and went to a coffee shop called ''Caribou'' and talked and laughed until midnight. Eventually I spoke with my roommate about buying some stuff. Memorial day of The United States of America is official holiday usually happen on Monday the last day of May. Initially I went to go shopping in Giant Eagle. Also I bought some grocery from an Arabic Market. Then I was watching TV and listening to the radio. Finally I read about some aspects of the English Language and diverse method for improving language. In conclusion these week end of Memorial Day was fantastic. I did many of crucial Activities and achieve it. This holiday provide people to modify usual routine. I relaxed enjoyed meeting my friend. And read in some books. I hope to have three days weekend once a month.
