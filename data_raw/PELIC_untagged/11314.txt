Generally speaking I am an extrovert person whose energy are activated by being with others. For example when I play with my friends I am always the one who is talkative and like to organize some activities. Sometimes I am inclined to feel boring at the time when I stay with myself. At most of time I make decision relying my past experiences. I think it is necessary to figue out present ciucumstance before start the next step. I'd like to list some points which are advantage and disadvantage before making important decision which help me to go on the right way. So I think I am a sensor and a thinker. However I tend to act as a intuitive and a feeler in some special situation including love and shopping. In addition I am a perceiver I prefer to experience as much of the world as possible. But my husband is in the opposition he'd love to do something which he has been familiar to. For exmple I want to choose a restaurant where we have never been and order some new dish that we havn't tried before. On the other hand my husband always hesitate to do those. In conclusion I am the kind of person who resembles a sunflower opening to the world most of the time.
