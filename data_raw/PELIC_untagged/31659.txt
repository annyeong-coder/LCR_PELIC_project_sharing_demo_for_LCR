Food in China is more delicious than food in America. Because of American food is less variety than Chinese food and is sweeter than Chinese food. Chinese food is healthier than American food. Because of American food almost fried but China have many ways to cook food. Chinese cooking use many vegetables and fish such as my hometown fish is my main food and we have many kinds of ways to cook fish fried stew in clear soup braising with soy sauce ect. And Chinese food is cheaper than American food for example I buy the Chinese food just 4 dollars but American food should costs 8 dollars.
