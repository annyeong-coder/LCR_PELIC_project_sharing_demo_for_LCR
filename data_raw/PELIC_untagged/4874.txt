I met my friend Hazem while I was living in Syria. When I was at the secondary school I saw him. He was standing with his friends when I saw him. When we had a break I talked with him. He was surprising when I talk with him. Next two days we went out together. The sun was shining when we went out. We sat down at a cafeteria when we felt tired. And we still friend until now.
