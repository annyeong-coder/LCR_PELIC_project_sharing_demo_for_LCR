I think telling the truth is the most important consideration in any relationship. It keeps the communication going and it prevents a good relationship from ending. First telling truth makes the people in a relationship feel easy to communicate. It is very important for people in a relationship to know each other very well and to trust each other. This process can't be finished in a few days . It need a long time communication. If you lie in the communication soon or later another people will find out. Then he will assume there are more lies in this relationship. It will be easy to lose trust in this kind of situation. Finally the communication will become hard. For example if you lie to your friend and then he find out. The next time he will doubt every thing you talk about so can you talk to each other. In addition it hard to change his opinion after that. Second lies can end a relationship very easily no matter how stable it is before. People can accept mistake because they know nobody is perfect but most people can't accept lies. As long as you lie no matter how you explain people will assume that you will do it again. For example if an accompany lie to its clients about produce once and is found out the clients will end the contract. There are a lot of good company out side there is no need to trust one that lie once. A lie doesn't mean everything is bad but it can ruins every thing quickly. In simple words never lie in a relationship if it is important to you. Telling truth may be hard but it can gain trust for you which is the most important thing in a good relationship. Do your best to be honest in every communication then your relationship will never end and will become better and better.
