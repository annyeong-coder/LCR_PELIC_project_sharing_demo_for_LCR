My friend has won Bodybuilding's awards thee times since 1999. And He has been a physical trainer since 2000. He has taken exercise for 10 years. And he always has eaten foods that contain only protein since he starts to exercise. He has never eaten foods contained fats since he decides to take exercise. Then he has had time to learn some training skills for 6 years. Also He has been a student of martial arts and physical education for 4 years. By now he has been a physical trainer for 7 years and has gotten two degrees since 2006.
