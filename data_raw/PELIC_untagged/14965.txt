I was born in Pohang. I grew up in Busan Korea. The recent important thing that has happened to me is leaving Korea and moving to Pittsburgh. I left Seoul six months ago. I have lived in Pittsburgh since then. Also I have studied English at University of Pittsburgh for five months. Therefore I haven't met my father for six months. I traveled to Maldives in 2001. When I was at Maldives I tried scuba diving for the first time. Under the sea I saw beautiful coral reeves and many kinds of fish. That was very fantastic. In addition I have experienced sea fishing. It was very fun.
