Topic My favorite comic. When I was young about ten years old the comic in Taiwan was very famous. I think maybe that was a little effect from Japan's culture. At that time one of my favorite comics the name is Dragon Ball. I think maybe this comic is still famous of the world. The author's name is Akira Toriyama. He was born in Japan 1955. When he was 23 years old he joined the comic race finally he won the fresh champion. Then he begins his draw life. He drew a lot of famous comics included Dr. Slump and Dragon Ball. Until now the Dr. Slump was sold about 28 million copies. Dragon Ball was sold about 103 million copies. Now he is the authority of the comic area in Japan. Why did I very like the Dragon Ball First of all the leading role is a good man he has a lot of power to fight a bad guy which come from the alien place. Second all of the story was fill of the amazing and fantastic like the universal monsters or planets. Then every time the monster wants to attack the earth he always protects the people of earth and fights with the monster. Just like the Spider Man. So he used to be a hero in my mind when I was young. Now I still very like this comic. Dragon Ball is my favorite comic.
