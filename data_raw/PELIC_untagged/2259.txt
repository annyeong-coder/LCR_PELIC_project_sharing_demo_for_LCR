Hi my name is Macarena I am from South America Uruguay. I grew up in Rivera a city in my country. When I was a teenager my parents moved to Brazil so I spent half of my teens in Brazil. Now I am living in Pittsburgh in the U. S. I moved here from NY where I was living with my sister to live here with my boyfriend. I have been living here for two years. Pittsburgh is a very different city from what I am used to. Most of my life I have lived in big cities such as Rio de Janeiro and New York City. Pittsburgh is not an easy city of get around especially with the public transportation that Pittsburgh has. Before I moved here I did not know it was so complicated to move around this city without a car. In Pittsburgh you need a car to go anywhere and I do not drive yet. It is in my plans to learn to drive. In Pittsburgh knowing how to drive is a necessity.
