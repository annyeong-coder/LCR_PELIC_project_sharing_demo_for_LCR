I think the most unusual lifestyle is urban homesteaders. I don't really understand their belief that the fate of planet depends on creating new lifestyle. With their way of life they should live in suburban or rural if they concern about the environment. I have read about people who don't save their money in banks and never use electronic cards but I have never heard about people like urban homesteaders who deal with bartering or exchanging goods and reject using money. They try hard to live in primitive life as they could.
