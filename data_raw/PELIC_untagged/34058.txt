Despite modern world have provided useful tools in order to make things in a easier way people are still working harder and longer. Why I believe that although there are many modern devices people need to work harder by themself because they have a higher standard of life quality. Now people are less conformist and constantly want more and more. It should be better for people working less because money luxuries are not the most important things in life. People should make a change in their life perspectives and learn that leisure time it is really important to keep your brain rested. Obviously there should be a balance between work and leisure time. That will help us to come with fresh ideas and to be more productive. Personally I like to mix many activities to keep my brain active. For example I study but as well I sleep walk watch movies and play among others. That keep my life in a good mood.
