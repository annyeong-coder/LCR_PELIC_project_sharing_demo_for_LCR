First Caral was well civilized although it is old city. And the evidence from excavation work showed that Caral people had musical instruments and cotton seeds. Second Caral people had traded their cotton net to get dried fish or shellfish. In addition to they had trenches and canals to bring water to their fields but they did not take advantages based on storing large amount of food supplies. Finally Caral civilization fell and it didn't disappear overnight. They could become the center of power but they couldn't be the center. In conclusion I think they should have survived now because they had power and intelligence to continue their civilization. Therefore I only think they couldn't prepare the changes around their environment.
