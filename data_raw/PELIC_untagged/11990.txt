Language Policies in different countries should take their own policy. South Korea is well known as a homogeneous country. Everyone in my country use Korean for everything. After Korea's new president ANON_NAME_0 Myung Bak was elected our policy about language has been cleared. Make English as a second language for everyone. Our basic language is Korean which we use in government schools and everywhere but we need English as much as to survive. South Korea is a small country. For the trade and economy growth of Korea we should take more parts in world society. Knowing lots of language especially English is a basic to take parts of the national groups. I agree that we have to learn different languages such as English Chinese and Japanese. The only thing I want to say is that language policy has to be not only for uniformity but also diversity. Fortunately our country use only Korean so it is not very difficult to be united but that advantage makes hard to accept people from other countries. For example in the past even the government services only had a brochure written in Korean. They did not prepare for different language speakers. This is the problem that I want to say. If we do not consider about others we might be isolated in the world. Nowadays countries cannot survive by themselves. So Korea should accept more people in open mind and see bigger world not just our small country. Thankfully now it has been changed a lot.
