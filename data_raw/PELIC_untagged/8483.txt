The Pressure of Being a Student Being a student abroad has several benefits but it has a few disadvantages also. My brother was a student in the U. S. At the beginning he was so happy to study in the States. After a while he started to realize that he was alone and no one was with him. He wasn't focus on his studies because of that. The people are different the language is totally different and the food is different also. Then he decided to go back to Saudi Arabia. For that I think there were a lot of pressures of being students abroad missing family the different language and culture and worry about the studies. First in my opinion the most important thing every student has to face is missing their family. A lot of students think that studying abroad is fun and enjoyable. They will find it very difficult after being far from their family for a while. They will miss their home their parents and every member of their family. Second another thing every student will find difficult is the different culture and the different language. They have to use the same language the same food they eat and the same culture but know they have to deal with different language such as English language. And the food such as fast food. Third every student will be concerned about their studies. Are they going to succeed Or not. Have they chosen the right major Also they will be concerned about how much work they will have. I think they will be concerned about not having enough time to do the things they want. If they want to succeed in their lives they have to have the courage to avoid these difficulties study well and achieve something good. In conclusion studying abroad has several pressures and hard difficult moments different culture and language different people and difficulties about studies. But everyone come over it and enjoys the happy and the good moments in their life such as make new friends and enjoy the beautiful wither.
