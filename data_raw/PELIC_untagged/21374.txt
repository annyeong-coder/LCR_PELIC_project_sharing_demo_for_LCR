I would like to clarify the achievement that I got it while I have been studying at ELI and acknowledge their teaching by saying the truth. Obviously I did not expect my improvement in Learning English as a second language if I compare this current time with my retrospect. I have noticed that when I astonished many friends when I was talking English. However English language is so enormous language that I confront diverse dilemma and I feel that I achieved approximately fifty percent of learning English language. From my point of view I emerged that I am so lucky that I choosed ELI to learn English for a great deal of underlying reasons such as the methods of teaching subjects and foster students to share in many skills and activities. In addition teachers didn't inhibit the students if they did something weak or not perfect but the teachers instilled a confidence in their student and cultivate them. Also ELI has classified information that evoke for foreign students a plenty of benefits. Finally I have experienced a lot when I adapt in American culture and I have spent beautiful time in the USA that reflects to me by benefits.
