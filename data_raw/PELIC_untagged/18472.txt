When I was a child I liked to sit on my mother's legs. If I was a millionaire I will give half of it to my parents. I won't cry unless it's really painful. I brought the umbrella in case the weather changes. I don't like to eat lamb because the smell of lamb is weird. I will go home after I finish my homework. I tried to warn Joe as soon as he fell down by a twig. Once I went to Chicago with my friends I still want to go again. I can't remember your name before I met you. Although I try so hard to learn English I still can't speak it fluently.
