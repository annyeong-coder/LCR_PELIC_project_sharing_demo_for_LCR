Some people feel that children should be free to use the Internet however in my opinion the Internet should be limited for children. I feel this way because of several reasons. One of the most important reasons is that the Internet is a free zoon. This means that the Internet has materials that could be not appropriate for their age. As a result the Internet will be harmful for them if parents are not aware and do not know what their children do on the Internet. Another reason why I believe the Internet should be limited for children is that children may addict to the Internet. In addition the Internet could affect children's education and their social communication. As a result of previous harmful that the Internet could cause it for children it should be limited by parents.
