My name is Student's Name and I'm come from South Korea. I'm living in Pittsburgh also I'm studying English and Business here at English Language Institute and Community College of Allegheny Country. Now I want to introduce my name. Albert is my first name which is named by my father and mother. My classmates are using this first name to call me. Some of my friends are calling me just Al or R . Next Middle Name is my middle name. This means god's caring in Korean. When I was 7 years old my grandfather tried to change my middle name but I did't want to change it because I really like my middle name's meaning and pronounciation. Finally my grandfather gave up changing my name. My Family Last name is Last Name . Actually this family name is not common in my country.
