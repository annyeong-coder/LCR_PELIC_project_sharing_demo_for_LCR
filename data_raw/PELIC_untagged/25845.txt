Eveyn Glennie a percussionist began an to lose her hearing when she was eight years old. By the time she was twelve she was profoundly deaf. Glennie can hear sounds and can tell them apart even though she cannot hear them the way she did long ago. For example she can hear that someone is speaking but cannot hear words clearly so she reads lips to get the meaning. Glennie is a performer and she is able to design and sell her own percussion instrument from unusual materials.
