In spring break my friend and I decided to go on picnic. He did not came over to my home early. I called him but no one answered my call. However I keep calling and I did not give up trying until his wife answered me . She said sorry ANON_NAME_0 just had his breakfast so I told her I will call him back and I hang up the phone . After one hour I called him back . The same thing his wife answered but I did not hear her so I asked her to turn the TV down . After that I could hear the voice clearly. She told please hold on while I take the phone to ANON_NAME_0. ANON_NAME_0 told me that he found out the good way to spend great time. And he asked me to pick up his children from the school . I went to the school . The principal asked me to sign up and fill out form and I did. And I went over his home and we went on picnic .
