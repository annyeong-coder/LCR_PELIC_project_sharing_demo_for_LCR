I am kinda person believe that in the life everything happens for some reasons everything ends for some reasons. What happened in the past happened in the past. Feeling regretful about something can't help anyone to tun back the time. It only works for one thing to learn a lesson. If a bad thing happens in my life I think and tell my self if that one wouldn't have happened another bad thing could have happened. And another bad thing could have been more worse for me and could have made me more upset. So I learn lessons from the bad things to turn them to be useful in the future for me. Ofcourse I tell my self 'Aysegul you shouldn't have done that you might have said this you could have acted like this'. But for some reason. . For to learn lesson not to repeat the same mistakes again. Because the things I felt regretful aboout teach me the correct. Thus I don't repeat the things that I shouldn't have done before. If I repeat the same mistake it shows me that I haven't learned lesson from my first mistake yet. Acting more carefully and more thinking before acting make our lifes more easier. Optimism helps people not pessimism.
