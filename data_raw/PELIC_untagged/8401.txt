Two heads are better than one. I agree with this expression. Sometimes I have a little trouble in my life but I can not solve problems by myself so I need other people's help. I often talked with my husband about some problems of my work before because I wasn't able to settle how to do when I met with the difficult thing. He always told me his ideas as an outsider. For example One day I formed a travel plan for our company but I couldn't complete it until finishing time so I had to take them home with me and continue it. My husband just took a look at the plan while I was doing it then he showed me a more simple way to make it better. His advice was very important for me in such a case. These experiences let me know that two heads are better than one.
