I won't study next week. I'll have a lot of time to relax. I'll stay home. Then I'll invite my classmates to go out. I'm going to do stuff such as rent movies watch T. V clean up my room and wash my laundry. But I won't forget to do my homework on weekkends. Maybe I'll visit some interesting places in Pittsburgh. I think that next week is going to be an awsome vacation !
