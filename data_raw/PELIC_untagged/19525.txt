There are several differences between the past and present. When I was young I used to walk to school but now I take my car . I used to live in Small town but now became a city. In my country home used to very simple but now there are pretty houses and villas and skyscrapers. In my country we used to eat Healthy food but now Many people are eating Fast Food. I didn't use to play game but I do now.
