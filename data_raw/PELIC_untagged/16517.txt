My last weekend is very boring. First of all I have a lot of housework to do and I spent much time to do it. For example I did the laundry and cleaned kitchen. Moreover I do not go anywhere. I just stayed at my apartment and did something the same. Such as watched television read story book and listened to music. Finally I have a lot of homework to do and I have to study for test. I studied core vocabularies for reading test and prepared my speech for speaking test. I hope that my next weekend will be more fun.
