ELI classrooms have some problems that have to be built them up. First one is some tools are broken down in the classrooms. For example because a blinds in my classroom is broken the people who take the room care put it away. And they didn't make it up yet so the sunshine annoy us especially in the morning. Due to that I appeal to that they set it about during the spring break. Next problem is that the atmosphere of our classrooms are boring. If you look over all of the ELI classrooms you can turn it out that all classroom is almost same and that brings the boring out. You know ELI has many students of diverse nationalities. Consequently I think that the classrooms should take them after. So it is necessary that put international stuffes on the wall of classrooms. I'm sure that the classrooms end in a perfect place to study if the people who take the classrooms care carry my idea out.
