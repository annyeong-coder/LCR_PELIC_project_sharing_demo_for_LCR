Parents sometimes manipulate their children to choose a major or career. They don't know that by doing this they might prevent him from doing what he loves. That what happened with ANON_NAME_0 when he told his parents he want to be a singer. They made him transform his mind and study dancing even when he told them he does not like it. Actually He could has been one of the best singers in the world if he continued singing. He is one of few people that can fluctuate their voice tones. I hope that the time can go back and ANON_NAME_0 parents do not try to persuade him.
