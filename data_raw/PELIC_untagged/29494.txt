This speech has four parts. First Mr. Rosling talked about family size and life expectancy between industrialized countries and developing countries. Industrialized countries have smaller families and people have longer lives. Developing countries have larger families and people have shorter lives. Many countries were changing from developing to industrialized countries from 1962 to 2003 according to the statistical records. Second he indicated child survival rate and wealth issues in different countries. He showed 20 of people in the world possess the 74 of money and the child survival rate almost based on the money they earned. In these decades South Korea improved its child survival rate and GDP capita remarkably and China got out of poverty obviously. With this information we can't use them same strategies to solve problems in different countries with different situations. Then he talked about the importance of database. We should get them free and searchable. Moreover we need to make them into the graphic formats. Then we can understand the information instantly. P. S. Very sorry about hand in late I thought the due time was 9pm it's totally my mistake
