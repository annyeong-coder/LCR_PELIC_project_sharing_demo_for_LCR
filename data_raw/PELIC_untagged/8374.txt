An important environmental issue in my country is a landfill. Even though my country Korea is small there are a lot of people. We have a Kim po landfill and a Dang ANON_NAME_0 landfill to bury in trash. However these days it is a big problem in my country because we do not have enough an area to bury a trash. The Jo Sun which is a Korean newspaper predicted that The Korean landfill is going to disappear after 30 years later. Korean government has been aware of this problem so they announced several solutions. First of all the government is going to make new landfill. Second The government is going to export trash to China.
