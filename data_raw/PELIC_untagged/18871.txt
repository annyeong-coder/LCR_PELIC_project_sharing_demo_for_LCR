During the last summer vacation I went on a trip to D. C. By myself because I wanted to learn more about American culture. When I arrived in D. C. I started to walk. While I was walking on the street I saw a lot of homeless people living in the streets and parks. I decided to ask about the reason why they live in the street. I saw a man who slept and woke up on the bench in the park. I talked with him for a while. He said that he used to work for a company but the company went bankrupt and his boss made away with his money. I felt so sad about him but there was nothing I could to do. So I tried to think about things I could do. I gave him a treat for a dinner and encouraged him by telling that there are still so many jobs in the city. Like him some homeless people are afraid to have a job. Not only the U. S. Government but also we need to know about the seriousness of homeless people and we have to let them know jobs they can do.
