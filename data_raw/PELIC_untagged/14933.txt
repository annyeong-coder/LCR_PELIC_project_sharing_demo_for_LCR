There are many events in my life. First of all I was born in Benigazi Libya. I have lived in Benigazi for fifteen years. Then I moved with my family to Misrata Libya. I have lived in Misrata since 1992. After that I got married in 2001. My husband was from Tripoli so I moved with him to Tripoli. Next we had the first child after one year. When my son was two years old I have traveled to Egypt. In Egypt I have visited the pyramids. Also Egypt has a huge library in Alexandria I have visited it too. Actually I have visited Egypt two times. At the first time I didn't go to see the pyramids however the second time I have tried to see them and other places in Egypt. In addition I have studied graduate school for three years. After I got masters degree I had the second child for me. Next I have taught Chemistry for three years. I think I acquired a necessary experience of teaching Chemistry. Recently my government decided to send me for studying out my country and it gave me scholarship. I chose the U. S. A to get the ph. D from one of its universities. I had traveled to Tunisia before I traveled to the U. S. A. I went to Tunisia because I have to get the visa of the U. S. A from there. Now I am living in the U. S. I have been here for eight months. Last September I had the third child for me. Those were important events in my life. The most exciting thing in my life was every child I had was born in period of time relevant to aspect of my studying.
