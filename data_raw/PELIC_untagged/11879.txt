I will write about not an interesting but a bad experience I've had with money. More than 10 years ago I was living in Germany. When I went to Heiderberg that was very popular area for Japanese at that time I bought a few of postcards in a small souvenir shop. The amount was 2 Marks Mark was a denomination in Germany before Euro . So I gave a merchant a paper money of 10 Marks and waited for changes 8 Marks. However he gave me just only 8 Pfennig! Pfennig was also a denomination in Germany before Euro . Pfennig was one hundredths of Mark. I was very shocked because I recognized that I was cheated by him. I felt like crying but I protested him in German. When I complained of something my German was almost perfect owing to necessity. He was very surprised at my German protestation and then he gave me 8 Marks as soon as possible instead of 8 Pfennig I gave him back. He told me It's my careless mistake. But I could not believe him. Dose a merchant make such a mistake on earth There was a great difference between 1 Mark and 1 Pfennig the size and the color. I thought a lot of tourist from Japan had been cheated by him without knowing. This is my worst experience in Germany through for 4 years. Though I was also sometimes discriminated in Germany I did not care so much because it's common in European countries. I loved Germany and German people but the merchant crushed my confidence to his country into the ground by a mere little money. The problem was not the amount. Remarks 1 Mark c. A. Yen 60 80 at that time 1 Mark about a half dollar
