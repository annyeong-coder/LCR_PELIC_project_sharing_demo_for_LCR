Last weekend I saw Coco Before Chanel a movie starring Audrey Tautou as Coco the founder of the famous fashion brand Chanel the movie showing Coco life before she becomes a famous designer. At the beginning of the movie we see the orphanage in which coco has spent her childhood. Then through the movie we can notice how living in an orphanage where nuns and girls mostly wear simple black and white dresses has a huge affect on her taste and style. How she tends to the simplicity in clothes in the time which women like to wear clothes with a lot colors and feathers in order to show their wealth. Finally Coco Before Chanel is a movie worth watching since it depicts the story of icon woman who have a great impact on fashion until today.
