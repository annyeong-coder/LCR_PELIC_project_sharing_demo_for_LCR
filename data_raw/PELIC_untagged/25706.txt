How study about English in Korea and how study about English in the U. S. Are really different. Actually studying English in Korea is more difficult to improve most aspect of English. However in Korea I can acquire the PHILOSOPHY of grammar with ease because a system to learn about grammar is very excellent. Also a reading system about English is good too. Nonetheless other aspect ot studying English are not exactly good. Although the systems which are about reading and grammar are very special I couldn't improve my skill of English. A studying in the U. S. Is more useful to me to learn English because I can learn UNDERLYING point about English and I have to use English. As a result I think studying in the U. S. Is more helpful to my English.
