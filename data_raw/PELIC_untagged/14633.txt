For children who born in the USA the procedure for getting new passports is easy. Today ANON_NAME_0 and I went to apply for a US passports for our new babies. And I think this experience must help me writing my HW. The process as following First of all Parents must choose the type of passport they want for their child card book . Then they have to fill in the application form. They do not have to have pictures for the baby because the clerk is going to help them to do so. The parents must agree that the whole information provided in the application is correct and at the same time they have to bring out their IDs. The only one supporting document must be submitted with the application is the baby's certificate of birth. Finally They have to pay the fees which goes into two parts. 60 Must be paid to the US of state. This amount of money must not be paid in cash because the US department of state accepts only personal checks and money order. The second part of the fees is 40. The parents have to pay it as a post office service fees.
