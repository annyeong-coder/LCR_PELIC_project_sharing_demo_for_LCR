Does the best friend who you love much more than the others have to be exactly like you I do not agree with that. My best friend who is different from me has been my best friend since ten years. She has a different personality which I like about her. Also her style which makes her different than my other friends is completely different from mine but I believe that we make a good picture beside each other. Even though she is not the same like me in many ways she has other sides in common with me that make our relationship go far. The differences that we have and the similarities we share which I enjoy and prefer to have in my relationships have made our times more fun and more useful as well. Actually each one of us respects these personalities and characters that we have which has made our friendship stronger. She is my closest friend who I can talk to about any thing. She is the only friend who I am afraid to lose one day.
