Hearing the news about the protest in Tunisia I found it funny. By no means could I take it seriously. Later when Egyptians started to rebel I realized it was more complicated than I thought. I stared to rethink the situation in my country anticipating what would happen next. Indeed it was with great relief that I came to discover the truth that Saudi people are more than satisfied with their government. Being very fair generous and wit King Abdu Allah is loved by all. Thrilled by the moment I yelled God bless you dear King. Because we Saudis are fully given our rights as citizens we do obey and respect our government.
