My brother is a completely sport person. He is interested in many kinds of sports especially in baseball and basketball. For instance he not only loves to play baseball and basketball but also he is familiar with the rules. As a fan of these two kinds of sports he can memorize all the records of the players or teams which he is interested in. Also he can analyze the strategies which the teams use during the game. He always explains it very well and I think his analysis is the reason why I can understand baseball. I have to say I am not so interested in basketball. Moreover He is always extremely enthusiastic and excited about the games. I believe the enthusiasm of him also influences my family a lot. Now all the members of my family are sports fans!
