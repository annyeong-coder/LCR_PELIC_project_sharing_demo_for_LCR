Five months ago I went to Miami with my husband and friend. We were on short vacation we couldn't spend much time. We went for only one week. We went by airplane the airplane company was Jet Blue. We arrived in the airport and we went to the city. I took with my lap top and my equipment end a camera to take a lot of pictures. I saw a monument for I can't remember the name of that person and we visited the downtown and many beaches. We were in the hotel but in there was a few people and enough of food. We enjoyed the short vacation and I hope going there again and have more fun.
