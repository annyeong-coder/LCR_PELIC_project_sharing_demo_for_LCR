The effects of climate on my lifestyle I moved to Pittsburgh from my home town Nagoya in Japan 4 years ago. On the first year I was shocked by climate differences. Pittsburgh has short springs nice summers no falls and long icy winters. Nagoya has nice springs hot and humid summers warm falls and windy winters. I am getting use to climate here and adjusted my lifestyle to here. I think there are three main effects of climate on my lifestyle clothes hobbies and bath. First I have kept both my winter coats and spring coats in my closet a year round since the weather in Pittsburgh is sometimes drastically changed. For instance I had a very hot summer day and then the temperature dropped around 32 F next day. I need a cart even beginning of summer. Japan has very distinguish four seasons so that I used change my clothes in my closet twice a year after summer and after winter. On the other hand I do not change my clothes in Pittsburgh. Second my hobbies were increased. Because of summer in Pittsburgh is quite comfortable comparing with Nagoya I feel like doing exercise outside during summer. And also winter in Pittsburgh is obviously long I needed to find something to do inside during winter. For example when I was a child I liked to play tennis outside but once I grew up I stopped to play tennis especially during summer due to high humidity of Japan. Now I like to play tennis even during summer here. In addition I did neither knit sweaters nor saw dresses since it takes time for me when I was in Japan. Amazingly I added both of them to my hobbies after I came here. The number of my hobbies are double compared with its when I was in Japan. The last I used take a bath every day when I was in Japan but now I take a shower every day even I have a bathtub at home. I use it only a couple of times during winter. Because of the humidil In conclusion I changed my lifestyle clothes hobbies and bath.
