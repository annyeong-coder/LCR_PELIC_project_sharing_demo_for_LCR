I think global warming is one of the most important problem for us. Abnormal weather require us to act immediately. We need to reduce greenhouse effect gas as possible as we can. We have to think about reducing wasteful spending. We can improve our life from small things. I always got plastic bag when I went to a supermarket and I throw away after use. But I decide to bring shopping bag from now. I also recommend walking or using bus when you don't have to use your car. Walking is good for both earth environment and your health. Of course also all companies must keep trying to reduce the gas.
