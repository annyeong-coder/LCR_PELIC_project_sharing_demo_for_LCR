In my opinion I think practicing a sport for several hours a day isn't a good. First of all practicing a sport for several hours a day is making over loud on function of respiratory circulation systems that's require too much oxygen to supply the vital organs. Second anyone has practicing a sport for several hours a day become exhausted. Also he has fatigue and need long time for sleeping. Finally practicing a sport every other day for one or two hours is enough to keep fit. This way conserves in good shape and earns outcomes satisfactory.
