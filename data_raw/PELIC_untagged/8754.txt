Last yesterday I worked late and it was raining. I wanted to go home but I decided to walk home because usually the bus comes not frequently at that time. When I saw the bus stop I wish the bus had come quickly but there was just one person who waited for the bus so I left. I thought what if the bus comes and I would miss it. After I left I could see the bus going with many empty seats. If only I had waited for a few minutes I would have gone home earlier and I wouldn't have gotten a cold.
