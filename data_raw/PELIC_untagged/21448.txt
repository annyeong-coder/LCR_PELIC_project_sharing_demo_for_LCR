If I could go to a desert Island for five weeks I should take matches with me. I think matches are the right choice because with it I can make a fire which I can cook on. Also I have to take a knife which I can use to cut branches fruits and may use it in defending against the wild animals. Another choice I had better take a book with me so I can read when I feel bored also. I must choose an interesting and very long book. Any way I believe if I have the choice of going to this island I may not go there.
