I just moved to my place I would like to stay here before go back home my country I have been looking into fen shui style is pretty interesting. My parents always turn my bed around to renew energy I did the same just few days ago here. Last night when I was talking with my sister on the phone she thought back on me and my trouble with cough and told me hold on before you go sleep try lemon out for your cold and move your bed around from the window . She said that because she wants to talk me into care about myself from the cold weather in Pittsburgh. I would like to fix my wall up with butterflies as well as my mirror I want my roommate hang it up for me after I clean it up this weekend Saturday I must throw away the garbage the truck comes to pick it up only that day. About the floor I'm going to put wood that is expensive therefore I have to keep on saving money and calling back to language researchers to earn at least few dollars. In general my space makes me happy moreover the windows let the light in and I was thinking over if take the curtains down to can see the sun every morning and fall for Rafa Nadal seeing the sunset every afternoon but it will be very cold at night so I have to find information out about how fen shui could keep my room warm and avoid bring me down in the cold weather.
