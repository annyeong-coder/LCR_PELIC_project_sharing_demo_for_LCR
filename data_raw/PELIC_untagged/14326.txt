My favorite food is the stuffed turkey that my mother prepared for Christmas dinner. The stuffed turkey has a big size because there are fifteen member of my family the stuffed turkey has an orange color it has a strong smell and a salty taste. We together eat around the table the delicious food that mother prepare for us. At same time the stuffed turkey is served with a delicious red wine. The red wine has a fresh smell and a fruity taste. We finish the turkey with the red wine next open the gifts that Santa Claus has left for us in Christmas night.
