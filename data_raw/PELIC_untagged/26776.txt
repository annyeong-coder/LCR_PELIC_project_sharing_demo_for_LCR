An Important Relationship I met my best friend when I participated in a Summer Medical Camp. People were standing in a line and waiting for registration and she was in front of me. We introduced ourselves to each other. After the introduction we were chatting away like old friends. One year later we admitted to the same university. Simultaneously there was a surprising thing when I moved into the dorm. While I was tidying up the room she came in and said Hi I am your roommate. What a coincidence!
