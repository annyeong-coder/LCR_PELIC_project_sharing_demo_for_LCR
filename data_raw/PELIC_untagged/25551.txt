I think Birth order is related with personality because birth order might affect people's personality. Especially in my country most family usually have two children and parents think they have different personality which is more better than other child or worse than other. It is crucial fact for children and their parents to bring up them. For example 1st child usually have trust from their parents and more reliable or dependable than 2nd child. I think it is kind of inherent personality because parents have expectancy to 1st child. However 2st child is not reliable because I think parents don't expect many things to 2st child. In addition parents like 2st child more than 1st child. Also if an child is alone without brother or sister child's personality will be more spoiled or stubborn to do anythings. Sometimes Korean think that the child who is only one in the family is rude to talk or to be with child. Therefore I believe that the birth order or being an only child is related child's personality.
