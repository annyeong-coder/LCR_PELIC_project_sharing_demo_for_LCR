My favorite hobby is cooking a dish. Let me introduce how to cook my favorite dish bulgogi. Bulgogi is food marinated with soy sauce and other spices. It is easy to make. First mix pear juice sesame oil sesame seeds soy sauce sugar and minced garlic. Then put sirloin steaks in the bowl and marinate sirloin steaks for 5hours in the sauce that you made. Finally take out of steaks in the bowl and put the bulgogi on the electric grill. Bulgogi is a delicious dish.
