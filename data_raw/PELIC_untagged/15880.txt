My family is very big. I have six brothers and three sisters. My father is consul and my mother is a teacher. I think the most interesting person in my family is my mother. My mother has short gray and curly hair. She has green eyes that show many emotions. She is short and plump. She has white skin and a dimple on her face. She wears glasses. She wears a gold ring and a gold necklace. My mother has an interesting life. My mather born in small town. She married at young age. Sixteen years when she was married. My mother sometimes talks about those times but not all things. Some things that keeps me. I love my mother and I love talking with her. Her life is very fun but sometimes it was very difficult.
