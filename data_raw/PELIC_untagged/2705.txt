Some people are probably more successful in their relationship they have the qualities essential to loving relationships. The lack of these qualities is probably the cause of many problems we have with other people but many of us would benefit form developing those qualities we don't have. For example many people get married and divored over and over again and others don't get along with coworkers on the job. Perhaps their lives would be easier if they were at communication or if they were more honest about their feelings.
