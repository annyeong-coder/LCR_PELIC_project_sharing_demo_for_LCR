When I was 13 years old I went to Europe. Before I went to Europe I thought that Europe would be clean and beautiful. I thought that Europe would be as same as the photos in the books and weather would be always clear and sunny. But my expectations were not true. The streets were dirty and weather was not good. It was rainy or cloudy almost all day. The subway station in France smelled bad. Everything I have seen was not beautiful.
