I remembered when I got my driver's license that had been long and hard. I started it in December 2006 on the 4th of this month and I got my license on the 21st of April. The first time that I drove was with my father he had taken me into a empty parking and I started to drive around turning off the car a lot of times. After that I started the lessons for the writing test. I had been attending at this lessons for 3 months and finally on March the 16th I passed the exam with 0 mistake. Than I started the driving lessons and I had been practicing for 1 month. That was easy for me because my mum let me drive her car every times. The only problem was that I couldn't drive alone I need every times someone sit beside me. Now by October 2007 I had been driving alone for 6 months.
