If God gave me a chance to live where I want to live in I would prefer to live in my hometown rather than the city I live in now. When I had lived in my hometown Seoul Korea before I moved in Pittsburgh the U. S I wanted to live in somewhere which is beautiful nature environment good neighborhood and better educational environment. As these aspects Pittsburgh is one of the greatest places where I want to live in. Nevertheless I still miss my hometown Seoul a lot. Though people have diverse thoughts about where they want to live in I would prefer to live in my hometown Seoul. There are some reasons why I want to live in Seoul. First of all there are some similarities and differences between Seoul and Pittsburgh at the aspect of natural environment. They have four seasons such as spring the blooming season summer vacation's season fall beautiful autumnal tints and winter snow's season. Moreover there are beautiful hills trees grasses and rivers. On the other hand Pittsburgh's winter is longer much cold and snow than Seoul's. It is difficult for me to stand this Pittsburgh's winter. And Pittsburgh's fall is shorter and less beautiful autumnal tints than Seoul's. On this reason I cannot enjoy these beautiful autumnal tints myself to the full. Furthermore Pittsburgh's summer is longer because of the summer time system and sunshine is stronger than Seoul's. I have to pay careful attention to my skin because of this strong sunshine. Due to these differences I would like to live in Seoul.
