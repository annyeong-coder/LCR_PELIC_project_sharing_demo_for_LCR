The story is about Koko a female gorilla who has been adopted and taught American Sign Language ASL by Penny Patterson. In order to make Koko interact with people by ASL Koko has been taken many lessons about how to express it's feeling whether it is hungry thirsty sad happy and sleepy emotionally and physically. For example Patterson brought a kitten for Koko as it asked cause it likes the kitten so much. Then when the kitten died koko started to sign that it depressed and cried whole the time till it forgot about the kitten. Additionally koko plays and makes fun by using ASL with Patterson and also it asks and answer any question. Ultimately Patterson opened a Gorilla's Foundation University up on one of the mountains provided the gorillas a language. Basically it is based on love and respect. Koko transferred to the university with a new gorilla as a partner called Mike and they picked up more than 20 signs within 3 years. Briefly koko now is performing better and living a nice life with Patterson.
