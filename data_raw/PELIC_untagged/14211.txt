My best friend is Yik which have a Chinese meaning the sun. He is a Thai student whose physical appearance is different from mine. He who is well built has tanned skin. In addition he sometimes tells a joke which he has made up. His funny stories always cheer other people up which makes others love him. He also can make a speech in public which is one of his communication skills.
