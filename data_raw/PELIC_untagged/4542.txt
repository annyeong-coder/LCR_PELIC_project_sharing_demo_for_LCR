ANON_NAME_0 would be a good roomate for me because he have several characterics. Firstly this guy is calm and quiet though I do not care too much about noise maker. Quieter always means better. Secondly he does clean his room routinely. I believe that everyone should clean his own place and so as guys. Thirdly the weekend and casual activity is dinking some sake the finest Japanese rice wine by which I can say that it will make ANON_NAME_0 the most welcome person in guy's dormitory. Ultimately he came from Japan where is clean and beautiful and I am interested in. Thus we may possibile have common conversational issues to chat in which we could know each other well. Accordingly I can said that ANON_NAME_0 could be a good roommate for me.
