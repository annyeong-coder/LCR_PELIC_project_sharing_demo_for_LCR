A lot of people wish to travel somewhere out of their home countries for pleasure business or study. I am one of the people who like electronics and motorcycles which makes me really want to visit Japan the origin of Sony Toshiba Panasonic Yamaha Honda and many more great companies. There is something about Japanese people I really appreciate which is their dedication to work discipline and punctuality besides their ancient civilization including the Samurai culture. I really crave to see how they make things done and the methods they follow to have the discipline and innovation. Once I watched a report about the differences between Japanese workers and their American peers which was caught on surveillance cameras the Japanese workers kept doing work until they were done even it passed regular business hours but for the American we were able to see the employee stretching and moving his arms and legs preparing to leave an hour before the business hours end. I don't think that the American one is lazy but I really think that the Japanese have something makes them special and more work loving than any other civilizations. One day I will go there and eyewitness the course they follow and the beliefs they have in order to keep coming up with these great inventions for the sake of the human kind.
