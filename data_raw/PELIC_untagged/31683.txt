The Desert Island Next summer I will go with my friends to a Desert Island. We must take some equipment to survive. First we have to take a knife to cut off the trees and the food such as meat chicken and fruits. Second we should take a pistol for protection and hunting. Third we have to bring a lighter and matches to be able to cook and set on fire. In conclusion we must take all this equipment to be able to survive and come back safely to our homes .
