The town where I grew up was a small satellite city. I liked my hometown where a lot of natures still had. I could hear croaking of bullfrogs and crowing of chickens. I remember several New Year's mornings when I climbed a nearby mountain to see the first sunrise. It was so cold and climbing was hard but I enjoyed it. In addition I remember one summer when I went down a river in a boat. It was exciting because of a fast flowing. However the view where I saw from the boat was very beautiful.
