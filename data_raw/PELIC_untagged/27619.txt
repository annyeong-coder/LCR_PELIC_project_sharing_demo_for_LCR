I want to change a lot of things in our grammar classroom. First I would like to hang up an educational posts on the wall. Also straighten the tables up. Second I would like to figure out a way to include a smart board in the class. But I would keep on the window's curtains. Finally I think the grammar classroom would turn out to be a better classroom with these changes.
