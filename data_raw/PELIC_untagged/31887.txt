It is likely to die when I stop using electronic devices. In fact nowadays It is difficult to refuse student from using digital electric such as Cell phone Laptop or digital toy . So you will find some students use electronic devices even in class. From my point of view these devices might help students to improve their language. So I do not agree to restrict student from using electronic devices. Therefore I will find most difficult to do something without using Cell phone.
