A friend in need is a friend indeed I agree that friend is someone who helps you and is there for you. I have a best friend who lives in South Korea. I met him in high school and we used to play soccer together. He has been always there for me. When my mother passed away he was the one who helped me the most. I did the same thing back to him when his parents died. A few years ago my leg was broken and my best friend who drove me to work every single day until my leg got better which is a very nice and hard thing to do because most people get lazy. He is someone who I could trust and have fun with. He is someone whose personality is so differrent from mine but we still connect. I am glad that I have a friend who is so wonderful.
