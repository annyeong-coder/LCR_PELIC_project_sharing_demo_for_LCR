My room which is small is very comfortable. There is a window that you can see sun at opposite to door. A mattress that makes me relax is against the wall. A bookcase where next to mattress is at the corner. A clothes chest which is full of clothes is small but I like my clothes chest. Dave who is one of my roommates lends me air conditioner which is the best item in summer. But I don't like my chair which is uncomfortable. I want to change my chair as soon as possible.
