I think our grammar class is very funny. What always makes me laugh is ANON_NAME_0 and Mement. One day ANON_NAME_0 was talking with Mement. She said I wonder whether you are pregant. Menent said Why you have such a stupid idea ANON_NAME_0 said That you have fat on your belly is the reason. Mement said ok the problem is who is the father of this baby At this time I thought I should say something I believe that ANON_NAME_0 is the father of this baby.
