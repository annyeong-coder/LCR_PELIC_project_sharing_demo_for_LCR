Hello I'm ANON_NAME_0 Last Name . I've been writing this page to introduce myself. I was born in Seoul Korea and I grew up there until last year. Now I'm living in Pittsburgh and studying English. I've liked reading books since I was a child. Now I've been reading 'Twilight' series in English and it's really funny but somewhat difficult for me to read. Since I've been deeply affected by the teachers when I was student I want to be a teacher. So now my major is Korean language education and I'm planning to be a teacher.
