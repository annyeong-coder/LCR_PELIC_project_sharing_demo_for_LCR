Writing My weekend During the weekend there are several activity that I really enjoy to do and fortunately I could do everything during the last week end. First off all I could sleep longer Saturday and Sunday I got up after 9 am is the best way to start a new day. Secondly I love take time to have a long breakfast during the week is impossible every time I have to check the clock and pay attention don't be late. After an abound breakfast Saturday morning I phoned my parents in Italy and I spent more then 2 hours telling about my week and some recently news. Was a long called but during the week my busy scheduling and the different time zone don't give me too many chances to phone in my country. When I left my computer I could not believe that it was 3 pm! The day was going off but I anything was done! I started immediately some quickly activity like red up my room wash myself and some clothes and fortunately before dinner I found some time that I spent on my school book. Saturday night I didn't do any thing particularly exciting I watched one movie with my aunt and I read some book of course everything in English! Sunday when I got up my first thought was studying unfortunately at school the teachers give a lot of homework and during the weekend I have to found a couple of hours. I finished my homework only at 4 pm I was exhausted only a big dish of pasta could help me. My weekend finished with a nice dinner that I really enjoyed it. I'm leaving far then my country and during the weekend I like call prepare some Italian food or read some news about what happen in my country and this weekend I did all this things now I'm ready to start another week.
