There are many ways to cook tomatoes but there is one way I like best. The type I like is called Iraqi fried tomatoes. First you need to wash the tomatoes and you cut them in slices. Then you pour oil into a frying pan and heat it for two minutes. After that you put the tomato slices into the hot oil you leave it frying for 20 minutes. Next you get the pepper and the salt and shake them on the tomatoes. After that you wait another ten minutes so basically you will have 30 minutes of frying the tomatoes. This way of frying tomatoes is the best way for me because it tastes delicious and it is easy to make. You should try it .
