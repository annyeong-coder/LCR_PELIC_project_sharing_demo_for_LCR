Topic 1 To choose an excellent book doesn't guarantee an outstanding movie. Books in general trends to entertain leading you to enter into a world of imagination. When you read a book you mind is being bombarding for a plenty of ideas and scenarios. It's as you were living a parallel history. On the contrary a movie tells you the history but also show you the scenarios the landscapes and let you a little for imagination. I have read many books which are been taken to the cine. Dan Brown's books The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demonds are examples of them. While I was reading this books my mind was obligated to imagine how the characters looks like and also to give a scenario where the scenes were happening. Books frequently sustain you in a state of attention where sometimes are unable to stop. Also books increment your vocabulary and enhance your concentration ability. On the other hand when I saw the same book's story in the screen I felt they were telling me the story in a hurry way. Actually I did need to use the background knowledge that I had about the story in order to understand what movie's characters mean. Sometimes book based movies could be biased by a director or producer's point of view. It is not uncommon a director change the direction of the story or give it an ambiguous final. It is specialty true when controversial topics are being told like religion and politics. For instance in the Da Vinci Code film I suspect Ron Howard received many pressures to don't reveal all of the polemic issues that the book disclosed. So taking in count the above book may exhibit more details. For these reasons I prefer to read the book before coming to see a book based film. This process may reveal me more information and also stimulate my imagination. On the contrary films might have more specials effects and proportionate entertain but also could be biased by a third point of view.
