Compare my definition of success with my husband 1 29 2007 ANON_NAME_0 Definition of success is referred to accomplish one's goal or to get high position and financial resources. However I think that the word success would be indefinable. To get high position and financial resources that are general conception is merely a process. I always suffer that I have an experience of success or not when someone ask me about experiences of success. People who surround me would say that you have an experience of success such as passing the exam of college and getting a qualification of a nurse. Those experiences are only process for me to spend to enjoy my life. If I had an opportunity I think that my life was success it could be my dying day. In general one of the occupation in successful is doctor. My husband is one of them. Therefore I thought to compare my definition of success and my husband's one. My husband always set a target and achieves a target again and again. If I though I got a success I wouldn't find authentic success. If I thought I wouldn't get a success I would get nothing he said. In fact he keeps expending efforts after he was a doctor. That is to say he is one of same opinion with me. To accomplish one's goal might be one of successes because these small successes would lead bigger success. We sometime might feel that someone is success person however they mightn't feel to get a success. In conclusion I think that others wouldn't decide that someone is success person or not. I only could find an answer whether I got a success. In other word the word success is indefinable.
