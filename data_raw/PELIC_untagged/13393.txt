I am going to talk about my favorite meal. Three months ago I went to a restaurant for my girlfriend's birthday. The name of the restaurant is Ruth . It is located downtown. When I visited there we ordered an appetizer a grilled steak and a dessert. The appetizer was made of shellfish. It was very delicious because I love sea food. The grilled steak was delicious too. Finally the dessert was fantastic. A chef decorated the dessert so it looked like a piece of art. I ate the dessert with tea. Although the restaurant was expensive I was amply satisfied with their food. For this food I made a good ceremony with my girlfriend so if I have enough money I hope to go there again.
