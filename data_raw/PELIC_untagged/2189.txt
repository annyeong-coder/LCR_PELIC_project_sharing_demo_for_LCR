It is comfortable for me especially My writing tools must be neat on the desk So I can easily do something without mess and I like to write in the quiet evening with bright light and warm temperature It is good for me . My simple night suit keeps me relaxed when I write at home . Then I make a cup of my favorite drink Such as bitter tea or green tea or orange juice . I also like to eat something when I write . For example I have fresh fruits orange apple grapes . I usually use a pencil pen notebook dictionary and some papers for my writing tools .
