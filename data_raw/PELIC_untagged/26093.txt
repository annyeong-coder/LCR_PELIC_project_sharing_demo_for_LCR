I don't agree with the insist that her mother is limited by her imperfect English. This is because she can listen to other people's speaking and read complicate and sophiscated magazines and books like Forbes even though her English especially speaking is not impeccable. She has some obstacles to express her opinion and intend in her ordinary life and is ignored by people. However the obstacles doesn't mean that she cannot do what she want to do. On the contrary she can understand people and situation and also found useful alternatives to overcome them. As the story says she achieved the most of things she want to do even though the methods she used was not ordinary to native speakers. For example she let her daughter pretend to be herself.
