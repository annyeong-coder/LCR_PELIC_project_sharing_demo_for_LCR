My dream for a long time is to study abroad. Once I got my job I started to make my dream come true. It's a great chance to study English and Master degree in the States where is the experts are in my field of linguistics. Also the States is where a new culture can be known. I started my journey with searching for universities and cities after that I applied to the school I wanted and I completed all the paper work and then I came to Pittsburgh. I started my initial research on the internet. I looked for English schools and applied linguistics programs in the States. I made a long list and I started to assess my choices for the cities and the programs. After that I met with people who studied in the States and asked them about their experience. My list got shorter and shorter and I focused on Pittsburgh. When it comes to Pittsburgh you can not miss University of Pittsburgh! Then I made my decision. After I chose the school that I wanted I contacted a friend in Pittsburgh and he applied for me. I paid the application fees. Once I received the acceptance letter I prepared my scholarship paper. It took time until I completed all the documents that I needed. After that I reached the visa step. I applied for the visa for my wife and me so we had the interview and began waiting. One month later we received the visa and everything started to be real. We prepared ourselves to leave Saudi Arabia. It was not an easy decision to make. I booked tickets to Washington. After we arrived there I submitted my paper to the Saudi Culture Mission and I came to Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh is an amazing place to live . I like the city very much. Here in Pittsburgh you will find friendly people. And Pittsburgh is one from the most liveable cities. There are a lot of universities to study in Pittsburgh. One of the rivers will flow through your veins.
