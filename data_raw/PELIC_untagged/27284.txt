Since the beginning of the century living conditions have highly improved in the Western world. Thus nowadays most people own a car a TV or a heating system in their House. Although these items are essential in the everyday life people should be more conscious in their use of energy. In fact not only oil but also natural gas are non renewable resources and should be preserved. Instead of them people should prefer sustainable energies such as solar or wind energy. Like this our children would have the opportunity to enjoy an unpolluted and healthy world.
