When I was coming to the U. S. Many people asked me a lot of questions and some of them are the same. For example some people asked me when I will go back or for how long I would stay there. Also some people asked me why I had to study in the U. S. . In addition my friends asked me if I was thinking about that for enough time. People not just asked me questions but also gave me some advices like some of my friends noted that I should study the culture before I go. My family told me That I had planed for that and I got it.
