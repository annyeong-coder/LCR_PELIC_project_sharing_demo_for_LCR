Welcome! I'm . I've been living in Pittsburgh since last September. I built this website to introduce my interests to ELI students. I'm interested in taking a photo. I've begun to take a photo since one year ago in Korea. One of my colleagues in my company has introduced me to the delights of taking a photo using a DSLR Digital Single Lens Reflex camera. At first I hesitated to buy that camera because of the high price. But now I've been thinking that the choice was excellent! Although the camera is so heavy wherever I've traveled I haven't forgotten going with the camera. Even if I'm not interested in a camera I have many kinds of a camera such as a digital camera a film camera and so on. I've been thinking each camera had peculiar characteristics. I attached many photos in this website. I want to share my experiences with my ELI buddies. I wish you enjoy these photos.
