If tourism to Saudi Arabia doubled in the next 20 years that would help the country to get an invaluable cut in this industry. In retrospect our economy was based on the oil therefore we did not try to attract tourists. Nowadays the government took a rational decision to improve tourism and started caring about this industry. In fact tourism will be the world's leading industry in couple of years and if we do not start preparing from now we will not be able to benefit from this hidden treasure. I hope Saudi Arabia will be on of the top tourism destinations.
