Cell phones benefit society Cell phones have become recently widespread in the whole world. Twenty years ago there were no cell phones and life was different from now. Major difference happened since then. Before the invention of the cell phone people were communicated by the land lines which is not as useful as cell phones. In comparison to cell phone land line has a wire attached to it which is inconvenient in using it. Moreover you can't take it outside the house like the cell phone. We might need to take phones outside the house for several reasons. For example if you want to meet somebody you have to call him or her. If you are lost also you have to call someone to get help. Also if someone needs you he or she can reach you wherever you are. But the land line sticks at home and you must share it. Cell phones make life easier especially in communication. The most effective feature that cell phones has is texting which makes huge difference in modern life. For example if you are not able to reach the person you want you can just text him or her a message and he or she will reply later. However some people may think that cell phones are not as useful as other people think because they focus on the side effects that cell phones have. For example the diseases that occur from repetitively using cell phones day and night. For example the most widespread diseases nowadays is cancer and a lot of people having the fear to catch it. That's why they get far away from anything that can cause them this disease. However logically speaking if you don't over use a cell phone you are not likely to get the disease and you will preserve your health. As a conclusion cell phones are the most amazing invention until now especially with all the features that they are accompanied with nowadays. But everything with high technology must has its side effects. So we should avoid the things that lead to them.
