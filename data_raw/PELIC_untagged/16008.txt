Recently I saw a movie called Spanglish. This movie talks about a Mexican woman who came to America to get a better live for her and her daughter. I was impressed by the fact that she did not speak English after years living in America. Suddenly she decided to change her job and she was hired for cleaning in a house of an American Family. It is funny that she could not establish a good communication because it was the main cause of many enjoyable situations between her and all the members of the family especially the mother. It was amusing how the actress who played the role of Mexican woman acted so well. She could do all this body language that showed you all her thoughts without saying any word. That she had a strong accent is another interesting part of the movie. I believe it is good to see this movie because it shows how foreign people whose native language is Spanish face many difficulties trying to get the language correctly. Finally she quit the job because she fell in love with the father of the house.
