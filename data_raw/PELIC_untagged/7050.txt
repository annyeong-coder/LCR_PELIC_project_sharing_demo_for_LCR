The person who always telling the truth to friends is generally considered as a good friend. However being honest does not mean that you will have a good relationship with the person who you tell him the truth. Point out the mistakes which made by your fr Most people are not be able to listen to the true when they are in mistakes. Usually they get angry when someone point out their faults even that is a nice comment that comes his friends. For instance we are usually not allowed to ask a question that would challenge the stance of our friends. Even we tell them plitely and nicely. Most people know that friends who are willing to tell them truth are good friends but they refuse to commit and still get angry at the moment. Telling truth to your friends could hurt his pride badly. At this situation the best thing we can do is telling the truth in an inferred way. For example Japanese people never reject other person directly. When we hang out with them they are nice and are educated to say no in an inferred way. Thus we will not fell too much presures when we were informed that we made mistakes. Accordingly I think that people are not able to acacept somenoe's telling the truth when he is in trouble. Because that could make him angry and fell betryaled when he hears his friends point out his faults. Rare people could accept that sittuation. Thus in this situation I think that we should learn Japanese people to inferr our friends mistakes and try not to hurt his pride as well.
