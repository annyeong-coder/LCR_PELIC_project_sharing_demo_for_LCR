To straighten out a problem several people not only one person can get a better idea than a person does. When I was working in a hospital a conference was actually held when we faced a difficult case to be solved. We could usually have a variety of means or solutions for the problem. And then we including physicians could get to the best answer for the problem from many offered solutions. The importance of Two heads are better than one or Four eyes see more than two is what I learned through my own experience.
