I met my husband three years ago in a party. It was an interesting experience because I was discussing with my friend some strange ideas and then he came from no ware and I started asking me questions . Two days later he visited me home and asked me in my parent's presence to go out . After they agreed we start dating then my husband returned to us . We used to call each other and chat online . It was hard but after two month we got engaged. One year later we got married. It was a nice experience to date someone who lives far away abroad but I'm very thankful because I really took the right decision in the right time with the right person.
