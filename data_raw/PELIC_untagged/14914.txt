Today's my partner was ANON_NAME_0. His name ANON_NAME_0 means a key . His father named him but he doesn't like his name. His friends call him ANON_NAME_1 which means a black man. I think his dark skin is one of reasons. He comes from Libya and he has lived in here for almost 5 years. Now he's living with his family in Centre Ave. At Melwood Str. And he has 5 kids. His hobby is playing soccer. When he was young he was usually a boss in a soccer game. His major is geography and he should study English to graduate from Ph. D. After this semester he wants to study English continuously but in order to study here he should get a good score in TOEFL. If he doesn't get more than 525 in TOEFL he will go to Malaysia because Malaysia doesn't require him TOEFL score. I hope he will get a score which he wants.
