Topic Justice Defied Even though prison purpose is to punish Paris Hilton leave you wondering whether Justice far from being blind needs her vision checked. Because of drunk driving she sentenced to 45days but she's released after three days by softhearted. Even she is remanded but to a special medical facility for an unspecified ailment. Genarlow's case tips the scales the other way. In spite of the state legislature amended Georgia's child protection act to reduce the offense to misdemeanor even a judge ordered Genarlow released but he remains in jail. By Paris and Genarlow we want to justice to be blind to privilege but open to mercy it feels at times as if we are only halfway there.
