Welcome to Junmo's website. Hi this is Junmo Last Name . I've written this website to introduce myself to someone who needs me. I started building a website this month and I will finish it in 2 months. I grew up in Incheon South Korea I got married to a gorgeous woman 1 year ago. I met her while I was studying at the library. I thought she was beautiful the first time I saw her. We were only able to date once a month because her home was far from mine but we finally got married last year. Now I've been living with her in Pittsburgh since January 9th 2010. I'm studying English at the English Language Institute at the University of Pittsburgh. I got a master's degree in computer science 4 years ago and I worked for a company as a computer programmer for 4 years. Now I've been preparing to get into Carnegie Mellon University to get a doctor's degree. I wish I could get into Carnegie Mellon University. I like taking pictures. I've been taking a lot of pictures since I bought a new camera. In particular I took a picture on International Fair. You can see the pictures I took there at my website. I've included a lot of pictures on my website.
