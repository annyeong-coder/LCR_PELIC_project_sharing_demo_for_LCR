My Ideas about Writing I have many ideas before I start to write and when I'm stating to write. Some times my family my friends and my classmates ask me what advice can you give me about starting writing or Homework My advice is we need to relax and we need to feel better before we start our homework because if we feel bad we can't think about what we need to do. For example I am not nervous when I start my writing. I take a shower before I start my writing because it makes me more active. I eat some food sweet vegetable and etc. Before I start my writing because when I am hungry I think about food and I do not think about writing. How do I start It is very important for writing. I think before I start writing I should choose the best place. For example when I want to study with my friends and my classmates I go to the library. When my homework is difficult I go to a quiet place. For example I study in the park and it is a beautiful place. When I study alone I study in my room and I am neat when I study because I clean my room and my desk before I study. I use many tools when I study for example I use pen pencil notebook dictionary and computer. I believe that is very important for me.
