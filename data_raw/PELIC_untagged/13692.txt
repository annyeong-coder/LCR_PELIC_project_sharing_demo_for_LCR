When I first got to this country I didn't understand English speaker on the phone. I often couldn't figure out what the person was saying to me. I kept on asking the person to repeat. I had to give up and he was busy. He said to me call back and he hung up the phone when he finished the call with me. Then I called my friend he to me if I want to practice speaking English I should sign up at 3. 00P. M inG16 B. After that I called my brother I needed some help then I saw a now camera I told to him . He said to me pick up when it was heaping . I told to him OK and I hung up the phone.
