I changed my outline. The organization is side by side method now instead of block method I did yesterday. Shenyang My Hometown and Pittsburgh I have been in Pittsburgh the only American city I've ever lived in for about one year. In the past one year a question like 'Do you like Pittsburgh ' is a forever topic between a foreigner and a local whether you met each other down the street or in a party. This is not a thought provoking question. I always answered 'Something's good Something's not I like it. ' Based on my familiarity with this city in a short while. 'Good or not' in fact is the result from my comparing Pittsburgh to another city Shenyang my hometown in China. Although I lived in Shenyang much longer than I did in Pittsburgh unbiased to say I love both cities because they are both similar and different. Both cities are famous at sports in their countries respectively however the sports items are different. As we know Pittsburgh is a sports city with two championships football and hockey. Similar to Pittsburgh Shenyang is a sports city as well. But Shenyang is well known as a soccer and athletic city in China. Like Steelers and Penguins in Pittsburgh The local teams of Shenyang won lots of national championships. Also almost everyone likes football or hockey in Pittsburgh. Citizens dress the team clothes on game day whether they go to the stadium or not which is like a festival. Likewise Not only the local teams are strong but also residents in Shenyang like sports e. G. Even other city's fans appraised Shenyang soccer fans are the most professional ones in China. It is hard to say which city is better on sports. I was a soccer fan when I was in Shenyang while I am a faithful fan of Steelers now. I love both sports cities.
