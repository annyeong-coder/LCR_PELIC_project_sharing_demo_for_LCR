World is developing everyday people now have many high tech devices in daily lives. For example the invention of microwave saves a lot of time in cooking. Although people have many time saving devices in life they still need to work hard for some reasons. For one reason people work for money to buy devices which makes life easier for another people work for inventing new stuffs to upgrade people's lives. Taking my mother as a example she is a working mother who works regularly. Last month she bought a cleaning robot which can sweep floor by himself even when he runs out the battery he can return and charge himself. My mom feels really exciting about this because she doesn't need to clean floor anymore. In the other hand it costs much money than a broom which takes energy to clean. If my mom didn't have a job she would not afford this. I think these devices make life better even people need to work for them.
