New York. New York socialite Donald Trump's house was broken into late Saturday. The crime was reported after Mr. Donald Trump had discovered that the window had been broken and the safe had been opened. All jewelry and cash which are estimated to have value of 30 000 was stolen. However the most mysterious point is that the most favorite wristwatch of Mr. Trump was not taken away. It is still there. However no traces of an intruder's fingerprint or footprint were found anywhere in the crime scene. Mr. Trump's employees and maids were interviewed yesterday. Unfortunately no useful information has been discovered. However they are still being watched carefully. It is said that the robber could be someone who knows this house very well and that this crime must have been planned very carefully. Probably the robber works in this house. Many evidences are given to support this claim. Firstly the house is heavily guarded by security officers and guard dogs but no sign of intruder was reported at night. Moreover although the safe room is always kept under 24 hour surveillance no suspicious activity has been caught in the video. The robber might know the position of cameras very well or he might have done some tricks on the tape. Until now there has been no report that the jewelry was sold to any antique shops or goldsmiths. It is still questioned that why the robber did not take that watch. Could the robber have forgotten the watch Could he have known that Mr. Trump would be very upset if he lost his favorite one Or could it be possible that Mr. Trump himself set this up and claim for the insurance The mystery goes on.
