Oprah Winfrey addressed at Stanford University Commencement in 2008. She gave the students three lessons about feeling failure and finding happiness that she got through her experiments in her speech. First is that feeling is your emotional guidance system. So you have to do work what you feel right. If you feel wrong don't do it when you accomplish your work. Second every failure has a meaning for your success. It will give you the meaning you need in your life. Third to be happy you need to enjoy your present moment. Also you have to consider something beyond yourself. Don't live yourself alone for truly happiness.
