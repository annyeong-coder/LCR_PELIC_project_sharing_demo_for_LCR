I am often eating lunch at Korea Garden. Here is my favorite place to eat lunch in Pittsburgh. I just love this place not only great food but also easy and simple food. I like a place to meet and greet . The restaurant sells Korean food Japanese food and Chinese food but I am always eating Korean food. The restaurant's food is not only delicious but also comparatively cheap. First of all I can meet Korean easily in this place. These are the reasons why I like this restaurant to eat lunch.
