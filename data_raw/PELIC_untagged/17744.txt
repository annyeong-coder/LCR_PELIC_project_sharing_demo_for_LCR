I I'm not sure the trip of the falling water will go on tomorrow F Sure do you need me to pick up you I That's great can you pick up me at 7 o'clock. Hold on I think 8'o clock is better. Because I need to wake up at 7'o clock and look up the way on the google map. F I figure out it's very important. I don't want to get lost again. I find out the GPS is very convenient. Maybe I need to talk into my father to buy one. I Sorry My mother wants me to buy something for her now. I have to go. I will call back you later and we can talk over the detail of the trip. F Ok see you later bye bye
