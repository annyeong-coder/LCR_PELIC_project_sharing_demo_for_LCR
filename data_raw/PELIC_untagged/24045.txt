The best mirror is an old friend means that an old friend is the best friend to consult and to take his opinion. My best friend is ANON_NAME_0. ANON_NAME_0 who is a sophomore in college is older than me by two years. We studied together in high school where we grew up. We grew up in Riyadh which is the capital of Saudi Arabia. ANON_NAME_0 whose father is a pilot has great character. So he is my favorit friend.
