I started to play a ballet when I entered an elementary school. First of all my parents had me played a ballet so I didn't like it. But gradually I liked a ballet because I was satisfied with dancing. I had wanted to give up ballet when I was practicing for a ballet show because I couldn't dance well at that time. However I had a lot of friends all of whom cheered me up. And I heard the person who continues to practice will be a good dancer. That is why I didn't give up and could try my best. I already stopped to play a ballet but my ballet memory will be never forgotten.
