3 months ago I went through the worst experience that I would have ever had. After a very long and demanding day I checked up my cell phone and I found 27 missed calls were coming from my best friends phone number. As I reached the house I immediately called her back. A very shaking voice picked up the phone and greeted me not as usual. She said you did not show up for a long time and you did reply to my e mails what's wrong . I thought for a while and I turned the volume of the phone up to understand her mumbling. I said we were together yesterday did you forget the tasty barbecue and the drinks . Suddenly she cried and I did my best to cheer her up. She said I am in a very miserable situation and I need your help . I said to her that I am her best friend I will help her out and I asked her about her problem. She replied I need 2000 right now! . She added I really count on you . I asked her to hold on as I bring a pen to write down her account number to send her the money online as soon as possible. While I was coming back as fast as I could I felt from the stairs and I broke my leg. I kept screaming and crept to the phone to ask her to help me out. As she was listening to my screams She said to me I give up but I will call 911 to help you and she hanged up the phone. At that moment I realized that I was so easy to be cheated and stolen.
