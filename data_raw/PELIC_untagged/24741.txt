The story took place in Baghdad Iraq. EOD Bomb disposal unit sent bomb disposal robot to disarm bomb in the middle of the city while another unit were trying to secure this area from people. The robot was controlled by Sergeant JT Sanborn then followed by Staff Sergeant Matt ANON_NAME_0 who was the leader of this unit. They found the bomb and decided to demolish it by using another explosive charge so they put a charge on a small cart attached to the robot. However while the robot carried the small cart one wheel of the cart was loose. In turn ANON_NAME_0 suited up in bomb protective gear. He picked the charge up from the small cart and placed on the bomb. Specialist Owen Eldridge saw someone trying to trigger the bomb by using his cell phone but he could not stop that thus the bomb was triggered and killed ANON_NAME_0. Sergeant First Class William James was called to replace ANON_NAME_0 as a leader of the unit. They were called to disarm bomb near the mosque. Instead of sending the robot James suited himself up and then he approached the bomb. He found the bomb and he managed to disarm it however he found out that there was another six bombs wired together and he could disarmed them all. Sanborn his job was to keep James save didn't satisfy with his reckless behavior of James.
