I feel in the ELI classroom is not so bad. I wish they are change the color because the ELI is very old building. I think we should take off the broke share out the class. I think we should hang up some posters. So we should touch up the window. My classroom is bright and sunny. This cheers me up. My classroom is too small but I can't tear down the walls. I think it will look more spacious if I just straighten it up. With just a few small changes I'll end up feeling happier in my classroom. It is worth trying out.
