March 22 2007 Dear Yamen I recently moved into a new house and I wanted to buy a new sofa. The sofa which I saw first cost 596 but I saw another that cost 824 which is more expensive than the one I had seen before. I like the second one more because it is bigger than the first one and because I like the color which is burgundy more than the second one which is red. And the second one is reclining sofa and it has a drop down table but the first one has fewer features than the sofa which I liked such as long wearing padded back and fabric loss pillows. I think that I will go with the second one because I think that it will be more comfortable than the first one. Sincerely
