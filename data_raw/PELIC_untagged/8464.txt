In my opinion synethesia would be interesting. Synethesia 2 more than senses are cross wiring in our brain makes our life more exciting and diversity. People who have rare brain condition are able to develop and create new culture because they can use couple of senses at the same time. They are more sensitive to everything. For example when they listen to the music audio cortex doesn't only respond but visual cortex also react. We would respect them who have synethesia and if we find out what causes synethesia exactly and how can use it our life will become more variety.
