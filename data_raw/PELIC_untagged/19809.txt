When I first came to the U. S I had a difficult time eating food. Although the food in the U. S was very different with the food in my country I should have overcome the situation. So I compared the food in the U. S with the food in my country in order to make fusion food by mixing Korean food and American food. There are three comparisons between Korean food and American food including flavor recipe and ingredients.
