I met Ty while I was living in Pittsburgh. My language school helped me to meet her. At first we talked briefly to organize a suitable day to talk together. Then we had a meeting day and point. I was waiting at the cathedral. We had a friendly conversation and after a short time we make it up again. We had a dinner in Indian Garden when I met with her friends. Then we went to theater. We were laughing at the play while the players performing.
