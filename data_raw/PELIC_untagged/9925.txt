While I live in the U. S. Studying English is a lot of benefits. If I couldn't understand English I can't live here because sometimes I have to spent alone without my husband. I have several experiences about starting to study English such as at the musium on the phone and communicationn with people and aloso I can know American caltures through English. First of all when I went to the musium which was glass exibition with IWAP member I couldn't understand the tour guidance at all.
