My name is Student's First Name . I am 27 years old. And I'm from Saudi Arabia. I like to meet people coming from different countries and cultures and discuss hobbies and interests. I'm interested in automobile and the relevant issues. My favorite hobbies are soccer and table tennis. Now I'm studying at ELI to improve my language. I came to the US and my target is to get my master degree. My application is pending at the University of Pittsburgh and I'm waiting for the final acceptance to start in this coming semester.
