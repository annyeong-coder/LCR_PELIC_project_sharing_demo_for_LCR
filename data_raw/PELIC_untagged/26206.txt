Dear Sand I am really sorry about your situation. First you should contact your boyfriend and ask him frankly about what is going to be with our relationship. If he show that he is not all that interest you have to end up this relation. Also you had better to keep your job. Moreover you should've decided about your relationship before he left. Anyway I am certin that you could think about it seriously before deciding either choices. I highly suggest that you talk with you mother about she would guide you to the right thing probably. In addition you had better visit him and you can then figure out how interested he is in you and then you can make a descison. You ought to choose the best for your life better. Finally I shouldn't told you that I think you had better get rid of this boyfriend since he just said you can VISIT me but I have to tell you honstly my advice. Sorry for making more compicated and I should have been nicer but when it comes to life descicion I have to be honest. Regards
