My friend Fran has a physical disability. He was four years old when he had a sick a medical condition that affects the nervous system. By the age of five he wasn't able to stand and walk he was in the hospital for moths. When he was better and the doctors couldn't do anything for him he came back to his house and after he went to school and he was eighteen years old he decided to study Psychology. But he couldn't go to the University everyday because his parents couldn't drive to the University for their jobs. His parents spoke with a special transport for people with disability and he could go to the University and he studied Psychology. And now while he looks for a job he will want to study the specialty Juridical Psychologist. When he finishes this specialty he will only work in this. I think he'll be able to be an excellent Psychologist and he'll be able to work where he likes because he is very intelligent.
