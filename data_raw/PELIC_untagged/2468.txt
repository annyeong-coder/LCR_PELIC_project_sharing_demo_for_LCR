I 've studded my primary secondary and high school at different cities and for about twelve years so I have been exposed to different cultures it's been nice experience to have friends had different point of view and background . I 've studded my undergraduate study in Riyadh for six years. I've had difficulty to finish that degree but I've learned how the study become easy if I like my major. I've been seen patient in pain since then and I 've learned how the people so fragile and weak no mater what the social level the have .
