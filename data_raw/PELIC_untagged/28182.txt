Most people think that the parents when they get older they should take them to a care center to have a good care and to be with people with their same age. And have a good time and to enjoy staying there. Therefore I think that the parents love to be surrounded by their children and spent the whole time with them. They tried to do everything to raise their children and take care of them. So their children should keep them in their home and to take care of them. Finally the children should take care of their parents not to put them in the care centers or in houses to take care from other people. It's important to thank them for everything they've done for you and to provide them with everything they need.
