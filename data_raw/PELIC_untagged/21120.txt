Even though my experience is not impeccable about studying English because I have been studying English for one year I created special framework to study and speak English. First of all I focus on speak and write grammatically to be my speaking is understood by people whom are speaking with me. Second I try to mimic native speakers' pronunciation to clarify my speaking. In addition I'm enhancing my English by diversity my vocabularies that I'm leaning. Also learning English need a vivid memory to evokes vocabularies and meanings when need them that what I miss but I try to compensate this missing by writing and using many times the new words. Finally in my experience the language and fluency depends on psychological situation for my sometimes I speak fleecily and sometimes I can't speak three sentences continuous It seems I'm burdened and it is the first time I speak English.
