Veranda Resort and Spa Veranda Resort and Spa is a nice place to visit. Veranda Resort and Spa is located in the east part of Thailand. It is 2 3 hours by car from the capital city. The best room of this place is quite expensive. It costs 500 600 for one night. There are 2 distinctive spots in this place. The first spot is spa. The spa here is very famous and popular. The last time I tried it I was in a dreamy state and I really felt relaxed. Next to the spa the second relaxation spot in this place is the beach. The white sand and the blue green sea water appeal to everyone to go back there again and again. Moreover there are many interesting places near the resort such as good seafood restaurants ATV cars for adventure theater and etc. If I have a chance to go there again. That will be my excellent holiday for sure.
