When I came to the United States several months ago I had some difficulty understanding native speakers on the phone. I often couldn't figure out what they saying to me. I kept on asking the person to repeat sometimes I had to give up say sorry and hang up. However my English today is much better and I may build my speaking up by phone conversations but I give up by calls during dinner or when I would like to study or sleep. My wife asked me to turn the phone off at these times but I can't turn it off because I'm expecting an important calls from my mother and my friends in my country. When a telemarketer calls me during dinner time or later I say well! I'm sorry I'm eating now or I'm studying now and put the phone down. However when I have free time I usualy call my friend up and we may spend long time talking and if he is busy I might call him back to continue our talking.
