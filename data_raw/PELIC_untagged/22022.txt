I recommend you to let someone know that you are planning to go on a trip in case of emergency not like what Maready did. Don't forget to take enough provisions with you so you can use them in case you need to So you will avoid what happened with Aron when he ran out of food and water. Make sure that you prioritize your procedures before you leave Whatever the situation is you should be always brave heart
