Pasta Beans Fresh water Matches Maps of the area The first thing that I chose was a map of the area because with this you can be sure where you are and if you use well the map you wil not be lose. The second thing are some matches because with that you can obtain a fire where you can cook and also with the fire you will have something to warm you. The third and fourth thing that I chose some pasta and beans because with these you have something to eat and you need to eat something because the food provides you the necesary strength. And finally I chose a great deal of fresh water with this you will have something to drink and something that will keep you hydrated.
