Students always ask about how we can be good in the school. There are many things to do to be good. First of all come to the classes everyday as you can do. Second of all try to do your homework everyday. Furthermore ask your teachers to repeat the lesson if you didn't understand it or if you missed it. Later in your home ask your parents if you have any difficulty. Finally do your best to study for you quizzes. I hope my friends you are going to do well with those benefits.
