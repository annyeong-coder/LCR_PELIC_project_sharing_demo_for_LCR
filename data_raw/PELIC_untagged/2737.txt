My apartment is like a trash because all my roommates don't care about their rooms and even outside their rooms like dining room and bathroom. So they keep avoid to clean it all the time and except me to do it instead. I've tried talked to them to clean every thing up. However when you entered their rooms you will see their books every where on the floor also you will see tissues on the ground too. Moreover their bed isn't neat or arranged and when you come close to it you smell weird though. In the hall you will see their shoes there not on right place because they just throw it away. In addition sometimes you will see their shoes in dining room. Every thing in dinging room is missed up because no one put his things back when finish with it. They just leave it away until someone else comes and take it if he didn't find anything instead that.
