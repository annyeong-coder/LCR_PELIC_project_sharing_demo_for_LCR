I born in Erdent but I never being in Erdent in my life so last year me my girlfriend and with my 2 dogs we went to Erdent. We were in there 2 days that was most extremely strange trip in my life. Before we left Ulaanbaatar I checked my car all part and I tock extra oil and tire so I was really chore to all thing. Form Ulaanbaatar to Erdent there was not problem that time was a really cool. In the Erdent was a good and fun we went the hospital of I born and we skated there all day the dogs were enjoying the all thing. But in the time to return home the car did not start so we need to find the fixer but we wasn't lucky the all ready closed. Then I called my high school friend but his mother told me he went to Ulaanbaatar. So we sleep in car. That night was really cold and scary. In the morning I knew I forget gas. Finally we went back home.
