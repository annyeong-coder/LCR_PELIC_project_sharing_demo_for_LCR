Personal Letter Oct. 16 2006 Dear Mom Long time no see! Is everything okay in Taiwan I'm fine in Pittsburgh. The weather changes quickly and my skin becomes dry. Hence I want to buy hand cream to protect my hands. But I'm so confused about two products one is Crabtree Evelyn Crabtree another is L'OCCITANE. Although they are similar in protecting my hands from becoming dry there are many differences between Crabtree and L'OCCITANE. First they have different sizes and prices. The smallest size in Crabtree is 1. 7 Fl oz. And costs 7. 00 And in L'OCCITANE is 1 fl oz. And costs 9. 00. The content in L'OCCITANE is less than in Crabtree but the price in L'OCCITANE is more expensive than Crabtree. The large size in Crabtree is 3. 4 Fl oz. Costs 14. 00 And in L'OCCITANE is 5. 2 Fl oz. Costs 25. 00. The content in L'OCCITANE is bigger than it in Crabtree and the price in L'OCCITANE is still more expensive than Crabtree. If I want to use hand cream for a long time I should buy L'OCCITANE. However I think that L'OCCITANE is too expensive for me to buy it. In addition L'OCCITANE hand cream is blended with alluring aromas of jasmine and ylang ylang essences and Crabtree hand cream blended with rose water. Hence the flavors in L'OCCITANE are richer than those in Crabtree. However the flavors in Crabtree smell better than L'OCCITANE. If you were me which one you prefer to buy it or have you ever used them before I need your suggestions please reply to my letter. LOVE
