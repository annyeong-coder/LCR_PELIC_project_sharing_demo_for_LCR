After finishing high school I made the decision that would change my life as a young man I decided to continue my studies in the United States. Also if I weren't in the U. S especially in Pittsburgh I wouldn't have nice friends from all over the world. Therefore I'm glad that I did not accept the alternative choice that was going to other country. Moreover I wouldn't have lovely and friendly teachers if I were studying in other country. If I were in a different city in the U. S I wouldn't stay for a long time in the U. S. Finally I wish all my classmates in high school weren't studying in different countries. If I hadn't come to the U. S I wouldn't have improved my English.
