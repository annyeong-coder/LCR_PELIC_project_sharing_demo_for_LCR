When I met my husband for the first time he was planting strawberries. We were university students and we were taking part in the same gardening club. It was a warm spring day. In our garden there was a plum tree and white plum flowers were blooming. It was one of the most beautiful scenes about him. He was majoring in robotics and he was familiar with computer. He often talked about computers and it was fun for me. Although I majored in biology I chose computer software engineering as my first job.
