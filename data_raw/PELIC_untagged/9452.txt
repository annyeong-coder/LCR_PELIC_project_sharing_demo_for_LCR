Hi everyone. Let me introduce myself today. My name is Yuko and I'm from Japan. I'm the oldest student among you however I really enjoy studing English in the ELI with you. Now I'm living in the Summerset near to Frick Park. In addition my hobbies are reading books listening to the music and playing golf. Actually for me Pittsburgh is amazing because there are a lot of golf courses and we can enjoy it reasonably. I am looking forward to spring to play golf again. I wish winter would end soon! If you have some questions about me please do not haste to ask me. See you on next Monday!
