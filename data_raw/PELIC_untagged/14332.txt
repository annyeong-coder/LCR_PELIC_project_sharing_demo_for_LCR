The store which sold many kinds of homemade ice cream was a important place for me. The restaurant name is NABI'S ICECREAM. NABI'S ICECREAM was my neighbor's store whose son is my best friend. My friends used to go the store after school which was always crowded. Now I can't go there so I miss them and NABI'S ICE CREAM.
