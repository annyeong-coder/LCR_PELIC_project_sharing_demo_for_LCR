When I was around eight I remember flying to the Dominican Republic. It was the first I got to see the ocean. I went there with my family who were just as excited as I was. We stayed in Santo Domingo where the water was light blue and the sand had the same color as the sun. I had never felt so small after standing in front of an endless landscape my eyes couldn't be capable understand. Such a novelty started changing my life's perspective which still has a long way for being accurate.
