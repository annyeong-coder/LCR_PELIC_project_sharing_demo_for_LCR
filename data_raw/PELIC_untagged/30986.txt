Friday like other weekday is a difficult day for us a difference of a regular Sunday my husband and I have many chores before 8 am my daughter who is fifth grader takes the school bus at 7. 20 Am her breakfast should be ready at 6. 45 In contrast with us that we take breakfast around 7. 30 If we have time my dear husband usually do the hard work he wakes up early in the morning to run and he goes to sleep early around 10 pm with my baby on the contrary I go to bed really late because I am busy with other course that I am taking that is not and ELI course course and I have another project that I work with a professor. I can go to bed around midnight or later then in the morning I take the baby to the daycare then I take the bus and I go to CL I do not want to justify why sometimes I am late to the ELI lately I feel burn out after the ElI I have to pick up my other daughter then we headed home and I prepared our lunch on Tuesday and Thursday I have lectures in the evening and my daughter goes to her swim team on Wednesday I have a meeting with my group for our group project and I go back to my home very late around midnight. Sometime I go to study in the West penn library where I do not have access to my pitt account this can be a problem but the advantage is that West penn library is very close to my home only two blocks unlike pitt that is farther. Sunday can be more relaxed for us but I always I have homework to do is still a difficult day but unless we can take breakfast together.
