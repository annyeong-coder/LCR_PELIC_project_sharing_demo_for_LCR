The Tibetan antelope is an endangered animal which lives on the Tibet Platean of China. Their wool is very soft and warm. The wool can be made into hahtoosh shawls which are very rare and popular in the fashion industry. But the wool can only be obtained by killing the Tibetan antelope. Consequently its number has dropped from nearly a million in 1990 to less than 75 000 today. Since 1983 the chinese goverment has built up many natural reserves to protect the Tibetan antelope. But the number of the Tibetan antelope continues dropping yearly. If we want to make real progress we need stricter laws and to reinforce publicity.
