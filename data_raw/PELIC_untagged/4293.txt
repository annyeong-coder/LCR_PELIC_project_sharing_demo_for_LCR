I usually use it for sarfing or sending email. Once I start to use the Internet I always forget the time and spend time longer than I think. So I try to decide how much I spend time using the Internet a day before using it. Actually I use the Internet everyday and even if I go on a trip I take my PC with me. If I don't check my e mail box for one day I can't help cheching it and I'll get bunch of e mails.
