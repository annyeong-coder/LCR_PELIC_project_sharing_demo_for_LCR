I agree with ANON_NAME_0's opinion which stereotype is helpful to resolve conflict. I think we lives with much information and the strength of contemporary technology is using useful information which seems not useful before analysis. In other words there is no useless information in the world. From my perspective stereotype is the same as other information. The stereotype is a result from people's experience and observation even though it could be wrong. Therefore we should use it to understand the stereotype group. It can be a good start to analyze a group especially we don't have much information. At least we could use it to find out why there exists such a wrong stereotype for the group when the stereotype is different from the truth.
