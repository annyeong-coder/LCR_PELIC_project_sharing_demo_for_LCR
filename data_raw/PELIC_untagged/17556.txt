What I would do if I won the lottery I buy 2 tickets every week. One reason is for a donation another reason is to wish to win money. And I always think If I won 30 600 000 dollars in the loottery I'd like to do three important things. First I'd like to donate 100 000 to the Mt. Lebanon public library. Recently because of the economy crisis the library funds from the government was cut down too much the library is facing problems of buying new books and supporting programs. The librarians are trying to get back on their feet. They call for volunteers for selling used books tapes and others such as candies coffee cards etc. They are strugling to continue to offer the best services. So if I won a lootery I couldn't wait to give them a help. Second I would buy a land. Thus I can grow some flowers and vegetable that I like and consequently I can have some fresh and organic vegetable. Spoiling greens in the stores affect my emotion and appetite That the reason why I want to plant by myself. Third as a result of winning 30 600 000 I can afford my kids college tuition and I don't need to work for living so I have much time to take good care of my children and since I love children especially I dream of having a girl therefore I'd like to have one more baby. Keep purchasing lottery tickets there is always a chance to win. And if I am lucky to hit I would do some charities have my own farm and may have my third baby. It would be wonderful!
