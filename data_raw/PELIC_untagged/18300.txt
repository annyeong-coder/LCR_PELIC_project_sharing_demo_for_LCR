When I was child I used to go park with my friend who lived in next to my house. The park which was beautiful flowers and fountain was just three blocks from my house. I usually rode on a swing on the other hand my friend whose name is Hanako rode on a slide. After that we visited other friend house which was near the park. She was same pre school. I liked to go her house where there were many beautiful dolls. This is the memory of my childhood.
