When I was leaving to the English class in my country I spoke with my classmates and I told goodbye. After I was going to my house in my car when a car crashed with my car. I out my car and the man the another car spoke with me he told me that he didn't see the car while I was speaking with the man I called my parents and I told what happened. And after when I finished to speak with my parents I called of tow truck. And when I was speaking the man my parents came and they spoke with the man. After when my father and I spoke with the man the tow truck was arriving my car. I was very nervous while I was speaking and saying goodbye to the man the another car. I went to my house with my parents and when I was with them I only could speak about that happened me. While I was going to my house my brother called and I spoke with him. I arrived to my house and I ate the dinner while I was speaking with my family after I went to sleep because I was very nervous.
