Movies and Cultural Effects As Movies' industry is growing nowadays I think foreign movies are a good way to learn about different countries and cultures. The Audience will have an idea about customs or problems that exist in a movie's culture. For example US movies show drug addiction as a problem and it is the reason of different crimes which is true in some U. S. Cities. Some of these movies show the American culture and customs that American citizens have. Another example European movies show the hot spots or areas which are interesting for the tourists. This gives the audience an idea about where to go for entertainment. On the other hand Arabic movies show the Arabic and Islamic culture such as men who pray in a mosque or women who wear Hijab. All of this shows how movies represent the culture in where they are made.
