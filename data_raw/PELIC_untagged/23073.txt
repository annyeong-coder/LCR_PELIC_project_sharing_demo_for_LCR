Savorgnan de Brazza Monument is a beautiful place near to the Congo river in Brazzaville Congo. The monument was built in stone arches a little far from the center of the place. On the top it is smaller than it becomes bigger at its base. It has four faces. The sculpture has a color that gives a yellow sand wet consist of red black and white granulates. At its base there is an inscription made in metal in memory of Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza. On both side there are green grass and small ways. On the left side after grass there are houses and on the right side the Residence of the France Embassy. It extends till the entrance of the monument. At the entrance of the place a main way marked out by street lights on both sides. There is a nice garden of the left side all the along main way. It is under the trees and has public chairs small soccer terrain and garden lamps. The garden gives the fresh smell of the grass and of all natural compounds. Behind the sculpture a wonderful place well decorated in many colors gives the view to the congo river. We can see the border of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Sometimes it is very cold in the monument when the wind blows and the river gives its cold back. The grateful clear blue of the sky and the deep blue of the river give a sensitive atmosphere. A soft wind blows and move grass and flowers in a movement almost regular around the sculpture. That gives back the environment peaceful. Finally Savorgnan de Brazza Monument is not maybe the better place in Brazzaville but its geographic placement near the river and surround by natural garden make him unique and wonderful.
