It was about two years when I was in University we went Diyarbakir a city in Turkey for a philosophy festival. My University provided places to stay. It was different and I learned a lots about Philosophy. There were a lot of students from different universities around of Turkey. We listened them discussed some ideas and shared our feelings. We visited special and ancient places which belong our culture. And went to Batman a city near of Diyarbakir to saw Hasankeyf. Because this place would stay under the water after a short time. It was great I have never seen a place like that. We stayed there about 5 days it was a good experience. Because Diyarbakir locates east part of the Turkey. It is too far us. It was like to met a new country. We tasted new foods special things talked people and visited our famous author's home C. Sitki Taranci .
