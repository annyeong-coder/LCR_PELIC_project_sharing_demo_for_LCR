First day I came to study in ELI. I met my classmate Chi ANON_NAME_0 and his aunt. His aunt introduced us to eat in LuLu's restaurant. She said LuLu's restaurant sold Hong ANON_NAME_1 Chinese Taiwan and Thai foods. You can eat Asia food in there variety. It's popularity in Okland. I saw a lot of Korean people to eat in here. I ordered the Hong ANON_NAME_1 roast pork in my first time. I ate the most delicious mushrooms in my life. Second time I ate with ELI teacher and students at night when we finished ELI activity. I ate Thai Curry it had chicken potato hot pepper mix with curry. It tastes a little spicy and smooth. I through it was delicious in LULU's restaurant for me. I usually went to here ate lunch with my classmate. I wish always ate delicious food in LuLu's restaurant.
