When I was a teenager in the Philoppines I was an expert on snacks and fast foods. I was growing fast so the more I ate the hungrier I felt. The street venders in our town had the better snacks than anyoneelse. In the morning I used to buy rice muffins on the way to school. They are as much as sweeter than American muffins. After school I ate fish balls on a stick or adidas chiken feet . Snacks on a stick are as small as than American hot dogs and burgers but they are much varied. My friend thought banana cue banana on a stick was really great. However they weren't as sweet as than kamote cue fried sweet potatoes and brown sugar my favorite snack. When I came to the United States I didn't like American fast food at first. To me it was as interesting as than my native food and less tastier too. Now I 'm getting used to it and it seemes more and more dericious. Does anyone want to go out for a pizza
