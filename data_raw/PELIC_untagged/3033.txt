Dear Mr. ANON_NAME_0 I am a student at the EFL Computer Training Institute. My classes are very good but I'd like to improve at classroom. I think you should put away waste on your desk. And You had better change broken windows. And you ought to fix ceiling. Also you should polishe the the floor with the dustcloth. And you ought to empty the trash. And you had better change to put up the wallpaper it pastes on the wall. I wish that you should do that. I think that is very perfect.
