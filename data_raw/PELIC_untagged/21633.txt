ANON_NAME_0 who is about to graduate from his high school has to make a crucial decision about his career. His father whose father was also an army officer is an army officer and he strongly wants his son to be an army officer just like him. However ANON_NAME_0 is reluctant to follow his father's career because he doesn't like discipline and physical hardship in the military service. Also he thinks he is an inherently gentle creative young man and he wants to be an artist.
