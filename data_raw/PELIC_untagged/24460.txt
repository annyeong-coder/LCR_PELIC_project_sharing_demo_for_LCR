Luke Skywalker's life is pretty similiar with a typical hero's journey except one characteristics. Although Luke didn't have diffculty of birth he had not gotten the pastrimony from his father since he became adult. He lost his parents when he was young and was fostered by his uncle and aunt. Therefore since he didn't know well about his parents he just help his uncle's farm and want to go back to school. This is a period of quiescence and it lasted until Obiwan Kenobi who is one of the sidekicks that Luke has let him know about his father. He received the princess's message and decided to go to 'alderran'. In the process his sidekicks who are Obiwan Kenobi Han Solo and two droids helped him a lot. Finally they destroy the death star and bring freedom to galaxy.
