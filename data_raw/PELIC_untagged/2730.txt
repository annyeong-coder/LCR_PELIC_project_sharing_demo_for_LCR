When I rant my apartment it was ugly dirty and very sunny even you can't sleep in the morning at the weekends. But now it's different. I put the curtains up on the windows. I touch the walls up in two days. I picked up new furniture and TV. I passed the old air conditioner up because it was broken. Finally I did my apartment up.
