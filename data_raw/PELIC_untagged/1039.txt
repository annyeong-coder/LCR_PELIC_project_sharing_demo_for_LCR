David I think maybe we can bring a book which can teach us some skills useful in the desert. Richard No! We can read it and learn the skills right now instead of bringing the book to the desert. Bringing a kettle must be useful. We can have some water inside the kettle once we find the water. David Yes a kettle is really useful. Besides a kettle we have to bring a knife. I think we will need to cut something there. Richard I agree. Should we bring a compass David That's a good idea. The desert maybe the same everywhere we need a compass to avoid lose our way. Richard Great! So we should bring a kettle a knife and a compass with us. I think we can win the competition in the final!
