How did the great statue get to Easter Island I'm so interested in the mstery of Easter Island. I think the indigine who had already disapeared must have made some statues called Moai using the rocks on the islands. The Moai statues seem to be human beings so the islanders might have made the statues as a God in oredr to worship. They could have had the ritual in front of the statues. However suprisingly some of them on Easter island are facing toward the ocean so the islanders might have made them to make other tribes threaten. I've heard there are two types Moai statues there one type has long ears and the other one has short ears so there must have been a tribe who had long ears and the other r tribe who had short ears. One of them may have been indigine and the other ones might have conquared them. The invaders could have rebuild some statues. I've also heard that the travelers to Easter island may feel somthing starange and chage the way to think for their lives when or after they see the Moai statues. Actually a friend of mine who taveled there told me she felt the power of the will so the Moai statues might have some mysterious powers which any scientists can't proof.
