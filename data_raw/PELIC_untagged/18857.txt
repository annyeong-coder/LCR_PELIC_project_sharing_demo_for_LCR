My parents are the main role in my life. In my childhood they were busy in work. They made me do anything by myself. I need to clean my room and help with the housework. They had me learn to cook. Sometimes my mother didn't have time to prepare my lunch I must cook. They got me to take care of my young brother. I had to take lessons after school and I must bring him together. They didn't let me stay out until midnight every day. They thought it be dangerous. All things were difficult when I was a kid. However they helped me to have more good behave.
