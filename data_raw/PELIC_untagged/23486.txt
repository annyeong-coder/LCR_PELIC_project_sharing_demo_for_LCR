Studying abroad in the USA was one of my determination decisions I have ever made. It determines my whole life and future because coming to the USA was my own decision ever since my brother Jassem came back to Kuwait my country from Pittsburgh having gotten DMD. We had an interesting time together and talked and conversed. I impressed of the way he thoughts ideas and ideals. When he went back to Pittsburgh I talked to him and he arranged the ELI program for me to join and improve my English so I can start my life complete my study in America and emulate him. Also if I made a different decision I would be that loser who works at his father's company and rely on him. Or that guy who gets a benefits from people skills. I decided my own decision to establish myself and take what called no body to become somebody .
