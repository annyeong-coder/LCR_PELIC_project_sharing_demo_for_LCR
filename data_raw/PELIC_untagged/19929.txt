I think it is important for parents to pass on cooking skills to their childern because they need them to be capable to help themselves to cook the appropriate food for them or their guests. Also the childern need to learn the process of food cooking from their parenets's approach. And by parents following up their childern it will be no challenges facing them when they are cooking something. By the way the normal way to learn cooking begins at home and the childern learn the basic requirments of cooking from their parents. In deed It is significant for the childern to get how can they cook them food from their parents experiences.
