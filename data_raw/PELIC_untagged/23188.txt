My feeling before I came here is counting on what I was doing in my life. Something I remember it right know is I grew up with a good feeling. I wish if I could bring my felling back. Because when I have a good feeling usually I throw my problems away and keep focusing on my way of life. I have a bad feeling and I would like to change it. When I figure out some emotion I should knew it early. Like some girl likes my I find out that emotion too lately. So I should look into my feeling and what feeling do I have and I would like to tell anyone to go over about his or her feeling and find out what feeling did he or she miss.
