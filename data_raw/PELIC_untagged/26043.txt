My friend Eric who was working couple years in Japan and he has chanced to work in Saudi Arabia and he is very excited. I'd like to give him a couple advices before he'll go there. First of all YOU'D BETTER KEEP the crucial documents in safe palace. YOU OUGHT TO CALL YOUR BOSS BY HIS NICKNAME like doctor or teacher . YOU'D BETTER NOT SHAKE HANDS WHEN YOU MEET A FEMALE and YOU SHULD SHAKE HANDS FRIENDS EVERY TIME YOU MEET THEM. YOU SHOULD ASK FOR SECOND helping of food when you're a guest. YOU SHOULDN'T MAKE NOISE in Public Places. Finally YOU OUGH TO SEEK some data from Internet will help you too. Have fun and enjoy your time.
