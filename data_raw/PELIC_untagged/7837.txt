I studied high school in Taiwan. After I graduated from high school I went to Japan for college. My major was business but I wasn't interested in it that much at that time. Hence I decided to have school in the USA. Right now I am studying English as second language program in Eli. I hope I will be accepted by University of Pittsburgh in Fall 2008 and the school can take all my back home credits that I don't have to spend more years to finish undergraduate. I didn't know how to cook before I came to this country. Now I am cooking for myself and I have learned some Taiwanese cuisine. It is a good experience for me to live by my own. To tell you the truth I have been eating homemade cakes for two weeks. I think it's time to change my cooking style because I am really sick of it.
