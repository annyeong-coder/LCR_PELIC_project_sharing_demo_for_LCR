My room My room in Taiwan is designed in Japanese style almost everything's color is the color of wood. The door of the room is made from sandalwood and there are several tatamis covering up the floor. There is not much furniture and decoration placed in my room. Because of this my mother always wants to hang up some paintings or posters there in order to cheer me up. But that is not my style I told my mom I will tear down everything on the wall. The room is simple and bright and that is the way I like it to be. Though the space in the room helps me calm down easily it is also the biggest and the only disadvantage of my room. It is too peaceful there and makes me lie down easily. Due to this I always do my homework assignments in the living room. The environment there cheers me up easily. I want to make my room bigger in order to have more space. Maybe when I go back to Taiwan I will throw the tatamis away. Just to build up more space and change the room into a better place to live.
