Over the last two years my boyfriend helped me change my life. He helped me become mature and made me consider about my future. I also learned from him and his mistakes becoming a more patient person in the process. My education is another example three years ago I quit school. Last year my boyfriend brought me to America and found me a school. Ever since then I have been learning English and the American culture. In this regard my boyfriend has really opened my eyes. On another matter I have been having him teach me English pronunciations and got him to help me do my homework. He lets me make a lot of mistakes. However he is always laughing at my mistakes and making me feel inferior.
