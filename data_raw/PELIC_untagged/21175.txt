As a foreign student using perfect English is almost impossible to me. In many situation I use fractured or broken English like fragment. Just doesn't have subject or object Since I know a little vocabulary to speak complicate sentences makes me strained also. Although to use impeccable English is important to use break Englsh is important too as It does make sense ussally. In my opinion we should use correct English but not always. It depends on the situation. When we are talking with friend we enjoy using some kinds of slang or not perfect sentences. However If we have meeting formally we use formal and correct English.
