There are two important soccer players in the world who are Ronaldinho and Zinedine Zidane. Both of them are famous and they have different features. For instance Zidane is slower than Ronaldinho but he can anticipate or create the next movement easily and act according to it. Ronaldinho can act quickly and is more energetic than Zidane. Ronaldinho's shoots are faster than Zidane's. Zidane is better scrumhalf. In my mind Ronaldinho is not as famous as Zidane. Because Zidane is less selfish than Ronaldinho during a game.
