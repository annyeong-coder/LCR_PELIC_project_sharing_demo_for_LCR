After finishing high school I go a scholarship from the ministry of higher education. They gave three alternative choices Australia Germany as well as the United States. I had to choose one of those countries. I wanted to study in Australia but they refused my request. They canceled the program In Australia. Therefore I had opted to choose between Germany and the United States. So I chose to start my future in the United States. Now I have been in the U. S for nine months. I have had a good live. I started thinking if I was accepted in Australia or Germany what will happened. If the ministry of higher accepted me I would not have friends from all over the world. I might not have beautiful girlfriend. Also if I were accepted in Germany I would not improve my English. If I had not go to the U. S I would still be study in King ANON_NAME_0 University. If I had been accepted in Australia I would not be the represent for the Saudi Students house. My friend wishes that I had not been accept for the scholarship. Finally that was my destiny so I had to accept it and live with it. Don't hate something that could be good for you. .
