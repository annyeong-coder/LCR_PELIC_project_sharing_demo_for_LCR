I had never pronounced R sound before I reached fifteen years old. I used to pronounce it like G sound so I had fought some friends because they mocked me before I was able to pronounce it. By twelve year old I had lost the hope to pronounce because someone told me that you will be capable of pronouncing before twelve. When I started the high school I had already been able to pronounce it. It was one of the best moments of my life.
