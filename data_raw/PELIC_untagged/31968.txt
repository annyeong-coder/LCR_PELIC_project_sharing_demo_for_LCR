On February 21 2012 my classmates and I created a time capsule. We dug in the moon and we put it there. The capsule contains 7 items. Each item tells something about our lives in the date mentioned above. First we put money inside the capsule to show that we was using this paper money to buy what we want. Probably you are using fingerprints to buy. The second thing we put is a wallet which we put the money and cards inside it. The third thing is a credit card. We used this card to pay. The fourth is a pen which we use to write. The fifth is a remote control. We were using it to change the channels and control the volume. In addition we put a cell phone that used for contact other people. Finally there is a laptop was used for connect the internet save documents and watch movies. You are probably in 3012 and you do not Know these stuffs. So I put it to show you some about our things. Regards
