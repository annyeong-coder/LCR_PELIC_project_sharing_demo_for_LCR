This lecture is about what Myth is. The lecturer Gail Lavender pointed that Myth is an anonymous traditional story which had been orally passed down from one generation to the next and believed to be literally true by the culture from which comes. It is usually about god hero and fantastic creatures. She also compared Myth with legend and folktale. Three of them are all made by anonymous have narrative and are orally passed down through generations. However there are humans in legend and symbolic characters in folktale as a main character not like god in myth. Moreover legend and folktale are not literally believed and sometimes it could be invented by an author.
