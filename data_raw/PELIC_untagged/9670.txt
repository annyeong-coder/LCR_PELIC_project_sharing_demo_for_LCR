The best meal experience I've ever had happened about 3 months ago. With my friend I went to Greenwich Village in New York for shopping. We were so engrossed in our work that we forgot to eat. In addition we had missed lunch the day so we felt hungry. She told me she had an idea for a light meal. I accepted her offer. And we began to find the location of the Magnolia Bakery. Actually the store was located in the center of Bleeckers st but unfortunately we wandered about in the street. 2 Hours later we hunted out the store's address. When we arrived there we were shocked because many people had been gathered together to be a part of particular event. We kept waiting for three whole hours for cupcakes. Finally our turn came round. We bought huge banana cupcake filled with vanillas cream. It was amazing. I thought it was so much better than homemade cupcakes. The cupcake was really delicious. Efforts of waiting were finally rewarded.
