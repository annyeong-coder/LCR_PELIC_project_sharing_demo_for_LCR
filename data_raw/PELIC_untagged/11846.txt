When you eat lunch with your friend sometimes it's difficult for you to choose food. But don't worry about that because we have Uncle Sam's. My favorite food shop is Uncle Sam's. If you're a Pitt student maybe you heard about Uncle Sam's at least. First of all Uncle Sam's is sandwiches restaurant and that's tastes good. Maybe taste is a very important thing in restaurants. So I like Uncle Sam's. That's perfect. Second Uncle Sam's has many menu options so you have a free choice to follow your type. And when I visit Uncle Sam's that shop's staff is always kindly. And many people there always eat there. Finally they are located near by Pitt. So if you want to go there it takes just 10minutes. So my favorite restaurant is Uncle Sam's. If you want to eat good sandwiches I'll recommend to Uncle Sam's for you. And if you go to there with me call me please.
