Woojae Jeung was my favorit professor when I was a univeristy school student in Korea. He has studied Environmental engineer for 40 years. And he has been a water treatment' professor since 1978. Also he has solved many probelms of water quality since he became a professor. In addition he is an enthusiastic professor. For example I have never seen that he was absent his own class. Also he has published a lot of books about his major for a long time.
