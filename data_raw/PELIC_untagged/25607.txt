I sit up every morning and face my window. The sun at my window makes me feel happy. The smell of food fills up my house because my housemates cook everyday. I do not like this because it wakes me up and makes me hungry. My room is big but my bed takes up half the space. To make my room feel like home I hang up pictures of my family. There is always clothes on my bed and this brings me down. To fix this I hang up my clothes in the closet after taking them out off the drier. Every Thursday the housemates and I take turns taking out the trash. I do not want to take it out because the trash smells. During the summer my room is hot everyday. Maybe if I open up the door and windows the room would be cooler. Also if I clean out the room more often it would feel cleaner and fresher.
