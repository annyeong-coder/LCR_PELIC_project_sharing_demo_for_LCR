The biggest environmental problem is poor water quality especially in countryside in China. In big cities people get serious disease easily because many factories discharge manufacturing wastes to the river which is the crucial cause of poor water quality. However for a long time the Chinese government concentrated on environment protection for big cities manufacturing places nature areas and also historical landscapes that reduced water pollution in cities. Recently in some rural areas of China experts find out that water pollution is worse than cities. There are several reasons that make poor quality of drinking water. First of all at many far away rural areas farmers are using herbicide largely which causes serious pollution of water and also badly influences their health. Second the damaging of forests makes a big shortage of water and soil which forces people to drink river water. However the river water is not good for people to drink. For instance farmers throw away trashes to the river and some people even throw dead poultries to the river close by their houses. Poor water quality brings many diseases and it also makes a big increasing amount of people die for cancer. I think the society and the government should pay more attention to water quality in rural areas in China. Many diseases spread quickly through drinking water of poor quality. If they don't solve the environmental problem there will be more tragedies to people who live in countries.
