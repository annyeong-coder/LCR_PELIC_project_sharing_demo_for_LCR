These days Pittsburgh's weather cheers me up because the weather is really great. By the way my home brings me down. This is because my home is usually messy so I have to straighten up my room. I should hang up my clothes and throw away wastes. Actually I want to give up doing this but I have to hand this in to the OSS. Therefore I am doing this now.
