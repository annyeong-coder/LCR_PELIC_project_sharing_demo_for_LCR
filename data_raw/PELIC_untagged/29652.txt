Today the Pittsburgh Post Gazette points out in one of its columns a big accident which took place in Downtown and blocked the traffic during several hours. The policemen quickly intervened on the scene of the accident. One of the policemen asked the driver of the Jeep which were the circumstances of the accident. The man exclaimed It is not of my fault! I came within the intersection and she charged at me! The policeman noted that it was the only vehicle coming from the left to enter on the intersection. So he asked him which was the color of the traffic light. The man stammered Hmm green I think . The second policeman questioned the Toyota's driver who was a woman. She explained calmly that the other driver had to run the stoplight. She added that he had offended her and had not wanted to show her his insurance card. A witness who was answering the questions of the journalist from Post Gazette noticed that the driver of the Jeep drove very fast and indicated to the policemen tire tracks on the road. The journalist ends by saying that this intersection was very dangerous. He says to the policemen that a similar accident had occurred 2 days before.
