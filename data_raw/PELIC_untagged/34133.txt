Since I was 6 years old when the school finished I had been spending 3 weeks in my maternal grandparents' country villa which they lived in during the spring and the summer. This place where there were a swimming pool and a tennis court was amazing. I usually played tennis with my cousin Massimo who was 2 years older than me and I often won. The villa had two floors in the first one there were the living room the kitchen and a huge patio where we usually had lunch and dinner the second floor comprised 6 rooms 2 bathrooms and 4 bedrooms which had a northern exposure. Near the patio there was a barbecue which we used for the dinner when we decided to eat grilled hamburgers and hot dogs.
