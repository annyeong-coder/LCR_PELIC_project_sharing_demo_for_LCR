Ithink the weather is getting worse. I heard thunders today but there wasn't many rains. Typhoon and stayed in bed. Istarted reading brave new world . October31 . I'm 21 today . To celebrate I drank a little coffee for breakfast and I opened my presents. I got some perumes and pretty silver jewelries. November1. The electicitie are low. I'd better save them until I get near land . I'll need the rdio then . It reined today so colleted a little for cooking.
