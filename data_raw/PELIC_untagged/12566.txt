There are many places which I did not forget and that I had a good remembrance in. One place my brother's house which I fall down from it roof when we were built. Another place Sobrata where we visit every year and which located on the west coast of my country and that has a beautiful beach where I spent some days every summer with my friends who grew up with. I remember our first visit which we are lost in. Also I love a country where my uncle was live he was live in a quite country which has many trees and a nice view. My uncle has a farm there where he was work with hi s family. There were many animals that I was enjoy to play with .
