Last year I chatted with my cousin on the phone he was talking about his new living in U. S. In Chicago. THAT the weather was frigid in the winter he said he was almost crazy. He told me the temperature was 20F. Actually I can't image HOW COLD it was. I was impressed by THAT climbing the high mountain last year it was almost 32F. It's a hell which I have known. Suddenly I was aspired by some physical experiments. I told him please went outside of the house and peed in this weather. I want to know HOW FAST it freezes and you can prove HOW COLD it was. I was curious about WHAT situation I can see Can I see any icicles
