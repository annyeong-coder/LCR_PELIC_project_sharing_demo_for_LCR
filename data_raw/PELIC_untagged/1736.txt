There are better overall organization and grammatical structures in my final draft. I wrote down much clear organization of introduction body and conclusion. I wrote clearer thesis statement in the introduction. I focus more on the specific idea. I believe the grammatical strutures in the final draft is more fluency. I correct some sentences from the second draft. Therefore in the final draft the sentences present more integrated meaning.
