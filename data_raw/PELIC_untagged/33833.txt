Good morning Today my guest speaker is king Sejong the great who is inventor and greatest hero in South Korea. His greatest achievement is the creation of the Korean alphabet Han Geul which is still being used today. Before creating the Han Geul Korean used Chinese letter only members of the highest class were literate. After realizing the problem he decided to create our own letters. If it were not created we might still use Chinese letter instead of Han Geul. Han Geul is the most scientific writing system in the world which is on the UNESCO world heritage list. Fortunately from 2000 being interested in everything the Han Geul is used a lot to promote that Hollywood stars who are wearing clothes decorated with the Hangul alphabet and some sports stars in the US even have tatoos in Korean. Now you know about king sejong the great. So without further ado please welcome King sejong the great.
