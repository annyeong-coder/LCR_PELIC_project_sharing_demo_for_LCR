last week I was sopposed to go to New York but my friend wanted to stay in NY until Monday night. This was not the plan he changed it. He might have told me about his new plan before a week. I should not have accepted his invitation to go with him to NY because I wanted to visit NY very badly . I could have taken nice pictures in Time Square if he told me about his plans.
