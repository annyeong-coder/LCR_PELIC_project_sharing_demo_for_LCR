A time when I ran out of money The worse experience I have ever had with run out of money was four years ago when I first moved to Taipei. Taipei is one of big city in my country. After the first week working I went shopping alone. It was a sunny day. First I went to a mall and bought many clothes and a lot of daily appliances. Then I went to a supermarket to buy some fruit many cookies and several condiments. After my shopping I spent lots of money. So I felt I had to go home before I ran out of money. But at this moment I met a cosmetician she promoted the sales of cosmetic. At that time I wanted to say No I don't need cosmetic instead of I don't know how to use them. But I didn't. So she was very enthusiastic telling me how to use all products. Finally I bought the product by paying a great of money around 4 000 US with my credit card. After I got home I recognize all cosmetic cost me two and half month salary and I totally ran out of money. After this worse shopping experience I cut my credit card. Now when I go shopping each time I always remind myself don't ran out of money. ANON EMAIL
