The worst and surprising meal experience I've ever had happened at a restaurant in Kyoto Japan when I was a college student. Some students including me had a meeting of one of the classes at an inn. After the meeting we were served curry and rice for dinner. That curry contained many small black pieces. Apparently it was burned. I tried a spoon of the curry and rice. It didn't taste usual curry. I was very surprised because the inn was located near Heianjingu which is one of the most famous sightseeing spots in Kyoto. More surprisingly the other students began to eat it silently. I ate it reluctantly. After the dinner I asked one of the students why you finished that so fast. She said to me that there was nothing to eat except that. Indeed we became full but that tasted terrible. I have never eaten such curry and rice except that time.
