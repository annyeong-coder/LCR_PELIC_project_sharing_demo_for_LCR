I was born and grew up in Tokyo Japan. After I graduated from junior college I got a job. I had worked at a bank for ten years. I traveled abroad every year while I was working. Because I could have only 7days off each year I thought days off were very valuable. I have been to many foreign countries Italy Spain Austria Turkey Egypt etc. I have seen pyramid in Egypt. I have eaten authentic food in Italy and Spain. I have listened to music at the Vienna Opera House. Also I have visited many National Parks with my husband after we came to the U. S. I got many experiences on each trip. Actually I was living with my parents before I came to the U. S so I have never lived with my husband in Japan. When we go back Japan we will have different experience from which we have lived in the U. S.
