The beach in my city is very amazing. The beach is very clean and wide. In the dawn is magic. When see it in the morning is spectacular. At the night is windy and quiet. It is cold in the winter and waves like hills. In the summer the beach is crowded and looks colorful because different colors from umbrellas on it. Finally it is very beautiful and cool.
