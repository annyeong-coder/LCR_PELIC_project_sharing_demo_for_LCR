1 When I get good grade in Tofel I will be able to apply any school I want. 2 If I have stayed here more than two years I will have more fluency English speaking. 3 I won't come back to Pittsburgh again unless I my parents allow me to study abroad. 4 In case I have one million dollars I will have a world round trip. 5 Because I didn't study hard I will get a poor grade I guess. 6 After I finish this semester I will go back to my country which is really sad to me. 7 As soon as I get money from my parents I will go shopping with my friends. 8 Once I have a chance to be a Chinese teacher I will teach my students how to compliant me first. 9 Before I go back to Taiwan I will exert myself to learn English. 10 Although I am frustrated about my poor English I will find a better way to enhance my English ability.
