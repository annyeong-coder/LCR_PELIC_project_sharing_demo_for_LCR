A good paragraph I think a good paragraph presents the clear and precise point of view of the writer. This point of view can be supported by many details and examples. However most importantly the writer has to have his her own objective when they are writing about something. For example writing a clear topic sentence and presenting accurate support details are essential to writing a good paragraph. Also by using citations and quotations it increases the credibility of the writing. Adding your own experiences can support your paragraph to have credibility too. Although with all these good contents if the writer organizes these contents in the wrong place it's nothing but a combination of words. In conclusion a good paragraph has a well developed sentence structure with all those contents that I wrote above.
