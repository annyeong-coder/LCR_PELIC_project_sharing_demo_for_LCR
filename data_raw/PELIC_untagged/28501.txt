My Family Many changes happened for my family in last few years. My family has moved in a new house. They lived in an old house for 20 years and they have lived in the new house since 2008. My father retired 4 years ago and he has working in his own business since he retired. My mother was taking care of my siblings when she was studying. She decided to be a homemaker after she finished her education. Therefore she has been a home marker for many years. My brother ANON_NAME_0 was a single and he lived with my family last years. He has been mathematics' teacher since 2008 and he has married for 3 months. My younger brother works in hospital as an interpreter. He has been an interpreter since he finished his high school. He is determined to continue his education while he is working. Therefore He has studied at King ANON_NAME_1 University for one year.
