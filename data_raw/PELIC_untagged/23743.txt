The best mirror is an old friend . I think this means that old friend can tell you the truth and never deceive you. He can tell you right If you do a right thing and wrong If you do a bad thing. When I was in an intermediate school I met my best friend whose behaviour looked like mine . She was the person who I could trust . Most of our friends and teachers thought that we were twins. We beleived that our friendship was the relation which would last for ever.
