Yesterday was Memorial Day in the United States. I couldn't see many things such as flags on the street parade in Downtown because near my apartment there's a shopping mall. As a result I saw many people who wanted to buy something in Memorial Day clearance. On the other hand when I watched TV I saw a parade in another city. I could feel people's mind because in Korea we also have Memorial Day. In Korea they also held some parade in the middle of city. For example people who wear the same uniform walk on the street. Some people visit the National Cemetery carrying white flower.
