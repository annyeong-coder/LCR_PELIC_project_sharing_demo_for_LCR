Hi everybody. My name is ANON_NAME_0 Last Name . I'm from south Korea. Now I'm living in Shadyside. It's not far from Pitt. But It takes for long time on foot. So I have to take a bus every day to attend to class. I'm only studying English this year but I'm planning to get master's degree at Pitt after studying English. My hobby is photography. I used to take pictures near my home. However I'm not taking pictures these days because of classes. I will try to take photos on weekends. I want to have pleasant class this semester and fortunately everything is going with my expectation.
