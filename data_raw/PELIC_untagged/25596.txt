Last Saturday I went to the art festival on Walnut Street and it was really fun there before I hit the tree. This tree was not a normal tree. It was made of iron. I didn't know the tree would move. I wanted to get something behind the tree. So I went past the tree. When I was ready to go past the tree the tree moved. The first time I tried to avoid it I was not successful. After that I hit my forehead on the tree. The sound was really loud. Everyone asked me Are you ok . Even though they didn't know me they still cared about me. It was really nice. But when I hit my forehead it really hurt. Later it made me have a headache the rest of day. The next day I felt bad all day too because I was uncomfortable in whole day. I had a headache. So this was an awful weekend.
