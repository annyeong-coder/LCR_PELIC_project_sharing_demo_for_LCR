The eating habit in the U. S. And in Taiwan Intend The United States is the country in the American continent and Taiwan is the country in the Asian continent. There are so many differences between these two countries such as weather location races r breakfast. Cereal is a convenient food for breakfast because it is easy to prepare. However there are some experts query the nutrition of cereal is not high enough for a breakfast. On the other hand we eat plenty food as our break. In a traditional breakfast store we can find different kinds of food are served as breakfast. For example we may order a small rice roll a cup of soy milk and an egg as our breakfast. We believe that we need to eat a lot in our first meal to get the energy for whole day. Intend Third the taste is also different in the U. S. And in Taiwan. I think many of Americans eat saltier or sweeter than the Taiwanese. Because when I eat outside in the U. S. Most of the time I think the meal is a little salty for me. Even though I still can hear some customers ask some extra soy sauce for them to take out. Besides this if I buy chocolate here I usually find the taste is too sweet for me. Although the taste is different in different people however after I discussed with my Taiwanese friends who study in the U. S. They also have the same opinion as mine. Thus I think the taste is really different in these two countries. Intend As I mention above there are many different eating habit in the U. S. And in Taiwan. It is the totally different living custom causes the difference. However there is no good answer about which kind of eating habit is correct or not. Therefore we should learn which is good and suitable for us and try to improve our eating habit to make it becomes better.
