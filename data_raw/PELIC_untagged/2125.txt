It's night now. A sky above Boston is clearly dark blue without cloud. The weather likes in winter. Every building turns the light on. This make the city light up at night. There is the highest building on the right hand side of the picture. The building is a large rectangular. The light in the building shows that there are a lot of people who are working in the building. This building is surrounded by a lot of smaller buildings. On the left hand side there is another high building. The building is a modern thin. There are also a lot of light in the building. Beyond the city is a river along the city. The river looks very quiet and peaceful because this time is winter so people in Boston would like to stay in the building or their house. I had been in Boston before I started the ELI classes. Boston is a livable and peaceful city. When I walked along the street it looks like the city in my dream. There are buildings along two sides of the street. The most memorable point for me is there is a river through the city. The city is separated by this river. When I was in one side of the river I could see the opposite site of Boston clearly. That is very beautiful big antique city. I was so impressed and excited of seeing the wonderful city that I have never seen before.
