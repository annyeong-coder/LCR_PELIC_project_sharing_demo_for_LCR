My apartment is so sunny and it always cheers me up when I get back from a hard day at school. First thing I do when I enter my apartment is hang up my coat and turn on the TV because I like to watch news channel at 5 clock. After that I eat my lunch because I do not like to eat out. Some times I would like to make some changes in living room like take the carpet off and throw old chair away. At night I start do my homework and try to figure out some words and I am happy when I learn new thing. Usually I be happy when I go to library to take some books out and sit down to read them.
