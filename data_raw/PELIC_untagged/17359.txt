My aprtment is not good. Before I came here I looked up information about housing on the internet. I look over lots of apartments. Finally I pick out an apartment. Before I arrived in pittsburgh I expected my apartment. As soon as I arrived at my apartment I let down my apartment. Because my apartment was very cramped dirty and uncomfortable. The apartment brought me down. I thought that if I put up my house I would change my apartment. First of all after I call off my rent I straighten up my apartment. To be specific I throw out the trash And then I set up a billiard table in living room. After I take away paint of the wall I will paint the wall into white. I will think over changing my aprtment more.
