Saving endangered animals According to biologists if we don't try to save an animal the animal will become extinct. Within 20 years the number of births will be lowered than the number of death's. It is should occur they will be called endangered animals. Plenty of creatures died because of reasons such as flood drought and eruption of volcano. However presently human beings are the main reason. There are several reasons for instance deforestation and excessive hunting. Many animals are losing their habitat because of the destruction of trees. Also we have settled many laws about the excessive hunting. But actually illegal hunting is still happening in Africa. We should strengthen the law of saving endangered animals.
