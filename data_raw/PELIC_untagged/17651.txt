I heart mom By Meagan Francis A child in his early months can have different ways to say I Love You to his mother. From birth to six months the baby can show his love by smiling and staring at his mother's face. From six months to twelve months the baby asks that the mother will hold him by reaching out with his arms. Also in this age he starts giving wet kisses. The baby understands object permanence so he might be very sad when his mother leaves him even for a few minutes.
