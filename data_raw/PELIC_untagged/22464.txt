In Korea a lot of parents who want their children to enter a good university have their children study harder. Children who have those parents usually go to additional institutes after class. Those institutes where the children spend much time teach English Mathematics and Writing skill for essays. It is an obvious phenomenon which is widespread in Korea. However I don't think making their children study all day long is a good characteristic of ideal parent. On the other hand parents who don't care about their children's educational achievement are not also appropriate as ideal parent. Stimulating children's educational curiosity which makes children motivated to study is necessary to parents. Finally giving children opportunities to study English is one of significant factors to become good parents. In Korea many people who didn't have opportunities to study English in their childhood and just relied on the school's curriculums are struggling to improve their English skills which can affect their salary or job positions. Therefore I think those who give adequate educational care for their children are ideal parent.
