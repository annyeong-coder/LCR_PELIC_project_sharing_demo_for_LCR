I finished my major on June and the ceremony where the certificates are given to the students was last month on October. I should have found out what I could do if I was here in the U. S. And I should have informed to my family about this situation. The thing is that a friend of mine took my certificate when my name was called. That made me angry because it is something important for me and I wish I could have solved this problem because it is known that you can require to take the certificate several months later if you cannot assist that day. But it is not only my fail. For example my brother was in my University two months ago doing some paperwork and he was warned about the dates of this events so he could have told me what he knew. Instead of that he did it after everything had happened. Also my classmates in Spain might have sent an e mail before the ceremony not after. I think that the University ought not to have organized such a event without sending mails to the student's homes. In any case the principal mistake was mine because I shouldn't have forgotten that those kind of ceremonies usually take place a few months after the course is ended.
