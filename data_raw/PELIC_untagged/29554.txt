My favorite food is seafood. I like to cook slices of fish fillet and serve them with rice or vegetables . I also like make different dishes of shrimp . Seafood is healthy and light. When I eat it I don't feel full after finishing my lunch. For dinner I like to have some bread with honey or cream cheese and I have a one banana or orange . I eat my dinner before 9 00 pm so when I go to sleep I feel so light and healthy.
