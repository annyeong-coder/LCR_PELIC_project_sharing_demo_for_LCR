Is it a legal to download copyright material from the Internet or not There is a huge argument between people about downloading copyright material from the Internet in my opinion copyrighting material should be protected and illegal because a lot of people use the Internet to get the information and knowledge. And some people use Internet to watch movies or download music and software without paying and that is the issue for the copyright owner and make them lose a lot of money and effort.
