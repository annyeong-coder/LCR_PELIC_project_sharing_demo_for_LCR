I met my best friend SiDan while I was studying in Singapore. We met in the chinese classroom. She was talking to her friends while I was finding a seat. I sat next to her and she helped me a lot. After that we became the good friends. We went out together in festivals and we also enjoied many events. We had a lot of happy memories.
