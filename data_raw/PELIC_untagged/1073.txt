In last year I was spend a lot of money for something ales. For example comera home theatre cloth shose and some DVDs. But in this year I am very poor I am so regets. I shouldn't have to bought a DVD home theatre it is very expensive. I ought to saved the money then I can buy another thing. I think I bought too many cloth and shose. I could have spend those money. Last one I shouldn't have to wasted money to buy a lot of DVDS.
