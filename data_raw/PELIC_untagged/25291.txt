ANON_NAME_0 Last Name 3G May 25 2010 Honeymoon Seven years ago I got married. I was very happy and my wife was happy. After the married my wife and I went to Egypt. Egypt is beautiful. We liked it because it had many activities. Our schedule was accurate. Every day we woke up early at 8. 30Am and we ate breakfast. After the breakfast we did some exercises in the gym and we swam. My wife didn't know to swim but I taught her. She was very happy when she swims first time. Then we ate the diner quickly because after swimming we were very hungry. Usually we watch movie in the theater at 6. 25Am. The theater was in big mall. After watching we sit in coffee shop and talked together. Sometime I smoked hooka. This is tapako from Egypt.
