Air pollution is the biggest environmental problem in my home country. Most people do not care about the environment. They like to drive cars instead of riding bikes or walking. For the better and bigger houseing people destroy forests and burn many trees. Since my country is a developing country increasing the development of economy is crucial. There are many heavy industries which emit poison gases and pollute air in my country. Our governemnt need to strengthen management and enhance regulations before the situation get worse.
