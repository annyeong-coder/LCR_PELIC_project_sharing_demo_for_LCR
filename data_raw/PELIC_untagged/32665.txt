The quotes talk about a true friend is somebody who can make us do what we can I think this means that a good friend is can push us to do things and work hard together. It is not easy to make our self do what we don't like to do. I also agree this quotes a true friend is someone who can do a thing what we can't do. True friends are like a star that is shines in the sky whether they are bright or dim. My best friend Nancy in China was like that. Nancy whom I got along with She always help me when I felling bad at office hour. She was someone who I can share the secret with and she can keep the secret for me.
