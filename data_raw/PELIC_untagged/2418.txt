I want to tell you about my son Shawn whom I really love than anyone else. My son was born in Feb. 15 Just the day after Valentine's day. I had him in my belly for 10 months. I didn't realize that he was created in me at first but a few month later I had to be very cautious in everything. When he was born I couldn't say how much I was excited and very pleased to see him. I cried a lot when I first saw him. And now he is almost 2 year old and he always makes everything messy at home. However whenever I see him I feel happy and want to hold him tightly. His smile is gorgeous and I won't exchange him with any other things. I really love him as a mother. In addition loving my child is a good chance to realize how much my parents love me a lot. I will love him forever as my parents do to me. I love you Shawn.
