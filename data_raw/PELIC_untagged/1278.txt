I could save some money I think that money is an important element of my life. Many people want to succeed in their life but few people could make a hit. Like that Rome was not built in a day it takes long time to succeed in life. I want to explain about my experience. In 2001 I graduated from college and I got a job with KBS Korean Broadcasting System . When I received my first paycheck I spent all the money for me. I couldn't save any money. So I blamed myself. After then I decided to save money regularly. After one year I could save much money. In 2002 I resigned my work because I wanted to study more. So I went to Italy. I didn't have to borrow from my parents because I had enough money to study in Italy for one year. When I returned to Korea in 2003 I had taught children for one year and I could save money again. If I had not save money I couldn't have studied and made happy memories in Italy. I think that saving money is easier than making money. I want to feel an accomplishment by saving money. Now my husband and I have lived for one year in Pittsburgh because he has worked for UPMC since Jan. 2005. I'm studying in ELI and I don't work now. So we made a plan for our future. We paid retirement allowance medical insurance every month. Also we determined to save some money for our future. Success of life isn't a big thing. Although we can't make much money at once but we can save some money and I confirm that this money will be our nest egg.
