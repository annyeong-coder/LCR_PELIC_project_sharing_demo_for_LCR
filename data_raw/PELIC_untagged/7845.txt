When I was young my father made me learn how to swim. That was more than thirteen years ago. Because I was only 9 years old at that time I was afraid of swimming. But my coach taught me kindly from the beginning to the end and before long I got the skill of swimming. Since then I practiced swimming very hard and then I took part in a swimming contest which was held under the sponsorship of the city of Seoul. Finally I won the prize at that contest. I felt a lot of satisfaction and since then 1998 I've been swimming off and on for 10 years.
