One year ago I lent my friend Jerry ten thousand TWN dollars while he is studying abroad. After half year I have a dilemma to ask him to return. Of course Jerry shouldn't have forgotten to return my money. I shouldn't have taken a long time to ask him this thing. I could've written a lending note when he borrowed my money at that time. I just think that lending money to friends is not a very important event. Maybe I could've asked him forwardly.
