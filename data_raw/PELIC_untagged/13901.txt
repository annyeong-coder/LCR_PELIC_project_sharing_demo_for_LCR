I have had driver's license for thirteen years. I had been driving a car and studying a traffic signs before I took the driver's license test at my hometown. I had ever thought giving up because I knew No driver's license No driving. My parent had not allowed me to drive on the street until I got the license therefore I had to get one as soon as possible.
