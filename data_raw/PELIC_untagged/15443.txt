Comparing Myself with My Sister I would like to compare and contrast myself with my sister because we are coming from the same family. We have similarities as well as differences. First of all my sister's eye color is as dark as mine. Secondly she also has dark hair as mine too. Also we both have good skin. Thus we don't both mind that we are short. Finally we are both good dancers. Some other things that we think is we are different to each others are that she likes to read documentary and I like to read contemporary art literature and love stories. Also she is not afraid of snakes but I am defiantly afraid of snakes. However my sister and I come from the same family and we have same mother and father we are both unique we have similarities and differences and we respond to life using these attributes of ours. Finally we are two different human beings no matter how we have similarities and differences.
