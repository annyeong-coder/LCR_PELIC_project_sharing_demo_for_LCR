It is depend of the country. In my country you usually don't throw away something usable because first you probably don't have money to change it and second because we have a lot of poor people who need this usable things and you prefer give it to them. In this country is very normal to throw away items that you can use again. Probably the American people can buy everything they want and change everyday thier furniture or devices and they don't have a lot of space to keep this kind of things and they prefer throw away for who want or who need to use. For example people like me love this kind of culture because I can save money pick this things up Last year I found an air aconditioner and a desk in very good condotions and I use the air acondition in summer and study every day at this desk. It is possible if I didn't find this items I had needed to expend more than 200 dollars buying this items in the text Stephanei Erbes did the same like me because she save a lot of money when she pick up a lot of stuffs for the twins. Sometimes the people pick up thing that they don't need like the piano that kruger found or the cashmere sweaters that Marylyn found too this kind of things it is more for placer than for necesity I prefer to pick up things that I need for two reason first because I don't have space to have it and second because if you don't need it probably you don't use it.
