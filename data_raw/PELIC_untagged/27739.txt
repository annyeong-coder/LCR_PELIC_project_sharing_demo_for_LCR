It's very interesting to talk about your life Before I came US I didn't use to ride buses but I used to drive a car. Also my father used to give money but know I have to be independent. However in my country I used to go with my family every weekend and sometimes I used to be alone to treat some issues with my self. In addition When I was there I used to kiss my mother's head every morning but I can't now.
