Hi Sand. I appreciate you to send me a letter. I suggest that you should not quit a job at all. Please keep working and earning a lot of money. You might maintain your relationship with working. And you could visit your boyfriend's house once per one month. It sounds quite hard to you now but it had better for your relationship. Also you should make a hobby not to concentrate only your boyfriend. It could work for your relationship. Hope you guys to have a relationship well and happily.
