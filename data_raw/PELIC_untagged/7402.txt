My hometown is Taipei. It is the capital city of Taiwan. Taipei is a modern convenient and busy city. Taipei 101 the highest building of the world is located in Taipei. The transportation in Taipei is very convenient. We can take bus train airplane and MRT to anywhere we want to go. For example we can take bus or MRT to Tamsui and Shilin nightmarket to eat delicious food and visit old building. People who live in Taipei always very busy. Some people must work from 8AM to 10PM they have a lot of pressure from their works. Although that people still like to live in Taipei because it is a convenient and morden city in Taiwan.
