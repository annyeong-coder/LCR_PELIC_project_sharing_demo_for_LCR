I will introduce my self. Fist my hobby is watching baseball or playing baseball. These days I go to PNC park for watching Pirates playing with my brother. So they are worse team in major league so sometimes they disapointed us. But I am still cheering Pirates. Second I need to improve my Eglinsh speaking so I met conversation partner in last semester. And then we are keeping relationship until now. Today he went to my house and he is talking with my another Korean friend. And then he is going to sleep in my house. Lastly I have plan to go exchange students program in my university. That is why I came to Pittsburgh. If I want to go their I should get good points in TOFEL. But I didn't study a lot since I came here. Therefore yesterday I made a schedule to study English and I follow the schedule. Also I will keep the schedule until I go home.
