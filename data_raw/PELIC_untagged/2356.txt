As we know sleeping is very important for people to live since a good sleeping can bring us lots of energies. Every one has different considered for sleeping such as the quality of bed pajamas time environment or condition. Of course these are essential for me especially a good environment and condition of sleeping that are very important than others. I used to have a very good sleeping environment and condition before I came here. I used to live in a residential quarter where was quiet and surrounding a lot of trees. So I always went to bed around 1 pm and waked up early about 7 Am. Every day I felt so nice to get up with hearing birds' songs and chirps. It was grateful for beginning of a day. Compare to where I live now the environment and condition are not good enough because I live on a big street and near a hospital. I always can hear some noises during the midnight for example some alarm of ambulances or police cars and some sound by cars buses or trains passing. Thus even though I go to bed early every night I still feel sleeping most days. So I love sleeping a lot and it is indispensable to me for keeping life going. So during my sleeping it is considerable to have well environment and condition.
