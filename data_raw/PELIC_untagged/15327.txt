I would like to introduce my friend who is trouble maker. He is a normal student whose father is the owner of a gas station. One day When he helped his father he filled in volatile oil car with gasoline. He is the first person who did a ridiculous mistake. In addition he had a car accident when he saw a woman who wore a miniskirt. The bus which he hit was full of passengers at that time. However in spite of his careless we are the best friends.
