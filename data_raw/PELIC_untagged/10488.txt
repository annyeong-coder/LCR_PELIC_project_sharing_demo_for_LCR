Personal statement I graduated from Guangxi Medicine University in China and got M. D degree in 2003. Although it was my mother rather than my willing that I was conducted into the field of medicine after total 8 years training in this field I think nothing is more suitable for me than this profession. My mother think I am good at reciting and summarizing which has provided a strong basis to learn abundant and abstract medical knowledge most importantly she think I like to take care people. My mother was right. She perceived my potential trait I didn't know. Since I entered University I was easy to understand those dull and complicated medical theories which were reflected into my transcript. I got 3. 6 GPA and took the top 4 among estimated 700 students when I graduated. Due to my excellent academic performance I went into the next academic program empted from the entrance examination in Sep 2003. During 3 years I got M. S degree in Microbiology.
