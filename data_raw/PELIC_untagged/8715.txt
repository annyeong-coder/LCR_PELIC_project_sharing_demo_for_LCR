The percent of people who read the newspaper has changed a lot in the last 14 years. The graph indicates that many people have lost their reading habits and shows us many important decrease about people who read the newspaper from 1990 to 2004. In May 1990 70 percent of people used to read a newspaper. After two years in June 1992 there was a slow increase and the percent of newspaper readers were peak. Then the percents were decreasing slowly again . In the four years percents or readers were steady . About 71 people would read. But after 1998 there was a sudden decrease. According to the graph 63 percent of people would gave up reading a newspaper. Near 2004 the percent of people who read a newspaper were very low. I think that the percent of people who read a newspaper is associated with technology. Young people just aren't interested in reading a newspaper. They see they can read news without paying and when they connect with a computer they can select from literally thousands of information sources. Moreover their hands never get dirty from newsprint. However in my opinion it doesn't matter which way you read. You just should notice what is going on around your world.
