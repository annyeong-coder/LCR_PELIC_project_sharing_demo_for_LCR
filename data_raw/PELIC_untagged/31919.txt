I always went to the beach when I had bad emotions such as upset nervouse etc. I sat or lay down there for several hours then I made me calm down again. When I reached the beach I would take my shoes and socks off immediately. I love the feeling about touching warm and soft sands. Sometimes I lay down and covered myself with sands. It maked me feel very safe. I didn't focus on anything. I just felt the sunshine gentle breeze and smelt the salt water. Nothing came to my mind and everything were not significant anymore. I was happy and energitic again. Then I was going to do some interesting things. For example building a sand castle by myself assisting fisherman catching fishes or crabs jumping or swimming in the cool water looking for clams or starfishes etc. If it was evening I could see my favorate view the beautiful sunset. The sun like a big red ball fell down slowly and the sea's color changed to bronze. The light jumped with the wave. It was so awesome. So you can see the beach is a amazing place for me to relax myself.
