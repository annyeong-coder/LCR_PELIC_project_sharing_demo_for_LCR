The fantastic experience that I have had with money was with one of my friend who coordinated an activity with our classmates since five years. We were reluctant between two countries either Egypt or Dubie but we eliminated Egypt and decided to travel to Dubie and all of us agreed. At that time I had a new visa which I got it from my country and I thought I had enough money to share my friend in all the bills. What happened I was so nervous when I was in the airport and I gave the rent car agent the card to pay for the car but does not accessible because I did not activate the card. Also I did not find any ATM machine that accepted Saudi's bank card. I asked my friend to lend me a great deal of money to have fun and buy whatever I want. The good thing is my friend had a little extra money and he payed for me many times but I returned the money after arriving to Saudi Arabia. It was interesting experience that we were visiting a great many places such as Dubei tower international village and some shopping malls. I am biased toward Dubie that has much property and it has plenty of clients.
