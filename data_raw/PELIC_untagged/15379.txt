Feb 22 2009 Teresa My sister and I There is a friend whom I have been knowing in twenty five years. She is so close with me. We usually hang out and sleep together. If she has trouble I always love to help her. We take care of each other. She is my friend my little sister. We share many interests but there are differences in our appearance and personalities. On weekends we like to go mountain hiking. It's our common hobby. We like to breathe fresh air instead of dirty city air to sit on a bench to see view below us. Sometimes we go shopping together we like to give each other suggestions of outfit. I choose clothes for her then she chooses it for me. We even share clothes shoes and purses. Such as swimming my friends can't do this with me except my sister. It is because most of my friends can't swim. Even we have the same hobbies but there are differences in ours. In appearance both of us have straight noses and small mouths. Strangers feel we are sisters in these features. Even though we look similar she has double fold eyelids but I have single edged eyelids. She is chubby but I am not. Beside this her personality is introverted and mine is extroverted. I like to make friends but she prefers to be alone. That is the reason that she is independent and I am not so I always depend on her and my friends. Lots of things has happened to us. We have laughed together and have cried together. We have shared everything with each other. When she needs to be inspired I am there. If I need someone to talk she opens ears. We will go thought more and more things in the future. I believe we will have lots stories between us.
