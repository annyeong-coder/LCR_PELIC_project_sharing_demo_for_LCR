I'm in U. S. Now. So I have some plans here. I will trip to other cities in the U. S. I will be done the courses for lever 5 in ELI. I'm going to visit my best friend who lives in NYC. I might get a master degree in the University of the U. S. I could stay here about 5 years. I may go back to visit my family next year then come back to the U. S.
