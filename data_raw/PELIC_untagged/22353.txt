I ate breakfast at 9 this morning then I went to gym to do exercise. I love sports. I have been practiced swimming for 10 years. I went to swim after class when I was young. Also I have learned basketball. I played basketball in my free time when I studied in middle school. On the other hand I like dancing too. I have been studying dance for 2 years. I have studied new jazz one of the most popular dance.
