Some times my friends from my home country call me at 6 00am or earlier so I have to wake up to answer the phone some times I just hang up because I cant talk when I am tired some of them left a text message so I have to call them back I was asking my self how did I end up this situation I figured out the solve I have to talk every person and tell him the exact time to call me. That was not easy it took a long time because of the international calls some times are not good some times I have to hold on for 5 minutes or more but I didn't give up I found out it is easier to use the internet to contact my friends.
