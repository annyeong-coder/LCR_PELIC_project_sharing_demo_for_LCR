Disadvantages of using modern technology In my opinion there are three major disadvantages of using modern technology in our lives. First of all modern technology such as smart phones or laptops can weaken human relationship. By using text messages or messenger chat people will not interact with each other face to face. Second people start to rely more on technology and that makes them less self reliance. For example students these days rely on computer software to correct their spelling mistakes. Finally modern technology can be the main reason for wasting time for teenagers who play online games for a long time. In conclusion I believe that modern technology has bad effects.
