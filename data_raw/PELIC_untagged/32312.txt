Women are better parents than men. Women can spend longer time being with their children than men. For example during pregnancy and when mother feed their milk mother and children are connected with very strong and close relationship. Mothers mainly take care of their children thorough their childhood. When children grow up they can talk with their mothers about their school friends and so on closely and comfortably. The another point is that mothers are kind patient and calm generally speaking. Mother can be good teacher for their children. When children learn how to speak how to walk how to make friends or how to cook mother stay close to their children and if children fail to something mother can tell or show why they fail without anger. These are the reasons that I think women are better parents than men.
