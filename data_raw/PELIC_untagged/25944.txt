Hi I'm ANON_NAME_0 Last Name . I've been working on my profile for a while. I want it to be simple and interesting. I liked the way of using interent for making friends since it established. I've been making friends for years. I've graduated form a Saudi university. I got my B. A there. Before I came to US I had taught for a year in Saudi Arabi. I was teaching Enlgish for a while. I've lived in Buraydah most of my life. By 2010 I'd moved to Pittsburgh to study my master gegree. After I'd thought about Pittsburgh for a while I decided to come here. I have been studying Enlgish since I came to Pittsburgh. I think that I've chosen the right city and institute. The Eli had been teaching Enlgish since 1964. This long experince had given the Eli the best accrediation for years and I am sure that it deserves it.
