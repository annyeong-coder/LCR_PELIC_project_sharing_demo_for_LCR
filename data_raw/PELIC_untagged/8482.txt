There are many things I need to do in my living room at home. Fist of all I should hang up some pictures. Next I have to throw away the old chairs and pick out new ones. Then I need to leave on the air conditioner. After I should tear the wall up. In addition I need to light up my living room to make it bright. Next I have to take out all the trash from my living room. Then I should pick out a new coach. Finally I must touch up the paint.
