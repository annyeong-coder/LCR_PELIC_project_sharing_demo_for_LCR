As soon as you enter the bed room you can see the big window in front of you. So you realize it's very bright. It makes me comfortable. The door is located in the corner of the right wall and the left one so you can see the white wall which is no decorated as soon as you enter the room. The windows is on the next wall. There is an air conditioner below the window which is the hight of 1 meter from my chest and there is another window to the left of the door. You can see the drawer on facing the wall. My bed room looks simple because it is for just sleeping so I don't want to decorate it. My bed room is the simplest room in my apartment and the sun comes into the room during the daytime. I sometimes smell the sun from the linen when I go to bed which reminds me of my childhood. It makes me relax. For these reasons I can sleep well every night in my favorite bed room.
