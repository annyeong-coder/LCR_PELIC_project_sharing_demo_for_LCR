When I saw my new boss at first time I was working in my office. He was a busy man and he was walking around my department. So I missed a chance to introduce myself at first time. And I did that at the later conference. He gave us an appropriate advice always when we had a trouble. My new boss suggested going to abroad and introduced to me the laboratory of UPMC. So I am here in Pittsburg. He is an important person for me.
