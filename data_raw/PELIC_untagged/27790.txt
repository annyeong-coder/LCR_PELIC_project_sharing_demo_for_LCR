In the early morning today the sound of my phone's tone waked me up. It was 5 00am!. In fact I was sleepy so I couldn't see the number therefore I just hung up the call. A minute later the phone rang again but this time I came up with the idea that I can turn it off or put it on silent. After I did that I couldn't sleep because I started thinking over the call. Consequency I Figured out that the number was for my friend from Libya. I was so sorry that she didn't call me back. After that she sent me a massege and apolojized because she just found out that her call was too early.
