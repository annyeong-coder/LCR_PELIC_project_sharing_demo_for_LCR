Introducing myself I am studying at ELI to polish my English. I am taking two classes right now. I am living with my family in Pittsburgh. We are a small family my husband who works for UPMC our daughter who was born here and I. This is the second city for me to live in the U. S. . I was living in NYC before I came here. I love Pittsburgh. Although some people complain about the long winter of Pittsburgh the summer is so nice especially for people who love outdoor activities like me. I go camping kayaking biking hiking and swimming during the summer. The wonderful summer takes over the long winter. I really enjoy my life here.
