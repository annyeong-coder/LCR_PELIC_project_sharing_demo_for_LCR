Most people live very busily and they want junk food such as hot dogs ramen or hamburgers. According to the Longman dictionary of American English new 4th edition junk food means food that is not healthy because it has a lot of fat or sugar. Even though people know junk food is injurious to their health they enjoy eating it. In addition when junk food manufacturers advertise their products they point out only the good aspects of junk food. Junk food has the advantages of being quick and easy to prepare and eat but also has the disadvantages of being bad for one's health. Therefore junk food manufacturers should not be allowed to advertise their products to children. Junk food has evil influences on children's health because it has a lot of sugar or fat. Children are under a lot of pressure at school and with homework and they are busy just like adults. They have to study and do homework make the best use of their talents and play with their friends to build good relationships. As a result they want to eat junk food like adults. They do not think about their health but convenience. In addition it is delicious. Therefore many children prefer to eat junk food. However if children watch a new junk food which is advertised they will eat even more junk food. For example my son David likes to eat hamburgers hot dogs and ramen. As a result he gains weight and becomes a fat child. In spite of that he still asks for junk food. He does not think about his health. In addition when he sees a new advertisement for junk food he wants to eat the product advertised. As I mentioned before junk food has the advantages in that it is quick and easy to prepare and eat and delicious but also has the disadvantages in that it has a bad effect on one's health. Therefore junk food manufacturers should not be allowed to advertise their products to children.
