One of the worst nuclear disaster in history happened on 26April 1986 at the Cernobyl plant in Ukraine. The released radioactive fallout was 4 hundred times more than had been n Hiroshima. Large part Russia Ukraine Belarus and Europe were radioactively contaminated. The rate of thyroid cancer and other malign disease increased in the affected area. Pine forest turned brown and died after the disaster. Ground water and the Pripyat River was radioactively contaminated. All the population in a 30 km radius was evacuated. Interesting fact is that after evacuation wild nature returned to this region. Wild animals that have not seen for centuries have returned to this region. For example Lynx Wild Boar Brown Bear Bison and Przewalski's horse now are seen in this region.
