One day something funny happened. What happened was I wore my pant wrong round and I didn't discover. At first I thought that my wearing looked like normal. Then I went to my school my classmate looked my pant and said Wilson you wore your pant wrong round. I didn't believe what he said at beginning. However after a second what I heard was that my other classmates were laughing. Then I realized that my pant was wrong way wrong. It was really embarrassing. How this happened is something that I didn't take care whether I wore my pant in correct round because I did it everyday and it had to be no problem. After I had this experience I check if I wear my pant correct round everyday.
