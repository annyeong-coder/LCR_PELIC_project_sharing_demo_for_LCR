There are many similarities in the two articles. First of all both of them are discussing the the small is the new big trend which means people are partial towards living in small houses. Second both of the writers support their idea by using examples by interviewing people who lives in small places and by showing their experience. Third the writers are showing a positive reaction to the idea of living in small places. Finally the two articles are of the same length. However there are many differences between the two articles. There were four people interviewed in the first article while in second article was specific only to one person. In my opinion the first article is more organized. On the other hand the writer of the second article tend to use dense sentences full of information.
