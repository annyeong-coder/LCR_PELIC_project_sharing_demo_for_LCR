In 2006 I was a student in high school. I had five close friends who never live without them. Now I can not communicate with them. I should have continued to contact with them. We had very fun with them in the school as I remember. We always tried to escape from the school also we made crazy our teacher. Now I regret. I should not have been a mischievous student. I really miss my younger life. I have many memories about school life this is the worst thing. One day I had a literature quiz which was very important for my school's future. Also I ought not to have missed my exam. When the quiz started the school's headmaster announced me. I went to his room and he gave me some piece of paper which was written that you had punishment for 3 days. I thought he might have talked to me about the problem before he gave the letter but he did not. Then I decide not to go to the school anymore. I ought not to have made this mistake. I should have continued my school. After 2 days from the occasion he called me and said that he made a mistake. He might have excused also he could have called my family because they felt more embarrassed than me. He caused to amend my school and speared my best friends. I never forget him and I still do not understand to what the wrong was!
