My life in America is nice but when I need to hang up the phone is hard to me. I try to find out best form to talk or listening. Most of time I try to figure out what people saying. I can't understanding. If I need to call back is terible either people not understand me in phone. If someone near to me talk in english I just ask a person to hold on in phone and I give up the phone for another person. I always think over how so hard to talk in phone. I don't have choose I keep on with my courage pick up the phone and try to understanding something.
