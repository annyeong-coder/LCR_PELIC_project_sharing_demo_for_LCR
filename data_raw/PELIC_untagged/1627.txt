My personal success was during my work experiences. I used to work in a bank my duty was handling customers' arguments and finding anything about the other department's problems. Then suggesting to them how to improve. Most times we solved customer's arguments. Sometimes customers argued something that wasn't our fault but we needed to try to soften their bad emotion. Sometimes their arguments came from our bank's fault. At that time we needed to do three things. First I expressed my apology to the customer. Second I needed to find the primary cause and a solution. Finally I called customer again and told them what we did and said thanks for their arguments or suggests. I was proud of myself that I can do my job well.
