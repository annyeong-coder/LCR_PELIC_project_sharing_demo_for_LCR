German Proverb said Friendship is a plant which we must often water. Almost everyone knows that plants all require water. They might need different amount of water. I think that friendship is a relationship that emphasizes sharing your innermost feeling. It usually needs to take care a feeling which is happy or sad between you and your friend. Friendship looks like a fresh plant which needs you to look after it everyday. How do you cultivate and develop your friendship I have a best friend who is a good teacher works in my country. Six years ago I met her in my office when she just began to join our team. Soon we ware good friends. Maybe we had same personalities that I preferred to talk someone whether s he is a male or a female I could get a friend she could talk into strangers in a party or in a meeting then she got some friends quickly. We often shared our feeling of excitation or worry. For example I had health trouble when I was feeling down. She spent a lot of time to see a doctor with me. When I was treated by a hospital she always saw me at the hospital which was so far from her home in her free time and I really thanked her. I also knew that progressing friendship is each other. One day I saw her very annoying I asked her why she was sad. She told me that her son got a sick at their house alone nobody took care for him. She had a whole day's classes and couldn't stay home. I quickly checked my schedule and just had one class then told her not to worry. After my class I went her home with her son. Today we often call each other on the phone.
