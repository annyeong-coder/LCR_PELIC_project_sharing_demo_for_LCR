Driving age The minimum driving age in the United States law is 16 year old. Many people think that a young man have right to drive a car. However between 1995 and 2004 there were 30 917 fatalities in accidents that involved 15 to 17 year old drivers according to a study by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety Alex 2006 . This is the reason why I was opposed to the minimum driving age law . In my opinion I do not think a 16 year old teenager is mature and responsible enough to make good driving decisions. Driving a car have more responsibility than drinking alcohol. As a result driving age should close to drinking age driving age should be raised. Most of countries restricted driving age higher than the United States. It is crucial that this law in the United States should be changed.
