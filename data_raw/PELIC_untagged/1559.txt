Witing 3F Personal Success One of the things that I have been successful at is composing music on the computer. About three years ago I wanted to compose but my parent opposed it. However I wanted to a compose. First I searched the Internet and read books about composing. At that time the situation was very difficult because nobody taught me. So I was very sad. Later I worked using a composing program. I made a short melody. It sounded very good. I used the computer and made a melody so I was happy. Anyway now I can compose using this program.
