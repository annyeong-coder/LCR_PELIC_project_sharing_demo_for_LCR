My favorite Arabian myth is the story of Zelda. Zelda was a brave legendary woman who lived in an small island. She was a witch who had a great strength. The story of Zelda is probably considered the most famous Arabian myth. The story began when Zelda was 10 years old. She was playing in the Heruly arena when she felt down to sharp stone as a reaction of this she transfered the stone to flower by accident after that point zelda discovered her new talents which is the magic of transformation. One day there was an evil man called ganondorf attack Zelda's island and he will destroy all the city but our hero Zelda stopped him and transfere him to a statue which is still exist in shalashaska desert.
