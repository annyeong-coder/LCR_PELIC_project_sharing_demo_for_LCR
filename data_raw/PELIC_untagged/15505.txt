I was a product supervisor in a large computer company ten years ago and I was working along with two colleagues. Their names were ANON_NAME_0 and ANON_NAME_1. My boss asked me to recommend one of them to be a manager of an accounting department. Soon after that I started to analyze the differences and similarities between them so I decided to recommend ANON_NAME_1. They had several similarities that made it difficult to differentiate between them. First of all both had Master's degrees in accounting from United States. ANON_NAME_0 was as responsible as ANON_NAME_1. They did their tasks in high accuracy and they finished them on time. Thus any boss would be satisfied with their deeds. I made the decision after I looked at the differences. While ANON_NAME_1 had 12 years experience ANON_NAME_0 had 6 years experience. Also ANON_NAME_1 was good at communication with people as well as his colleagues but ANON_NAME_0 had less communication skills . ANON_NAME_1 was organized and a hard worker. He arranged everything in his daily life. In contrast ANON_NAME_0 was less organized. He scattered papers everywhere in his office but he was a hard worker. To sum up after I evaluated these differences and similarities I had the right decision. This position needs someone who is competent and honest. Therefore I chose ANON_NAME_1 to be an accounting manager and I sent a report to my boss. In fact ANON_NAME_1 deserved it because of his skills and responsibility.
