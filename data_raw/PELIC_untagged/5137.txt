He is right because if you choose this way to know people you need to do all of this things to try to found someone who you want and the only way to do this is follow his recomendations however I think this is a little risky because you need to trusy in someone who you don't know s heis. The most valuable recomendation is don't tell lttle white lies because you need to the other person trust in you an d if you start a relationship with lies probably you can fail this oportunity and know one diserve this kind of lies. I don't think is valuable do spend time getting to know someone it is very diffucult to know someone only by internet and spend a lot of time writing and writing its not enough I think you try to met this person as soon as posible an then you can spend more time to talk or share other things like hobbies experiences etc.
