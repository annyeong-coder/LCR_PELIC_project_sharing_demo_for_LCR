When I was 25 years old I met my girlfriend who is important to me. We went to the same University in Korea. And we are same major field. I saw her at first in a bus. I realized my purse was lost when I took a bus. I really embarrassed that time. Because I didn't have any money I couldn't pay the money. At the moment someone give me the money. She was my classmate. I was grateful that she helped me. So I suggested to have dinner together. We had a great time while we were having dinner. Since then I became much closer with my girlfriend and we have something that stuck us together. The memory that happened that day is such an unforgettable memory in my life.
