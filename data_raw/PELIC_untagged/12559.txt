Tom Higgins' restaurant has some problems. Especially he doesn't have business strategies. In my perspective he should find the good strategies to solve Undergrad Grill Restaurant's problems. Tom needs to modify many things in the restaurant for his success. First Tom needs to have more advertisements his restaurant. Advertising helps more people know Undergrad Grill Restaurant how different with other restaurant in the Benson University. Second Tom needs to hire professional chef. Tim and chef need to discuss about the especial menu. If Undergrad Grill Restaurant supplies delicious foods to attract customers many people visit his restaurant. That time he makes event to customer. It helps to attract many people in his restaurant. Finally Tom needs to hire more waitresses and educate them how to service customers. Attitude and quality of the best service is very important to restaurant. Trying more ways to change and refer other success restaurant's mangers. I hope the restaurant becomes more successful and popular in Benson University and Tom achieves his success.
