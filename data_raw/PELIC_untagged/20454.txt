I got my state ID Identification card last week. Before I got my ID card I had been preparing I 20 two proofs and my passport. First I went to social security office. When I arrived there most people in social security office were waiting. After I received social security number I left for the building that issue state ID card. When I acquired temporary ID card from the building it had been raining luckily. Even though my friend had already made it he helped me. It was very valuable day.
