Last Saturday was importance for me because I improved my human relationship in last Saturday. I got up 11 00 A. M. I washed hair and face. I made a dumpling soup for brunch. When I finished my brunch my girl friend was coming my house. Last Saturday I had an brink appointment with my classmate and Taiwan friend. I went to giant eagle because I didn't have enough food 1 00 P. M. I buy the fruits and the snacks. I came to house 3 00 P. M. I prepared food with my girl friend and roommate. I cooked corn soup with roommate. My girl friend cooked noodles with bean sauce. We finished food at 5 00P. M. My friends came to my house at 5 30P. M. Actually they are my first visitors in my house so I was worry about them. They bought beer cans and wines. We talked that we can't talk easily ordinary times. Actually my drinking capacity is very week. But that time was very funny and comfortable. We could make more closely each others. We talked about Korea culture and Taiwan culture. Something is stranger for me. But soon I and Korea friends could understand about Taiwan culture and Taiwan friends also could understand about Korea culture. We drunk alcoholic drink until 5 30A. M. I was tired but I think last weekend is value
