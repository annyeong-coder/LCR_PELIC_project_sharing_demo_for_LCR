One may like Mr. Muggeridge sometimes wryly observe that the number of Prime Ministers seems to increase in direct proportion as the number of territories directly subject to Her Majesty declines. 190 The proportions between the mean and these z values are 0. 4732 And 0. 2734 Respectively. The proportion between z 1 and z 2 is therefore 0. 4732 0. 2734 0. 1998. This is the same as the proportion between z 1 1. 93 And z 2 0. 75 Since the curve is symmetrical.
