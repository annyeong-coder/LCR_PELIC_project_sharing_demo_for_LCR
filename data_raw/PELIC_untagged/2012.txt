Before I came to Pittsburgh I'd been afraid of a lot of things because in Japan we often watch news on TV about crimes or accidents that happened in the U. S. So I thought I might be shot or stabbed after I started to live in the U. S. Also I thought our flight from Japan to the U. S. Might be hijacked by terrorists. Additionally I thought I wouldn't survive there because I couldn't speak and listen to English well. However America is much safer than I thought. Having a gun is illegal in Japan so shootings rarely happen there. Maybe it happens when Japanese gang war breaks out. At first I was so scared even if I only heard about news on a shooting but now this may be inappropriate to say though I've gotten used to hearing the news. When my husband was given a blow to the head in Oakland last year I got frightened. A man who smashed my husband was walking over hitting people at random and arrested. My husband's left temple was swollen a lot and he got shocked. But I haven't still been nervous about the safety in the U. S. Since it happened because I know it's possible this also happens in Japan. Also I flew by plane seven times in the U. S. And fortunately nothing happened. Now I'm not so afraid of hijacks either. Sadly my English has still problems so when I talked to English native speakers I still get tense and nervous. But maybe this problem won't cause death to me so I don't have to be worried much about something bad happening to me because of my poor English. However now I hope my English will improve more. I expect I'll be able to speak and listen to English better. And then I think I'll be able to enjoy talking to English native speakers if I study English consistently. I hope so.
