CLASS Writing Level 3 G Activity 3 30 Second draft Oct 16 2006 Dear Falah I recently went to see some laptops because I want buy one. I saw different laptops from different companies. The best of them were two Laptops. One of them was from Sony Company and another one was from Toshiba Company. Both have good options but I prefer Sony more than Toshiba for four reasons. First of all Sony's laptop has 2. 2 Internet speed but the Toshiba's laptop has 1. 6. Second Sony's laptop memory is more than Toshiba's laptop memory. In addition I liked Sony's laptop color it was gray but Toshiba's laptop was black Sony's laptop was wonderful. Finally Toshiba's laptop is heavier than the Sony's laptop. What you think it is the best Give me your advice. Sincerely
