Applying For A Job This is really great opportunity and I really want to work at this office. This job is good for me because I take responsibility and have experiences for this job. I have taken responsibility for my job in the past. I worked at a pharmacy for 5 years. Sometimes I had to work at late because our work did not finish. Some people wanted to go home soon but I don't want to go home until I finish my work. I am responsible for my job because I think if people don't take responsible for their job they lost their job. I have experiences for this job. I also studied about supplements while working. I gained a lot of knowledge by working at a pharmacy. For example some elder people often came to the pharmacy because they want someone to listen to them. I like to talk with people and love to think about health together. Many people who have more experience than me may want to acquire this job. They might be able to speak English better than me but I have strong desire and more experience than them. I think would work at this job very hard. This job offer is very good opportunity for me because I have experiences and I take responsibility for my work.
