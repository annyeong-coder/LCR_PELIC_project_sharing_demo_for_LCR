The worst meal experience I have ever had was in Israel. We decided to have our dinner in Chinese restaurant. The restaurant was empty but this fact did not help us realise that we chose a wrong place. The menu was filled with items we were familiar with but when we ordered no one could eat them. Meals with meat tasted like some kind of vegetable dominant in the meal. Rice was not cooked well and vegetarian meals were too salty. My only hope a cup of tea tasted like hot water. When we came out of the restaurant we were still hungry. Fortunately we discovered a nice steak restaurant near to that Chinese restaurant and the day ended happily.
