Dear editor 1 month ago you your newspaper have published a DVD about Islam. The DVD discussed things that completely unrelated to this noble religion. When I watched the DVD I realized that you must have a misconception that you mixed between the teaches of Islam and the people who claim that what they say is from the core of Islam. Killing innocent people in the name of Allah God has never a part of Islam. They claim that this is the path for the heaven and Allah says in the holy Quran If somebody killed someone he would be as if he killed all people but if somebody saved one life it would as if he saved the life of the entire world. Allah says the biggest sin one might make is killing somebody for no reason! In one hand I would like to inform you that those people you showed in your DVD do exist in this life and have these believes. On the other hand they don't represent the real image of Islam and there is no muslim in the entire islamic world supporting them. Those people are ruining the islam teaches and they unfortunately found some source of media that publish their ideas all around the world. If want to see the real Islam you should visit a country that represent the real Islam like Saudi Arabia. You can have a closer view about the question you need an answer for. You can visit web sites as well. Thank you ANON_NAME_0
