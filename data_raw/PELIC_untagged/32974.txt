While I was staying in home yesterday I was eating nuts. After that I went with my friends to Indian restaurant. When we got to the restaurant we had our dinner . While I was eating my dinner my mother called me . After that we went to the cinema . While I was watching the dictator movie my friends were watching other movie . When I came back to my home I watched television . While I was watching television I was sleeping . While I am sleeping I was thinking the home works of the Institute. I woke up and I did my home works .
