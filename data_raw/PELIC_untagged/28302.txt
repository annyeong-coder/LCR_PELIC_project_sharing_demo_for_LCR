There is something different about my family in the last few years. When I was a high school student my parents take me to moved in Australian. Before we have moved Australian we have visited Australian twice when I was child. Australian it is a beautiful amazing country. In Sydney there are a lots of Chinese people to live. Last month I was feeling upset ever if I was lived with my parents. Now They have lived in China since 2009. It also had fun in Sydney. Last 2 month I came in U. S to continue study . They have decided to travel between Pittsburgh and LA in next year.
