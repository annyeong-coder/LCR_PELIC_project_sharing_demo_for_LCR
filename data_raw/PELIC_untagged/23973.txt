Difference between a buddy and a friend Most people can distinguish the contrast between a friend and a buddy however I do. A friend is someone who hangs out with you everytime. On the other a buddy is someone who hangs out with you and your friend sometimes. A buddy is someone whom we can not trust that much because he she hangs out with many differents people at the same time. A buddy whose job is to spy is not a good bubby. A friend is someone that is compatible with you. A Friend is also someome that is accepted as a member of your family. To conclude that there is not big difference between them but just a little chasm.
