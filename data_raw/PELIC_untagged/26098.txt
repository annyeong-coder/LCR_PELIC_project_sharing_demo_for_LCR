On The Sea There are many places in my city I liked to go to when I fell nervous but I liked one place because this place it has a calm atmosphere beautiful views and is free of people. When I went to this place and hear the sea waves I forgot everything in the world. Also I looked right or left trees surrounded me from everywhere. So I looked up the sky I saw the moon and a stars or sunrise or sunset depending on the time but sometimes there clouds. When I annoyed or huffy of my wife or family or work I prefer to go there.
