In the past few months since I came here to the U. S I found out that there are only two restaurants I like which is the Chinese Panda and the K. F. C restaurants. I knew I had a difficult decision to make when I felt hungry. Although I had talked to friends and my girlfriend who had eaten in both restaurants and visited often I couldn't decide because they were both the same. It was only after I compared the location cost and quality of food the two restaurants that I could finally come to my decision to eat at the Chinese Panda restaurant. The first thing I considered was the location. First of all both restaurants are located in Irwin where I am staying. But that is where the similarities end. The Chinese restaurant is twenty minutes away from my house. However the K. F. C restaurant is fifteen minutes in distance to walk. Even though the Kentucky fry chicken is closer logically safety is crucial when it comes up in my evaluation according to a position. The Chinese is setting in a safe suburb is definitely more secure than K. F. C location in a dangerous traffic on the main road.
