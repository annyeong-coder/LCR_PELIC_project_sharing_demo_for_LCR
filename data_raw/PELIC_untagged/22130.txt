I had never forget the day my new year spring festival. The chinese new year is now popular known as the spring festival because it starts from the beginning of spring. The day and Christmas Day are similar. In that day all family members get together celebrate the day. Waking up on New Year first they extend greetings to their parents then each child will get money as a New Year gift in red paper. People will eat dumplings that traditional spring festival food. The Spring Festival are a good time for relatives friends and classmates as well as colleagues to exchange greetings gifts and chat leisurely.
