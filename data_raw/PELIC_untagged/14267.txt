My Favorite Food My favorite food is Lahmacun. And it's made of dough ground beef parsley and special spicies. Its shape looks like a pizza but its taste is different. Unlike a pizza Lahmacun is rolled after you put some salad in it. However before rolling the dough we squeeze lemon on it. Lahmacun is a traditional food of southern part of Turkey. As is most of the food in that part of Turkey it is also hot and spicy. Just as I love Lahmacun Most of the people love and eat that food in Turkey.
