Germany is a small country located in the heart of Europe has many geographical features and well known for its history of beer brewing. In the northern part of the country the whole area is flat. In the south there are many mountains and the highest one called Zugspitze is located in the Bavarian Alps. Germany's biggest river the Rhein flows from the south to the north. Every region has a different style and rich tradition of beer making. There is a common stereotype that Germans drink beer and eat sausages all the time. However my German classmate Nicole said It's not true that Germans drink beer all the time. There is a time of a year called Oktoberfest when everyone is celebrating good harvest. During this celebration Germans drinking a lot of beer and eating special white sausages.
