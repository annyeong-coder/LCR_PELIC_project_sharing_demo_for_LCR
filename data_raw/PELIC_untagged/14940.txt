Hello everybody! My name is Ariel Last Name and I am from Taiwan. Information Communication that is kind of designer is my major. Now I am studying English in ELI and planning on taking my master degree in America. I love to watch movies go travelling and read novels. Every day I watch one movie for practicing listening and pronunciation that it's really useful. In addition I also enjoy going to the library in the morning every day. Besides I like to join group activities that I never try it. Moreover I made many new friends when I participated to the activities.
