Hi Friend I hope that you will like the ELI. It is very interesting institute. If you are planning to study in the ELI you should be ready to study hard. If you don't to be a full time student you can take three or four classes. ANON_NAME_0 Davies is the student's advisor that the student can go to her if they need help. You can go to Forbes Ave if you want to eat lunch. Also there is a dormitory near the ELI if you want a room near the Cathedral of Learning. The weather is very changeable in Pittsburgh. You have to be prepared for the cold if you plan to be in the ELI in the winter season.
