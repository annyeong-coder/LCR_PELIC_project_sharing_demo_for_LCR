I used to live in Riyadh. I attended Alalamiah Institute. In those days I used to have nice car. I used to drive to school everyday. I didn't use to take buses. I used to wear glasses in computer labs. I never used to speak English. Today I'm living in Pittsburgh PA and studying English program at University of Pittsburgh. I'm taking a bus to school everyday. I'm not wearing glasses in classes. I'm speaking English with people everywhere.
