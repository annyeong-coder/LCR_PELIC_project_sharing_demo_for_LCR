I used to play football when I was teenager . My best friend was a good player so he taught me play well. He made me did a lot of practice every day . And he did not let me smoke. Before any match began he told me you have to play as well as you can If we won he lat me go home early. But next day he had me worked hard . Before any match he encouraged me to do my best so he got me did well. Just now I know why he helped me did all that.
