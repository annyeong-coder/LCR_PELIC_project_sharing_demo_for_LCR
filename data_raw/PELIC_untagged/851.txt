Writing 3F Personal Letter Oct 16 2006 Dear Mom Mom. I want to have a Mp3 player because I would like to listen to music and English listening. I compared both iriver and iPod. Both Mp3 players have photo text video functions but they have many different things. I think the iriver is better than the iPod first because the iriver is easier to use than iPod. This is because iriver includes a description book but iPod doesn't have a description book. Second the iriver's battery time is longer than the iPod's. The iriver battery time is 50hours but the iPod is 16hours. Third the iriver includes FM radio and voice recorder but the iPod doesn't have this function. I need a FM radio because when I am bored I want to listen to the radio. I also need a voice recorder for when I practice English pronunciation. Finally the iriver repair service is free but the iPod repair service is very expensive. So I want to have an iriver. I believe you will buy it for me. Love
