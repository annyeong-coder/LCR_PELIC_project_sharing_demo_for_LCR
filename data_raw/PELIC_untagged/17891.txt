October 27. I've been on the Canary Island for three days now. I'll start home when the weather is better. I was so surprised when I picked up my mails today. My family sent some birthday presents to me. My Birthday is the 31st. October October 29. I think the weather is getting worse. I heard thunders today but there wasn't many much rain. Typhoon and I stared in bed on the bed . I stared reading brave New World Brave New World October30. I left the Canary Islands today just like Columbus Columbus and plenty of sunshine now. I went 250 miles. October 31. I'm 21 today. To celebrate I drank little a little coffee for breakfast and I opened my presents I got some jewelries. November 1. The electricities electricity are is low. I'd better save them until I get near land need . I'll need the radio then. It rained today so I collected a few some waters for cooking.
