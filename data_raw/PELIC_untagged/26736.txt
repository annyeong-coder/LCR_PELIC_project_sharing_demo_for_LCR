I used to live in Riyadh with my family I graduated from school of pharmacy in King ANON_NAME_0 University in 2007. I worked in Najran as teacher assistance in Najran University. While I was working in Najran I visited my parents monthly in Riyadh. In the past I used to eat dinner with my family and my wife cooked dinner and washed clothes for me. Today I am living in Pittsburgh and I am studying English in ELI. I live alone without family so I cook dinner clean the apartment and wash my clothes by my self.
