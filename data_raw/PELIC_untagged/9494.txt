I'm going to talk about my favorate actor. Nicolas Cage. He is known as one of the most famous movie actors in U. S and many of his movies are considered as world classics such as the Rock Con Air Face Off and the lord of war . Especially I was deeply touched by his film leaving Las Vages which also helped him won an Oscar. He has a genius of modeling charaters who have totally different personalities. Besides those heroical ones most of his charaters are rooted from real persons. By the way it is said that he is going to be a director.
