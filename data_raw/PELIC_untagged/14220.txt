German proverb says that friendship is a plant which we must often water. I really agree with this proverb. I haven't had my best friend since I lost my best friend a few years ago. My best friend was Minji who was one of my classmates when I was a high school student. Our school was located in Daegu which is the fourth biggest city in Korea. We had the same hobby which was collecting postcards. She was the person who sometimes sent a postcard to me. She was the person who studied with me went to movies with me and went to a hair salon with me in high school days. She was really a kind of person who listened to my private feelings and thoughts. Even after we graduated from the high school we were still best friends to each other for a long time. We entered to the different universities which were far from each other in Daegu. She was the person who often came to my university to meet me. After graduating from the university I entered a company which was located in Seoul. She decided to come to the U. S. To study English. I made my boyfriend and she also made her boyfriend who was a Christian. She was Buddhist but she was the person who changed her religion because of her boyfriend. I couldn't understand her about that. I thought she changed after she met her boyfriend. We were estranged each other. I have missed her so much since I lost her. If I can meet her again I'll try to water our friendship everyday.
