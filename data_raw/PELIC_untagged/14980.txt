Three years ago I met my boyfriend father while I was working in a coffee shop. He was our regular customers. One Christmas he introduced his son James to me while his son came back during the winter break. Few months later we had having a first dating when James had a summer break. We had a regular dating went to movie and had dinner together. Someday in last year we were having a big fight when I found out he was smoke. After the fight he promised to quit smoking so we kept our relationship. Last summer we were travelling to Taiwan for ten days. In the first few days we spent much money in buying trinkets and eating. However we discovered we went out all of the money in the last few days and both of us hadn't any credit card. Luckily we took few travel check with us but not every bank can trade it in Taiwan. Finally we found out a bank which issued the travel check and traded our checks. We fight a lot after we came to America. One day we were fighting at 3am. When the fight ended I was running away from home. I think that is an important relationship for me even we always having fighting.
