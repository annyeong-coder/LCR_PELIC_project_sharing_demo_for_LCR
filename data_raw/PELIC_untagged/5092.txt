One of my hobbies is playing golf. I have been playing it for one year and two months. My coworker forced me to do it when I worked as a medical doctor in Japan. That was the start of my golf life. I am by nature very weak in sports. So I started unwillingly at first. But I practiced harder it became interesting for me. Incredibly I have been to golf courses more than fifteen times in U. S. Since last April. Lately I have been doing it twice or three times a week. Furthermore I could make lots of good communications through it. That's why I like it .
