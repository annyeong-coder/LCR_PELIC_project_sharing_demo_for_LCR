I have the worst experience I have drunk. I found some soda. I think it would be better I found some pop in Giant Eagle. That name is Dr. Pepper. I took a gulp of the pop. I was surprised. Because it smells like a medicine for cold. Moreover I bought a grain of rice and Wing in Giant Eagle. Because American people eat Wing usual. I would like to try to eat it. It was so hard to eat. I could not chew it. And then I had a cup of water. The last worst meal experience I have had is Cake. When I saw cake in America I thought it looks like a Sesame Street color. I tried to eat a piece of cake one day. It was so sweet for me. But some cake that is sold in Whole Foods is not too sweet.
