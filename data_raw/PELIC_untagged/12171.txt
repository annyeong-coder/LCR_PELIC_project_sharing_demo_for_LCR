When film photography was used in astronomy observations typically found more blue galaxies than red ones. This was not because blue galaxies are actually more common but rather because photographic film was more sensitive to blue light than red light. With the conversion of astronomy to digital cameras which are more sensitive to red light than blue the opposite bias is now the case. Def an opinion about whether a person group or idea is good or bad which influences how you deal with it.
