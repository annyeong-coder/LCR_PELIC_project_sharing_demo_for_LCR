When I visited my wife in US in January 2005 we had a car accident. Before we set out from State College of Pennsylvania to Niagara Falls of New York our car was carefully checked in case something unexpected would happen. So our car was expected to be in good condition for a long distance trip. Generally we were supposed to be ready for any weather condition but we did nothing because it was the first time we had such a long drive. We were so happy that we forgot to take a look at the weather condition along the route. When we were driving on the express way very close to Buffalo and immediately after we were told to take care because of lake side effect our wind shield glass was covered a thick layer of snow in a very short time and wind shield wiper was blocked by quickly frozen snow. So anything could not be seen through our car window. Suddenly our car was hit back by a truck. Then our car was out of control and rushed onto the iron net. I found the car door could not be opened inside after I tried many times. Fifteen minutes later My wife and I were taken out from our car by a emergency rescue team. We felt very lucky because we just got some skin scratches.
