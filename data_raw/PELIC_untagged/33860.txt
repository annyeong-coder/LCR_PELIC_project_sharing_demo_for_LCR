Beyond the Rust Belt This reading is talking about the Rust Belt which were northern American cities. Due to lack of jobs Youngstown citizens started living and working somewhere else leading to a decrease in its population. As a result of de industrialization Detroit became distinctive from others as the murder capital of American cities. Despite being one of the Rust Belt cities Pittsburgh created new educational and health jobs as another step to re invent itself. Furthermore it began its green development program and promoted eco friendly architecture. However there are still problems on the surface and Pittsburgh's population continues to decrease.

As a result of Pittsburgh's success the key for Rust Belt cities to succeed is to follow Pittsburgh as a model by creating a variety of recreational cultural and entertainment activities.
