Now I'm being interested in Sidney Patrick Crosby. He is a phenomenon hockey player. He has belonged to the Pittsburgh Penguins. He was born on August seventh in 1987 in Canada. His father used to be a hockey player so he started playing hokey when he was 2 years old. He grew a super player he gained lots of points on each games. On the other hands the Penguins had struggled to win games for long time. They became the weakest team in 2004 2005. The team's owner was considering selling the team but he didn't. Because Crosby participated in the Penguins since 2005 when he was 17 years old yet. After that the team was going to be better. Last season he got MVP and he was selected the youngest team captain. This season He leaded the team to Stanly Cup. In addition he renewed the contract that he plays in the team for 5 years with the Penguins. According to an article the contract says that he gains 48 500 000 dollars per year. Thus His talent is perceived by everyone. I think that he will achieve a great objective someday.
