My first job was to be an announcer in the supermarket after I graduate. On my first day I felt a little nervous so that I made so much mistakes. For instance I announced some wrong prices of products and I lost an important notice to announce. After that manager warned me very seriously. I got a bad day in my first work day. One week later I did a good job in my position because a wonderful thing happened that was unexpected. I remembered that day was Friday and our supermarket would sell a new food toasted duck but the manager had no idea how to let customers know how good it was. When I heard about his problem I opened my mind as quickly as I could. Finally I told manager my way that if we could tell customers a traditional stroy like making toasted duck the customer would know our new food toasted duck a little bit. My manager thought about it and used my way later. Then it worked those toast duck sold out in 4 hours. I was very happy that day and I also made my manager's day. But I just quit this job after 30 days because I thought announcer was job but not career.
