Unfortunately economy has been affected this problem for a long time most Korean get jobs hardly therefore jobless are increasing. There are two solutions for this problem First of all the government has to help them. The government should make some classes or organizations to educate people. Make classes and educate them some professional and specific skills. Also the government should make more jobs. People always want to work in popular place and people just overcrowd some places where they like to work. The government could establish new laws for work to let people work as much as possible. Second most Korean should change their perspectives. Most Korean want to work in a good condition like a high income. A person whose income is not good she will change her job. Most people overcrowd some specific places and this affect jobless. People should learn that the high income is not the best way to be happy. Although you can not earn a lot of money you can find a special your own goal from your job. If people change their perspective they will be happier.
