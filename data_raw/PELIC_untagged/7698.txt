I met my husband while I was studying in the high school . The first time I saw him I was swimming on the beach . Then we went out to have dinner . While we were eating we decided to get married . Then we got married in 2006 when he graduated from the university . Then after we got married we had a scholarship to the United State . Then we started to preapare our visa when I was a student at an english institute . After that we decided to come to the U. S. A . Then we came and started to study in the ELI immediately while we were looking for an apartment .
