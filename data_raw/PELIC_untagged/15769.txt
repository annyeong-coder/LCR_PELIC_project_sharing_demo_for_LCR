The soccer players David Beckham and Ryan Giggs are some of the best player in the world. Both Beckham and Giggs play as a winger. Giggs' dribbling is better but he kicks less delicately than Beckham. Beckham runs slower than Giggs. Beckham's team is as famous as Giggs'. I assume they are fantastic although their golden ages have been passed.
