In my home the television cheers me up because it broadcasts one of my favorite TV Show that I have been watching it for about a year. It brings me down when I miss it even one day. I am planing to buy a big TV so that I could watch at interval and also pick out some chairs. I want to take the curtains down and put up new because it is getting dirty. After that I am going to straighten up my room and kitchen and also throw away some old newspapers. At night I am going to ask ANON_NAME_0 over for dinner and after finishing I am going to drop him off to his home.
