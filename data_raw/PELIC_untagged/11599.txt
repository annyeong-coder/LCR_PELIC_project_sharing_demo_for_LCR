When we talk about friends there will be some mutual memories between you and your friends come up in your mind. In my whole life I have a lot of friends who I knew when we were children. We may not have the identical interests or characters but we can get along with each other. Today I want to introduce one of my bet friends who is my classmate from elementary school to high school and whom I have known more than 20 years his name is ANON_NAME_0 Chien Cheng. ANON_NAME_0 is very optimistic and humorous. When we studied in elementary school which is in our hometown some people gave ANON_NAME_0 a nickname which we still use instead of his real name. His nickname is Yellow Dog. Because his family name Hung which in Chinese language is yellow color so that's why he was nicknamed yellow Dog. Two years ago ANON_NAME_0 started working in Chulu Ranch which is a famous scenic spot in my hometown since that some friends of ANON_NAME_0's said ANON_NAME_0 is responsible for cows right now so he is promoted from a small yellow dog to a big shepherd . Anyway even though we always tease joke about make fun of him but he never gets angry with us. Of course he does not want to pass up any chance in which he can laugh at me or tease to me. However we do not meet each other very often now but every time when I go back home we will go out together for fun. We may go to a small noodle store whose owner is our friend to drink some beer or go to Chih Pen hotsprings where is a known hot spring in Taiwan. Anyway although we do not meet each other very we still can be good friends.
