I would agree on Stangor's idea which states that the stereotypes encourage people misjudgment on someone. I thing it could be unfair to categorize someone by stereotype them because individual people take individual type. For example when you and I stereotype Stangor we would have likely different ideas about Stangor whereas Stangor has his own type. It might be either what your or my thought or neither both. The stereotype can be harmful when one relies on only their stereotypy without logical reason. For instance when I decide to make a relationship with new friends if I briefly thought about a friend from Saudi Arabia who is selfish and polygamous I would not have had the best friends such as Marson and Sutan.
