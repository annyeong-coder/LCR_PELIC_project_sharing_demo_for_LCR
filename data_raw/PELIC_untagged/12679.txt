Dear FUWDP I understand the difficulty you have met. Without your mail I wouldn't have known this circumstance. I think your new neighbor might know your trouble if so she will find some ways to solve this problem soon. After all but for your kind she would have no chance to take her dog for a walk. However in order to make you feel better I will also give you some advice. First I suggest that you try to talk with her about her dog. You can praise her dog and ask her about the dog's habits. You can imply her it's very important that a dog have good habits. At this time I think she might understand what you want to say if not she will not avoid facing our next step's countermeasure. Second I recommend that you invite her and her dog to visit your garden. If her dog still has pooping in your yard you can let her see and listen to what she is going to say. It's crucial that she see her dog's behavior otherwise she would not acknowledge her dog's fault. If she still dose not apologize to you you can tell her directly that she should clean your yard. It's required that she be responsible for her dog's behavior. Don't worry about going out with her. You can find another good girl to go out with otherwise you wouldn't be called a real man! Sincerely Ms. Manners
