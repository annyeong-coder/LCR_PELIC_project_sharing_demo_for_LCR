I lived in Minasota for 5 years. Since I was 3 years old to 8 years old. That means I have been studying English for 19years. I hadn't studied hard. So I'm studying English in Pittsburgh. I have been living here for 3 months. Pittsburgh is a beautiful city. It has many activities such as festivals and parties. I have visited festivals. Also I have been to Kennywood. I have ride water boat 2times. It's wonderful place to join!
