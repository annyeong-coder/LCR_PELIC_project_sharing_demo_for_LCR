My family There are four group members in my family with totally different personalities and interests. First of all the leader of my family my father who is the oddest one and egotistical. What he cares the most is the plants and the flower. The second one is my mother who is temperamental but does care about me and my sister. She loves painting and having conversations with people including me and my sister. It is not so easy to have so much conversations with kids in our culture what she is doing is really amazing. The last one is my sister who is also egotistical and unbelievable. But we still having a good time living with each other because we all loves playing games and checking up interesting things in the world.
