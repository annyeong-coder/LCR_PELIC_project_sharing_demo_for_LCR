I am going to make a trip to New York City for the weekend in order to get rid of stress. First I am going to leave my house Friday night. As soon as I get New York City I will have to go to hotel to spend the night. When the sun comes up I am going to go to broadway to see art musical. After that I will walk the streets. Then I want to look at all the people passing by me. Because I want to see what New Yorks are like. At night I want to go to Time Spuare in order to see the sights at night. The next day I will probably have to go home. It'd going to be such a short trip. But I am sure that it will be wonderful time to make clear my mind.
