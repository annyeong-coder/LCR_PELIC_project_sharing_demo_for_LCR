OSS Hi everybody I'm Alias. I started this website for the people who are studying English as a second language. I've been studying English at the University of Pittsburgh for two months. I think it'd be better to study English outside the classroom for extra so that we can practice English in everyday life. I quite sure that everyone have a question about how to use English how to write an academic report etc. When I had questions and needed the answers form the native people it used to be hard to find someone who could answer me. By the time I moved to Pittsburgh I had designed to develop a website that helps people study English and had been learning how to develop it. Before I started developing the website I have invited some of my friends who are a native speaker to be a web assistance. Since then my website became well known. So let make a move together to success our goals!
