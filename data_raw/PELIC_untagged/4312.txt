Instead of quitting suddenly I should have considered one more because finding another job is also hard. When I quit suddenly my boss must have given me some advices but it's too late. My friend told me when my colleagues heard the news they had to have been surprised. I feel so sorry and I think that my boss and I could never have discussed any problem. I'm so regretful.
