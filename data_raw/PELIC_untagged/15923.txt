We usually make many judgments of each other and ourselves depending on previous knowledge but these judgments sometimes will be right and sometimes will be wrong. By this judgments we make wide idea about someone or something. According to David C. Funder we desperately need to know which of the judgments we make of each other and of ourselves are right which are wrong. For example before I came to the US I had the idea that the American people are not friendly. I think this idea comes from the UK. Because the English people are not friendly. I used to have this idea about American people. But now I changed my mind one hundred percent. Other example some student in the ELI thinking all the families in Libya have a camel I think it is right idea but not now because more than ninety percent of Libyan families now do not have one. Finally I can say our judgments are effected by the media.
