After the classes previous day I decided to go shopping. While I was walking two cars were in a wreck in the middle of the street. According to the first driver he didn't do anything wrong but the second driver said to the policeman The first driver was swerving. The officer asked to the first driver if he was swerving but the driver regretted and added she missed the red light. Then the policeman questioned a witness about the accident. The witness told that it was the first driver's mistake because he was swerving and added that He was on the phone. After the policeman questioned the witness the first driver had to accept that it was his mistake. He said that he was on the phone and wasn't sure if he was swerving. Finally the first driver said to the second driver that he was sorry and he mentioned I will be more careful.
