Saving energy is one of the most important things in today's world. Everyone knows that the sources of energy are limited. We will have no more energy to use in the future if we waste and do not do anything to save energy. We can do small things to begin saving the energy by ourselves. For example first I always go to school or back home by bus or walk to supermarket. Using the public transportation is the best way to save gasoline. Second I usually do laundry by myself if I can instead of using the washing machine. Most underwear and T shirts can be hand washed easily. It's a way to save electricity. Third I use fans instead of air conditioner or I open the windows of my apartment making the air flow through the room. It's not only a good way to save the energy but also good for my health.
