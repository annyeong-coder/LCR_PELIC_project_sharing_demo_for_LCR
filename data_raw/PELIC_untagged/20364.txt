Two years ago I went to France with my friends. We spent a week there. We took some items that we need for the trip. We took a compass to determine the directions. And we took many maps of France to define the places that we would visit it. Also we took a camera to take some pictures for the important places such as Eiffel Tower Arc of Triumph and Museum of Louvre. We rented a car from the airport and drove whole the trip. Finally we went to a few markets shopping.
