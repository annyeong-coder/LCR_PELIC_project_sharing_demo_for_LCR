Yes People will make more efforts to become a winner or the person having the best grade. It is a good way to encourage people and motive their enthusiasm. But the amount of the group should not be too big and the assignment should not be too stricted. Otherwise people may lose their zealous and become hopeless. In my case everybody in Taiwan have to pass a great national test after fifteen years old and their score will decide which high school they should attend. So all the young student are seperated into two opposite groups the students with high score and bright future and the students with low score and no future.
