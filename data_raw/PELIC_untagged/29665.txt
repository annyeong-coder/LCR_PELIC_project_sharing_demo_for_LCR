introduction in order to able to learn new language it is necessary to travel to country where a language is spoken to practice the language with native speakers and there are specialized institutes in the education of language in those countries. Native speaker good institutes body 1 I experienced learning English in language institute very weak only to get money body 2 I can't practice the language in my country hard to find native speaker must speak a language more than your native language body 3 I agree that there are many language institutes in my country and we can practice the language by watching TV and speaking with people who speak this language. However the language institutes in my country don't have enough experience in the field of learning language. Furthermore the teacher in these institute aren't native speaker and it is hard to to find a person who can speak this language I believe that it is necessary to travel to the country where a language is spoken to join institute practice with native speaker
