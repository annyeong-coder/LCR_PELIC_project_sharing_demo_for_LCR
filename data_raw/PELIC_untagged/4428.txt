My brother in low who is doing his master degree in mathmatics has only eyes. He lost one of his eyes when he was a 10 years old. The other eyes must get tired becouse he is using only one eyes. He lost his eyes when he taking the trash out of his home by someone who was throwing him by by small stick. He should have called the police for that accident. He could take him to the pression becouse of that. He didn t give up becouse of his problem but he complate his education and he could have been a douctor but becouse of that the school of medicin refuse to accept him in the college. He can't forget that day when he lost one of his eyes and that guy who was throwing him must not have forgettin that day too. My mother in low also can't forgive him becouse he is the reason for lossing her son's eyes and to let become a douctor.
