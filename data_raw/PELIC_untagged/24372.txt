There is a lot of free times in our live that we need to spend it in something that everyone likes. For me I like to spend my time in many ways! I like hanging out with people or work out sometimes. The first thing I always do when I want to waste the time is hanging out with other people. For example last weekend I spent it alone for that I felt kind of weird the time was so slow and boring in the same time because of that I realized I have to hang out with my friends. Sometimes times I work out during my free time It is good for my health and my body usually I work out because I want to loss some weight but when I have free time I would like to work out because I can think clearly for instance last night I felt homesick so what I did was working out. In summary a lot of people doing a lot of activety but for me I like hang out with people or work out because both of them makes me happy satesfaid and I can think more clearly
