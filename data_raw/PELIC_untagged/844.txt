Oct 16 2006 Dear Soon I want to buy a new computer because my computer is not work. So could you give me a piece of advice I have used a desktop computer for 8 years but it is not portable like a notebook computer. I think a notebook computer is lighter and smaller than a desktop computer so a notebook computer is more portable than a desktop computer. I want to use a computer at home and school so I need a notebook computer. I prefer a notebook computer rather than desktop computer. However a notebook computer is more expensive than a desktop computer. For example if I buy a notebook computer the cost is about 1500. But if I buy a desktop computer the cost is about 1000. This notebook computer and desktop computer are similar specifications but this notebook computer and desktop computer are different price. So what should I do Which do you prefer a notebook computer or a desktop computer I am waiting your answer. Thank you so much and hope to hear from you soon. Bye. Love SGY
