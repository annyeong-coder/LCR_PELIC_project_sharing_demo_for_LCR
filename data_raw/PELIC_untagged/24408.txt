During the spring break I got a bad cold. In the end of spring break my left ear felt very uncomfortable. When I took a nap in the evening I felt some water running out of my left ear. I was shocked that I had never had this experience before. I was also worried about my left ear. Although I had got sick several times in my country what shocked me was the water running out of my ear. Moreover I had a fever when I was sleeping. Therefore I went to see a doctor in UPMC Shadyside. The doctor said I got an ear infection because of the cold. Then I took the prescription to CVS to get my medicines. I was surprised by the fact that medicines are so expensive in the US. In my country I just have to pay a little because the health insurance system in Taiwan is operated by the government.
