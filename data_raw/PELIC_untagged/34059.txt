I will describe about my ideal home. I want quite house because don't like loud. I am finding very big house. And I will have beautiful garden big parking garage and a cute pet. Also I hope have a obliging neighbor who talk quietly and walk very slowly. When bright sunshine into the my garden it's really good and I will feel so happy. Maybe my house is absolutely perfect!!
