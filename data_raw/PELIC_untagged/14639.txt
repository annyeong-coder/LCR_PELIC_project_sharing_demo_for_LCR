I often think when I am tired of studying I should not have quit the job. I might have worked hard. I could have studied English more. I could have studied medicine more. My teacher ought not to have advised to go to the USA. My friend should not have said to me that I could get the job in USA. But I know I am just tired of studying so I always go to bed when I start to think such ideas.
