It is true that telling the truth is connacted with being honest that every people have to be have. However There are situations that we have to lie for benefits. To take one of the examples When someone askes you that the person is fat or not Would you tell someone the truth Even though the person is your best friend would you hurt that person's feeling You might lose your best friend forever. Awalys being honest can bring bad result. It is needless to say that always telling the truth is not the important consideration in any relation ship. Secondly telling the truth all the time might not disturb your enhancing social skills. It is true that lying is bad and dishonesty but little white lie might make you enhancing social skills. It doesn't mean that you have to lie in order to have great personality. You don't have to be too honest for your own benefits. For an example At your work you are tired of working. You are not going to tell your boss how you feel about your job all the time. You would rather tell your boss nice quotes. There is no doubt that it is not important to tell
