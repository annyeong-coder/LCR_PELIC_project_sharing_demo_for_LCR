I have to say that my mom who is very emotional and my daddy who is very rational did their best raising my brother my sister and me. I am not saying that they were or are perfect which is impossible but they did what they were supposed to do. Nowadays as a mother I understand my parents better than before. Being a parent bring a lot of dilemmas in our lives. As a parent we always want to make the right choices which sometimes can be difficult. However we always learn with ours mistakes and that is why we grow. Then in my opinion an ideal parent is a person who knows to love unconditional who knows to teach limits and who knows that sometimes there will be a wrong choice but is a person who always be there for us.
