Definition of Success I think that the word success is indefinable. Dictionary definition of success is to accomplish one's goal or to attain a high position and financial resources. I always bother that I have an experience of success or not when someone asks me about experiences of success. People who surround me would say that you have experienced success such as passing the admission exam of college I hope in my first attempt and getting a nursing certification. These experiences are merely process in my life. In other words these experiences would say first step to achieve my goal. Consequently I think that definition of success might depend on individual sense of value or sense of worth. One of my friends who got a nursing certification would say that it is one of the experiences of success. She studied hard and had difficult training to get a nursing certification. And she wanted to be a nurse since she was a child so it must succeed. I also wanted to be a nurse since I was a child. However I changed my mind to be a nurse who could take care of various types of patients after I got a nursing certification. If I achieved it I would set a goal again and again. Therefore I feel that I haven't succeeded yet even though these experiences are not failure. What is the difference between us I think that we would have different sense of value. Different sense of value could make different definition of success. To accomplish our goal might be one of success because these small successes would lead bigger success. We sometimes might feel that someone is a successful person. However he or she might not feel he or she is a success. In conclusion I think that others shouldn't decide that someone is a successful person or not. In other words for me the word success is indefinable.
