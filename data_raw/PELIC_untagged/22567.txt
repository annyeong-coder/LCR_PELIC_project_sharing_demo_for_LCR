It's not very easy to get a great place to live. In fact I've seen many people all of whom were ELI students looking for an apartment in Pittsburgh since I came here. In the cases of them what made finding an apartment hard was that they wouldn't stay here for a long time and they were not perfect at English to examine specific requirements. Therefore I'm going to give some foreigners useful suggestions when they should find an apartment in Pittsburgh getting as much advice as you can being prepared perfectly and practicing some phrases that you need. First ask your acquaintances to share any helpful information to find an apartment. There is no more accurate opinion than the experiencers' story especially if they are in the same circumstances as you. Before finding by foot you had better collect as many information as you can from people surrounding you. Second prepare for what you have to examine. Once you arrive at an empty room to check you might not notice some cracks that would occur severe problems in the future because almost of empty rooms look quite fine. Thus the best way is to write down what you have learned from people and carry it when you visit an apartment to buy. Last be confident in communicating with the previous owner of the apartment by practicing some English phrases in advance. Since you are not good at expressing what you think and what you wonder you may miss several crucial things that you should check. Also the owner could trick something if you don't look great at English. To prevent any disadvantages from English you must keep in mind to memorize some phrases that you need. To sum up because it's hard for foreigners to find an fine apartment in Pittsburgh it would be helpful that asking many people about your situation being ready to check specific options and memorizing important phrases in English. You may get a nice place if you consider at least these suggestions.
