My name is Sophie. I am from Korea. The Korean name is ANON_NAME_0 Last Name but it is too difficult so everybody calls me Sophie. I live in the dormitory. I am writing this in my room. This place is quiet so I like it but sometimes I feel lonely because I don't have any roommates. I am a senior in my university in Korea. I took a semester off to learn English. My major is Biology so I am considering applying to the University of Pittsburgh because the University of Pittsburgh is famous for health care but I am not sure yet. I am a full time student in the ELI and I am taking a TOEFL class and CCC also. Moreover I plan to volunteer and I am thinking about the Language Exchange Program so I think I will be very busy in this semester. Besides I love to travel so I will participate in various activities in ELI. I also like to see movies and listen to music. I am listening to music while I am writing this. What I hate to do is to get up early in the morning. I am always trying to get up early in the morning but I often fail because I like to watch movies or dramas with my computer at night. These days I am interested in cooking. My mother is not here so I have to cook by myself. If I am given an opportunity I want to cook Korean food for the classmates and teachers.
