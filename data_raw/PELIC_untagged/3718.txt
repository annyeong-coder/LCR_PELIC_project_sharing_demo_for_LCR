Betty SHOULDN'T HAVE AGREED to marry him until she knows in her heart that it's true. And also David OUGHT TO HAVE SHARED some of Betty's interests. She SHOULDN'T CALLED OFF the wedding because it's very rode. She MIGHT NOT HAVE THINK that he is the perfect man for her even though she don't know enough him. She WON'T HAVE TO MEET James anymore if she wanted to meet him and he wanted to meet her. I think they Betty and David CAN KNOW each other more and more if they spent a lot of time together.
