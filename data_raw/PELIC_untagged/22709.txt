The dinning room of my house is small and nicely decorated. Inside my dinning room there is not enough space but you can move gracefully. Standing at the kitchen's door which gives sight into the dinning room you will see a dinning table in oval form takes place in the middle with eight chairs two trough and trough in vertical line and three face to face in horizontal line. So the dinning table gives a little oval space around him where you can move with easiness. It is like a kind of little oval highway. The other thing that gives my dinning room a grateful comfort is the pleasant decoration. A hanging lamp is hung up in the center of the room. It gives not a thick or dazzling light but a nice yellow and little bright light. That makes everything clear and golden in the night. There is a furniture at the left corner of the enter of the kitchen. It contains books and cover by glazes doors. On the top of it there is two flower cans and three small paintings hanging above on the wall. You also find an other furniture to keep plates etc that made in wood and has glazes in the front as doors. What admiration of the view when the hanging lamp shines and that all the flowers glazes and paintings reflect the light in mixed color. A small widow next to the furniture of the plates gives the similar wonderful sensation in the day by letting go the sun rays through the room. Finally my dinning room is not enough spacious but everything find perfectly its place to be the decoration gives a sensitive view though you feel comfortably off while enjoying your dinner.
