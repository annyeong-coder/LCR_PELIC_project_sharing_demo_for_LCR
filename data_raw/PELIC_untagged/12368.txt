The importance of telecommunications nowadays in our life is undeniable. One of the great aspects of telecommunications today is the cellphones. The best feature of cellphones is that they are mobile. This means that you are always available whenever you are required to be contacted. Weather the cellphones cause cancer or not is still a controversial issue among the experts and researchers. According to Brody 2002 In other words cellphones which operate with radio frequencies do not emit radiation that damage DNA. So I would say at this point cancer is the least of one's worries when it comes to using cellphones. In my perspective as it has not been proved scientifically yet that cellphones cause cancer and it has been proved practically that they are a great asset so just keep using them comfortably without any worries.
