Centre My Apartment in Pittsburgh indent I live in Shadyside in a gorgeous two bedroom apartment. It is located near schools hospitals and shopping markets that makes it very accommodating. It's on the 6th floor so it's pretty sunny with a gorgeous outside view. It's very old building when you get inside you will feel that it's like a cave. But when you get inside the apartment you will see that it's like a palace. Directly to your right there is a closet large enough to make a bed room. Then when you go a bit further you will be in the living room which is the place I like best to relax in. I'm trying my best to make it clean because my friends usually visit me during the weekends. During the week it is usually beeing unregulated as kids play ground. When you go a bit beyond the living room you will see the kitchen which is small like a closet but I use it a lot for making my lunch. Then you can see the bathroom on the right and my room in front of you. My room is a medium size it's usually missed up unlike my roommate's room. But I try to clean it up every weekend. Briefly I like to live in my apartment and I don't think to change now.
