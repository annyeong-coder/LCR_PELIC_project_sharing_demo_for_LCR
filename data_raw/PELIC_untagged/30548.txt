I think there are 3 differences between 2 texts. First Choosing to Be Different is comprised of fact and data but Leisureville is comprised of writer's description and conversation with the residents. Moreover in Choosing to Be Different there are some kinds of withdrawing so there is not detail of each type. However in Leisureville there is one example and there are more details than another text. Next in the Choosing to Be Different retirement communities are described positively however in Leisureville they are described negatively. Finally the title of Welcome to Leisureville contains a little irony compared with Choosing to Be Different which is directly expressing the content.
