I would like to do some changes in my classroom to make it appropriate for studying. First of all I would like to cover the window up by blinds to block the sunlight out from coming in during the summer season. Also I would like to hang a new clock up on the wall to let students and teachers know the time during the class. In addition walls must be touched up especially the one in the back because it is in contact with students' chairs. We should throw away the unused equipments to enhance the space. We should also move the multimedia center around to the opposite corner of the classroom. Students and teachers may pick out some nice pictures or drawings to hang them up on the walls. I think we need to take off the old carpet and replace it with new carpet that has a different color. I think we need to turn the teacher's desk around to give more space to students to move around. Finally we need to pick up new studying desks to replace the old ones.
