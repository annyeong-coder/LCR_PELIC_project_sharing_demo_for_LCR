I Know some of you are discouraged because it is taking you so long to run five miles but don't give up yet because after eight years your broke the time from 45 to 30. 5. The different 14. 5 Is very good. Look at the chat the first year you'll decrease big number. When compare first year with another years is big different but the vary will be continue. Then no thing comes easy. Finally with time you'll take five miles in short time or more faster.
