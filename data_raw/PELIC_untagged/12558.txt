Tom Higgins's restaurant doesn't have enough money. Money is the most important factor for business so he must secure money because when he has enough money he can plan the business strategies. Now I will demonstrate how to secure money. First he asks his family. If they know that he is in difficult circumstances about economy they will help him. However if affects that he rely on his family. Second he requests the bank. The bank helps him if he paid interest every month. If he can't easily lend money he uses a secured loan service. In the bank flexible down payment plans and low mortgage rates will wait for him. Last he finds a business partner. Although he can't make more money it is not dangerous. Also he doesn't need to pay interest and he can invest more money to his restaurant. His partner also tries to achieve their business. Two brains are better than one brain so I recommend he finds a business partner. I wrote my perspective. I know that success of business is very difficult. If he tries to achieve his business he can do it because all of people have the potential abilities.
