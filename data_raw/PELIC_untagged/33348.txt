I'm going to put in the time capsule five different things. First I'm going to put the hooka because I'm trying to leave it . Everyone knew smoking caused for many serious diseases. So I put it in time capsule as an warning letter. Second I will put some books like the secret and the seven habits of highly effective people. These books make a difference in people. Third my favorite hobby of collecting currency so I will put a range of different currencies. Maybe I can invest in the future. Fourth I will put some pictures for my family and me. Finally I'm going to put the grammar book in the time capsule as a memory. Time capsule a unique experience I hope to do it. I hope that my children are open it .
