These days Webaholism is a new problem that is leading a grave issue. It's an addiction for on line. To students who are living in Millennium era computer and Internet is essential stuff that they can't help using but you have to control yourself. If you cannot you become a Webaholism patient. In a way I think it is a good idea that school's limiting student's time in on line system in school. It can help students to prevent wasting time in the Internet. To some students who need much Internet time maybe would have some inconvenience but they can divide their time between school and home. Good education can leads students to having a good habit. In the all the thing it's not bad to doing much. Webaholism is a new type addiction so we can addict it before one knows. We need to careful attention to it.
