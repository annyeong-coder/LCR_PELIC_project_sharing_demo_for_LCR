In my opinion it is very important for parents to pass on cooking skills to their children. They have to know how to cook so in future they can help them selves by them selves in kitchen. On the other hand it's better for them to eat a healthy food which is made by their hands. Also girls specially need to have cooking skills because they often will be responsible about their families. Finally I think it's very interesting to cook. Of course we could learn first cooking lessons in our homes. So parent should give these interesting lessons for their children.
