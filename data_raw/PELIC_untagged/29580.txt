I have been to Japan sice I graduated from my high school. I have decided to apply enginer university while I was studying Japanese at laguage course. As my wish I got an admission. I have done two part time jobs when I was studying at university. It was a good life experience. After graduation I had been working at a company which produce vaccum machine for several years. I have been the States for 4 months.
