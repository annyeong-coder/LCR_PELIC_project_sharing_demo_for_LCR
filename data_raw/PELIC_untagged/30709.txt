I grew up in Riyadh founded by King ANON_NAME_0. Riyadh which is the capital of Saudi Arabia is considered to be the biggest city in Saudi Arabia. Riyadh like many other Middle East cities has exploded into a modern and it has many vibrant commercial centers with many western characteristics. This rapid growth can also be reflected in the population which has boomed from 667 000 in 1974 to more than 5 million today. I lived in Alryyan neighborhood located in the east of Riyadh. Our neighbors most of whom are doctors due to being near the biggest hospital are very friendly and sociable. The Governor of Riyadh whose name is Salman Ibn ANON_NAME_0 and who has been as governor for more than 55 yeas is trying now to build new ring roads and new attractions.
