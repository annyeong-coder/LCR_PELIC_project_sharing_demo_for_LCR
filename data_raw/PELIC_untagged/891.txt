I think that my friends who are living in Japan are good teacher for me. So far I learned a lot of things that I could not learned in the class from my friends. Normally their behavior is not special in normal days. We spent a time to do the chatting eating or whatever. However when they met the difficult things some friends showed the power that I have never saw in the normal days. For examples Mr. Matsu is the one of my friends who is computer programming specialist. When I had gotten the PC problems in my PC he gave me the solutions for the problems promptly. When he was trying to solve the problems he was concentrating very well. While he was trying to do that I was thinking that I can not do that but I want to do that like him someday. In contrast some friends' behavior is not good. Some through the trash away on the road others does not make a promise. The proverb that is well known in Japan says that when you saw the bad behaviors of somebody you should correct the own behaviors. Overall my friends are the good teacher. They can tell me the both good things and bad things.
