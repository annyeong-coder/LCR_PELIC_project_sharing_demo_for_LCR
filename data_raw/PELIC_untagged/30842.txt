Most people in the USA study or work during the weekdays from Monday through Friday. As an international student in the beginning I didn't understand Americans philosophy in enjoying their Friday nights and Sunday days. I was first biased against staying up late on Friday nights. But being influenced by the American lifestyle now I invite my friends over to spend their night with me or I go out with them. Every Friday I see from people faces how excited they are . In the USA most people like to stay up at night every Friday while they go to sleep early on Sundays preparing for the following Monday. My neighbors always invite me for parties on Friday nights and they stay up late. I was first surprised and puzzled wondering why they don't wait till Saturday morning to enjoy their time off. And now I stay up late on Fridays watching a movie playing music dancing or even drinking coffee at 12 Am! While I wake up early on Sunday mornings to go outside to enjoy any activity that get me out of my place.
