On the economy we've made little A LITTELE progress but we still have a great many A GREAT DEAL OF work to do so there are several measures I'm proposing. First I want to raise taxes on the very wealthy because a few FEW of them are really paying their share. Second many of MANY OF THE members of the middle class are carrying an unfair burden so I'm asking for a tax cut for the middle class. If I'm successful most of you in the middle class will be paying 10 percent less in tax next year though few A FEW of you in the higher income group may see your tax rise little A LITTLE. The problem with the national income tax is that there are much MANY loopholes in the current law which allow any SOME people to avoid paying any tax at all I want to close these loopholes. My additional plan is to replace the lost revenue with a national tax which is fairer because it applies to every ALL people equally. Third we have no money to finance health care reform and we've made a little LITTLE progress in reducing pollution and meeting clean air standards. Therefore I am asking for a 50 cent a gallon tax on gasoline which will result in many MUCH more people using transportation and will create additional revenue.
