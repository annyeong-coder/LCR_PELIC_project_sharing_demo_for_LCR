I already have my plans for the coming summer. First when I finish the ELI semester I'm going in May to visit my sister in Boston because she will give birth. When I come back I'm going to pack my bags and I will go back to Lebanon to visit my family and my friends. In Lebanon I will go to the beach and I'm going to attend many weddings. At the end of summer I will come back to Pittsburgh and hopefully I'm going to attend classes next fall.
