Since we have started unit 11 in the grammar book I learned much information about Feng Shui theory. I have started figure it out and how it increases energy. Now I am thinking about set up new ideas to reorganize my living room. I want to keep on some furniture but I need to throw away old ones. My living room is 15'9 17'6 with some dark corners. I need to light them up by adding some light on. My wife and me are students and we need more energy goes around living room. So we came up with taking down the old curtain and picking out new one. We have to wash the cushions and put them back facing the North. We considered to put new bright wall's paper up but we need to think over again. ANON_NAME_0 Alduayji
