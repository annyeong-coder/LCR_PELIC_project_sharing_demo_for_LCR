Dear Mr. ANON_NAME_0 I write a letter to you to complain about the Computer Training Institute. I think you'd better renovate it. The room is old and almost nothing is working. The windows are broken and the room is dirty. It has only one computer and we have to stand always in a row. Many students are angry about it. You should placed more PC's. Moreover the printer is out of order. You ought to repair it because we have to print many materials as well as the lights. There are damaged. Lastly you should employ a manager who is responsible for the room.
