I have been playing football since I was a child. I have played football with the same group of friends. Last year we changed our plan. We decided to travel to different countries. Last summer we traveled to two countries in Europe. Then we decided to explore other countries in Asia and Africa. Because of that I have started to collect stamps from these countries. So far I have found many stamps from other parts of the world.
