If Synesthesia can help me memorize more information and English vocabulary then I would like to have one. One that hooks my sight sense with my hearing sense together. Therefore whenever I hear new word I can see it with bright colors in order to memorize it and not forget it. Hence I might memorize the dictionary and score high in slandered English tests.
