Dear Sand I think that you could call him first to care about him. Probably he ought to set down everything that He just have no time to contact you! He just move to there over a week ago that you should have more patience to wait for him have set down his new place! If you really want to live with him you could find out any good job in Minnesota now but you had better consider it deeply. Hope you find out your right way! Good luck to you! Chatty
