It's very difficult to learn English. As the ways of life between Korea and the US or England are different concepts of the two languages are very different. Korean words and English words are not matched one by one. When I started my English studies in middle school I focused on memorizing English words. If I had to express my idea in English I was looking for the exact English word that had the same meaning with a Korean word. But it was very difficult. In order to explain one Korean word properly I needed many English words. While there were many words to express one object or one notion their meanings were slightly different in nuance. So I realized that I had to learn English expression not just a word.
