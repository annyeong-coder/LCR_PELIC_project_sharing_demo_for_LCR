Adana where I was born is a Mediterranean city. Adana is the most important city for me because I grow up and passed very beautiful days there. I have many friends in Adana with whom I went to beach in the summers and enjoyed with him much. We lived in a big house in Adana that we were crowded family those days. I have 3 brothers and 3 cousins. Unfortunately these days we lived in other cities since when we graduated from university. I have a cousin who is a businessman and whose company is really important in Adana. He employs many worker there. In addition my brother is an artist whose works many people know.
