Eid Al Fitr Muslims have many celebration days. One of them is Eid Al Fitr. It is a holiday that comes after Ramadan Holy month that all the Muslims fast during . Eid al Fitr is a gift from god after the days we fast. In most countries the Muslims prepare for Eid al Fitr the last four or five days of Ramadan. To get prepared for this holiday the materials for the traditional clothes must be bought Dishdasha the traditional cloth for men . The women spend more money than men by buying many dresses. The parents should go to buy some candies and traditional sweets Darabeel which is a rolled sweet that we eat with hot milk that visitors enjoy eating it. They also should go to the bank to get money to give their family members especially the young kids. They all cooperate to make these days the best. On the morning of this day all men and women gather in a big place. All the neighbors have the chance to meet each other and to strengthen relationships the men are separated from the women they pray and thank god for this holiday that came after a month of fasting. Then every family returns home to get prepared for this celebration. After praying the families start to gather. Most of families gather in the grandparent's house. All the families have a great chance to see each other spend time talking and eating sweets and candies. After that all of the family members gather around the grandfather and the grandmother and they start saying stories of how they celebrated in the past. Finally the family members start giving out money to children and to the older boys and girls. Finally everybody of the family returns home and has a good sleep after a long day. This is Eid Al Fitr that all the Muslims celebrate and love. It's a nice gift after fasting one whole month. The main target of fasting is to remember the poor people and how they feel. I love these days and enjoy so much and all Muslims wait to get the chance to celebrate it.
