I come from Taiwan. Taiwan is in the subtropical zone. It is an island located in the south east of China. The Jade Mountain is the highest mountain in Taiwan. We have 3 traditional festivals Chinese New Year Dragon Boat Festival and Mid Autumn Festival. In the Chinese New Year people go home and have family reunions. On the Dragon Boat Festival we usually eat Zong Zi and race dragon boats. We believe that the moon on the Mid Autumn Festival is the biggest one in the year. There is a very famous beverage from Taiwan called Pearl Milk Tea. Moreover there are also lots of delicious foods in Taiwan. It is believed that most foreigners love Taiwanese cuisine.
