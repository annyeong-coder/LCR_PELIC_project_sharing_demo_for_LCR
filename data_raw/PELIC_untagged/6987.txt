I am going to finish my ESL in the next semester. After that I will complete my master degree in MBA. I might move to another university if I can't find acceptance in the University of Pittsburgh. Also I may transfer to another university in another city or state if I can't find acceptance in Pittsburgh. Then after I graduate I will go back to my country and I will look for a good job with good salary. Also I might buy a big house and I could buy also crazy car.
