In the first semester when I was a senior I didn't pay attention in my project. The curriculum defined that I had to finish my final project in that semester. At that time I didn't understand the details of this project and I was afraid to see my professor because my project had not improved. I tried to avoid seeing him as much as possible. Because of that I couldn't finish my project in the fist semester and I had to continue it in the second semester. Fortunately I finished it this semester. This was my third semester for this project. Actually my university has only two semesters per year. I was very glad because I could graduate on time. In my opinion in the first semester I should have paid more attention to my project and I should have seen my professor more often because he could have explained my misunderstanding and help me fix my problems. I realized that in the last semester.
