I have thought about painting. I've liked painting since I grabbed a pen and a brush. I thought about painting as a hobby seriously after graduating from the university. But I have been busy with my work. I've had no spare time to go to the painting institute and to paint. Instead of painting I go to the art museum very often. I am satisfied to appreciate the beautiful works on the wall. However I want to try to paint someday.
