I waked up at six and picked up a nice suit. My company is going on the right way. I called back my main customer yesterday we figured out the problem. The old contract will end up in a week. We will sign up a new contract. We thought over the price. I have turned down 5 of the price. I am a good salesman I never give up I have always kept on trying. I can hand on challenge. I love to talk into customers.
