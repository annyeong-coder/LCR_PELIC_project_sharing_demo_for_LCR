My name is jasim alNahas. I am in Pittsburgh for 5 months. I am from Saudi Arabia. I live in Tabuk. In contrast I prefer to live in Jeddah. I am planning to copelete my graduate studies that are master and PHD. As a result I am taking level 4 on ELI this semester to improve my language skills. I like to submit my homework before the dead line so that I am typing this assignment at the morning. I like to sleep late. So I feel tired because I didn't sleep well yesterday. However I am feeling happy for finishing this assignment and submitting to Briane . Thank you
