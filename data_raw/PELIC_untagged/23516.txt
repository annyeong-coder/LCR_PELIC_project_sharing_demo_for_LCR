If I had married with a bank man whom I was introduced by my brother I might have had no experiences to live in Germany or the U. S. If I hadn't worked for Mitsubishi Heavy Industry I wouldn't have met with my husband who is an engineer and I wouldn't be living in the U. S. Now. If I had kept working at the company after marriage I might not have been able to keep house for my family. Had I not been a homemaker I couldn't have studied nutrition and psychology. If I hadn't studied nutrition I couldn't have controlled my mother in law's diabetes easily without any medicine. Had I not studied psychology for mental health I couldn't have given my daughter a proper peace of advice about human relationship which was very complex. If I were in Japan I would be continuing to study psychology. Had I known we moved to the U. S. I could have practiced English conversation in Japan more early. If I hadn't decided to study English at ELI after coming to Pittsburgh my skills on English and the computer would be never improved. I wish I were younger for studying English and if only my brain worked more clear headedly.
