Topic a time when you lost your wallet. Five years ago it was the first time that I almost lost my wallet. I went shopping with a couple of friends at JJ a well known open market in Bangkok. In that day my parents dropped me off at the market because it was far from home and it could take so much time if I had to catch the bus. One of my friends was late so most of us had waited for a half hour. During the morning some of my friends bought several T shirts but I had not bought anything yet until I had seen a jeans store. I decided to buy a new pair of jeans priced at 100 which was quite expensive however I bought it. When I paid for the jeans I found that my wallet was not there. One of my friends paid it for me because I had no money to pay. After that I went separate ways from my friends so as to search for the wallet. Until that evening I could not find my wallet. When I arrived home I told my father what happened to me. Fortunately my father said that it was not a big deal because I had dropped my wallet in his car in the morning. It was the first time when I almost lost my wallet. I should have checked with my father once I realized that my wallet was missing at the first place. It was a great experience though that I could be more careful with my belongings. Eventually I developed my habit to keep an eye on my valuable items before I get off vehicles.
