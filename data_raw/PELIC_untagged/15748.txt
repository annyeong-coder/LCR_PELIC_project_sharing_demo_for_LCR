My room is in Linfen city China. I need to straighten up it when I get up at morning. I am thinking over to change it because it is not easy to keep out stealing. It is very small I do not cheer up when I go back everyday. I was born and grow up in the room. So I do not want to break down it I plan to set up a new room near it.
