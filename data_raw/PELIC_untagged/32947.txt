When I was a child I used to wake up early and help out my father to straighten our farm up. We kept on cutting the trees down. We were doing that over every week. In addition we had a large pool in the middle of this farm. I used to fill the pool up and swam. Then I got back home and take my clothes off. Unfortunately my father sold this farm. I am planning to take it back by buying it from the person who buy it.
