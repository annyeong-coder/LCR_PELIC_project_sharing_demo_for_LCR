In 1999 my friend and I were in Frankfurt. We were surprised when we came down from the plane and intering into the airport of Fankfurt. Really it was very big and it has more than fifty gates. We spent a wonderful time during a week and after that we went to Hanover which has located in the middle of Grmman. The weather was very nice in Hanover and ther are many awesome public garden park. Definitely we are very lucky when we saw the yearly festival which call carnival. We had enjoyed overther afew days. Unfortunate we planed for this trip just two weeks.
