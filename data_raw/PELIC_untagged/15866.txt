Someone from a travel agent called me last month when I got back home. I was so tired and I ask him to call me back later. Two days after He called me again and asked me to listen for his agent offer about a trip to Hawai. I agreed for listening and he began to speek about this offer and how I can pick out the airlines and the hotels rank. He stood try out. Actually he talked me into this offer due to I was really need to get vacation. Finally I changed my mind when he started the taxes details over because it was too much. Honestly he let me down after that and finally I hunge up the phone.
