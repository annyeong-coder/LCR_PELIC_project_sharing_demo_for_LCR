I think that will be best guardian is Lydia. I have three reasons to support my decision. The first one is because she was very good Crowley's friend and she loves their children. Caroline shows us her love for her friend Lydia and she demonstrate that she wants Lydia as her children's guardian so much because Lydia was as sister for them. The second point Lydia wants to be the children's guardian even she must to stop his career for a few months. End the last reason is because Lydia can come back to USA and then to be continue her career here with the Bay Symphony Orchestra. I could tell more reasons but I think that reasons are sufficient for justify my decision. I believe that ANON_NAME_0 and ANON_NAME_1 can't to be a guardian for children. The principal reason they didn't have a good relationship with the Crowleys. ANON_NAME_0 maybe didn't have big trouble with Victor and Caroline but probably he wasn't so close to them because the Crowleys knew about his financial trouble and they didn't like that lifestyle. ANON_NAME_1 lets clean to us that her never been good relationship with her sister. So in my opinion they aren't available to be the children's guardian.
