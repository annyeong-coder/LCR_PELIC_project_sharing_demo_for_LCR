When I came America I was not able to cook very well. I used to go to many restaurants such as the Cathedral caf o she taught me steps for doing it. I tried hard as much as I could to make the food as my mother method and it was the first time for me to cook as well. To be specific I tried to make rice and chicken putting together by using major ingredients such as the Saudis' spices. Fortunately I made as mother did! And it was delicious.
