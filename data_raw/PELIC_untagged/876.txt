German proverb said that friendship is a plant which we must often water. I think this means that a friendship looks like a plant which we need to look after. If we always take care of it it can grow up or die if we don't care it. We can make friends easily with people who meet and talk with us. But we can make a friendship with someone who is well compatible and understandable with us harder than make friends. If we have a friendship we should bring it up. In this semester I'm studying at the ELI in University of Pittsburgh. I have a lot of friends who came from different countries. I'm studying in five different classes which are writing reading grammar speaking and listening class. I have other classmates in each class. There are Taiwanese Korean Japanese Turkish Brazilian and Saudi Arabian who are in same class. ANON_NAME_0 who is a Korean girl is my good friend. Jin Hee who studies same three classes as me lives in the same building so sometimes we go back home together. She also is similar aged. We will be here in next semester so our friendship will grow up. Unfortunately most of our group which are other students will go back their countries in next semester. We don't need others go back. It was very funny when a lot of people stay together so we hope we will have good friends in next semester.
