The telephone is in the living room where there is a TV and a CD player. Usually when I pick up a phone call I have to turn down the volume of TV or CD player. If not I could barely figure out what opposite just said. At this movement I got to turn off these and say Hold on a second Sir. Then we go on talking. Recently I have been thinking over to move the telephone to another place and I have been starting talking my uncle into consideration. Our discussion turns out with a good result that he will keep on placing the telephone in the living room but he will have another phone in other room. Accordingly he asked me to find out something in ebay.
