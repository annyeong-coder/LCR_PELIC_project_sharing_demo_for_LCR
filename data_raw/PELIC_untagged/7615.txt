An accident on greyhound trip It happened in February this year. The snow was keeping covered all the roads and it was reported as the largest snow in the northeast of America this winter. The roads were becoming icy. Many accidents were reported these days due to the icy road. I had to take greyhound bus to come back to Pittsburgh from New York City after an interview was held on Friday noon because all planes were cancelled due to the bad weather. The greyhound bus was finally started to get on his way to Pittsburgh at midnight after it was postponed several times. It was in the early morning an odor smell was tasted on the rear part of the bus. The driver realized an accident might be happened so that he stopped the bus. All passengers were forced to get off the bus and stand on the roadside in the cold winter. 911 Were called and policeman came to try to find the problems. Although we were almost frozen in the cold weather fortune tally no one was hurt.
