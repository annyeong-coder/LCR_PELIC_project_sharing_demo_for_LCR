First of all sharing illegally copyrighted contents is criminal behavior. Netizens steal copyrights of contents' creators too easily. For example netizens can easily download and share copyrighted contents such as movies music computer programs etc from the Internet using kinds of peer to peer programs. But the pain of creation must be rewarded by netizens who want to use copyrighted contents. If this criminal behavior occurs constantly netizens can not enjoy creative inventions anymore. On the other hand if creative inventions are rewarded and valued netizens can enjoy good quality contents.
