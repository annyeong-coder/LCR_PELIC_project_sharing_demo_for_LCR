Movies There are three different types of movies. The first type is action movies. Action movies use some action movements or some strange movements to surprising the viewers. Also the actress and actor always use odd action movements to give unusual sections or parts of the movie. I have some examples of actions movies. The first example is Bad Boy. The second example is Hot Fuzz. The last example is Stallone Rambo. The second type of movies is horror movies. Horror movies use some machinery to scare the people who watch the movies. In addition horror is always created in dark places use a lot of bloods and ghosts. Some examples of horror movies are Saw1 Saw2 and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The third type is Romance movies. The romance movie is kind of love movies. This kind is always with men and women who talk about their life. The examples of romance movies are Two Weeks Notice Wimbledon and Nights in Rodanth. In conclusion the different types of movies which I explained above are action horror and romance.
