If I Won the Lottery There are many things I would like to do it if I get a lot of money. First I would like to travel around the world I hop to visit France Italy Holand and Australia because I like to discover everything which is new for me. Also I always dream to get a big house to live in I want my house to be big which has three or four bedrooms a big dining room and a nice garden around it. Because my current house is very small because of this when someone visits me and he wants to stay for a few days that annoys me. Another thing I would like to help the poor people who did not have enough money to buy food to eat. Finally if I won the lottery I would spend almost all of it on the people who need help in my country.
