When I was in middle school I took a responsibility of cheer reader on behalf of my class. There was a dance contest among each class. At first I was nervous and I didn't know how to make dance combining a lot of motions. However some of my best friends helped me make motions and I researched to find easy and interesting motions watching a dance video. I was so involved in making motions that I could get some unique and special motions. Finally our class won the first prize in the dance contest I was proud of me and I realized that the greatness of flow.
