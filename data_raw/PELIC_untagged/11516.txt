I don't belive that open adoption is a good idea. I don't think that the problem is in the child because children can understand a lot of things and accept those things in a very easy way. I think that the problem is in the parent's feelings. I can't immagine how a birth parent could accept this kind of subordinate role in the child education. I think that adoption is a good thing that is very usefull and somethime necessary but I belive it must be confidential.
