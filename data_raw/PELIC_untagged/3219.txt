Indent Cell phones and email make communication between people faster and easier. For instance our grandparents had to wait around 15 20 days to receive news of their relatives outside the country now advanced technology permits to do it in seconds through cell phones and email. For example members of families who live in different cities or countries can communicate every day by cell phone or email and find out about each other. Furthermore when workers of a company travel to another country for business they can communicate all the time with their bosses and coworkers with these tools making business decisions quicker and easier. Moreover students have the opportunity to send homework to their teachers by email and be in touch with their friends by cell phone. However the technology is not perfect and sometimes cell phones and email don't work very well. For example emails occasionally don't arrive on time or if your computer has a problem you cannot use your email. In addition the cell phone signal is not powerful enough in some places or sometimes the battery of these apparatus loses power in the middle of an important communication. In conclusion although cell phones and email are excellent and necessary tools in our lives sometimes they are not safe to use.
