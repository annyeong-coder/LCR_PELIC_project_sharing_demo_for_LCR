I went to the Dry Tortugas National Park via Key West with my husband by riding on a boat. We should have taken a Cessna instead of the boat. Because we could have prevented that he got terrible seasick. I enjoyed snorkeling while he took a rest on a bench. I saw lots of beautiful fish and I got tan. I shouldn't have been snorkeling for a long time for I couldn't have suffered the pain of sunburn.
