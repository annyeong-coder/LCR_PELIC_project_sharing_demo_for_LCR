I got my latest job in july. Before I got this job I had been directing my own business and studying to improve my English also. It was a job for surveying. I had worked with the office of surveying in january for 25 days. I had done a good job so they had kept my name in their database. I hadn't expected them to call me for a job when they called me. I had been enjoying my city life when they sent me in a hard suburb as a supervisor for a pool. I had to work with people I had never seen before. I had been worrying about working with people I hadn't met yet. I had already supervised the same kind of work so as soon as we started I observed that It was a easy. We had done the job for 30 days before I left for the USA.
