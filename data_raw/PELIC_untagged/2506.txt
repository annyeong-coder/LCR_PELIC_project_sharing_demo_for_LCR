Cultural expectations of success for males and females in China There are different cultural expectations of success for males and females in China. . On my opinion I think there are many reason like the job market background of personal life of value and responsibility of personal etc. Here I will talk about the job market. In China Males and females both can have a chance to get a good job but working chance for males are greater than for females. In gerenal males think if they earn a lot of money they are successful. They expect to support their family by themselves. They don't like their wives going to work. Another reason for example If a wife earns more salary than her husband it is trouble for the relationship. Her husband doesn't feel good he will feel he is challenged his confidence is drop down. This is also a problem becoming a successful woman. On the other hand females think they must go to work because if they get a job they will feel safe and independent but if they want to get a good job it is too difficult for them many companies think if females are married they can't work well. For example you need time to give birth to your childand you need to spend time on looking after your child. Therefor many companies give job offer to males more than females. So I think becoming successful females are more difficult than becoming successful males because there are different cultural expectations of success for males and females in China.
