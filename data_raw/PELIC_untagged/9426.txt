I am so happy that I grew up in one of the nicest cities in the world which is Marrackech. Marrakech is always known as a wonderfull place to spend your vacation with your family or with your friends. One of the reason that makes Marrakech verry famous is the location. Marrakech has a close distance wether you are coming from Europe or North of America. Second reason is the weather. Because of the mountains that around Marrakech it gives to the city a wonderfull healthy weather. Onther reason is people. Most of the Marrakchi poeple are so hospital helpfull and friendly. All of that makes Marrakech so speciall and a lovely place not just to visit but also to live.
