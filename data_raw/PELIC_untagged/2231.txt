I disagree with this statement. For my experience the good luck effects the success when we do something which is any kind of for example doing course works or processing a projecting. Of course the main reason we success is our efforts so it can't be ignored. But although we are hard workers in our works sometimes it doesn't turn out as a good result. If we lose a timing which is good for you or a chance which is the perfect time for you success turns into the failure. So it's necessary for us to have a good luck when we do something that we want to make well.
