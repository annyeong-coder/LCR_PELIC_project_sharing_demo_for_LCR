After graduate most Korea young people try to get jobs. For getting jobs even though they are students they do not study hard and just try to get career. Unfortunately economy has been affected this problem for a long time most Korean are hard to get jobs therefore people who do not have jobs increase. There are two solutions for this problem First of all the government has to help them. The government should make some classes or organizations to educate people. Make classes and educate them some professional skill and specific skill. Also the government should establish more jobs. People always want to work in popular part of work although there is no place to work. The government could establish new laws for work. Let people work as much as possible. Second Korean's social views have to change. Most Korean think that they have to work in good conditions. Even though person who does not work for high income because of social view they choose the work for high income. Every job is important for everyone.
