Welcome to my website! I'm Wes. I have lived in Korea since I came to Pittsburgh in U. S. I made this website to share my hobby. I have been playing the guitar since I was senior of middle school student. When I was middle shool student I wanted to learn about playing the instrument because I had been listening to rock music. So I learened about playing the guitar with my best friend who wanted to learn to the bass. After 7 years I have played the guitar profesionally when I was freshman in the my universty. I have played it in the jazz club. I was also member of another band in my university. I have prepared the contest which is the university song festival. Anyway! I have included file for learning to the guitar on this page. If you want to find how to play the guitar well you will enjoy this website!
