ANON_NAME_0 02 15 2007 final writing ch. 1 2 Nd draft I think every one has his studying habit but for me I have my own studying habit . I prepare many things before I begin studying. For instance I turn on the music such as Arabic music. I make something to drink such as tea or coffee and I bring my tools such as pencil notebook and highlighter . Also I think that the environment is a very important thing for studying . For example I like to study at the library with bright light in the warm temperature. In addition I have many methods for studying. For example sometimes I highlight important ideas in the reading book sometimes I read new ideas several times and sometimes I write and rewrite information in my notebook. I think that in this way I can study and understand every thing .
