I think I am an introvert. An introvert is a person who gets energy from being alone. My hobbies which are reading books watching movies and walking around alone show that I am an introvert. I can speak well with people who are my close friends or my family. If I am with other people who are not my friends or people whom I do not like I can not speak well. And I think I am a feeler. My decision depends on my personal value. For example when I was a high school student I went to see a movie with my friends. I wanted to see a movie which was a Korean movie but not popular but my friends said the movie was said that it was not interesting by people who saw the movie. But I really wanted to see that so I persuaded my friends to see the movie with me. Finally they went to see the movie. But the movie was not bad.
