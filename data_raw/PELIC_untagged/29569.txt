I believe teach children how can they Opening doors for others is make our children more respect and help. When going into buildings allow elders to go first and open the door for them. When preceding others into a building don't let the door slam in the face of those behind but hold the door until the person behind can grab it. Also teach our children that if someone holds the door for them then remember to say thank you.
