My apartment is spacious and I want to make some changes. I feel it is vacant when I come back from school. I have to pick up some landscape paintings and hang them up. Next my living room is too dark so I need a lamp to light it up. Also I don't like the color of the walls in my bedroom. I hope that I can fix it up. In order to prepare the TOEFL test I don't have enough time to straighten up my apartment. I'm going to clean it up and throw the trash away after the test. Furthermore I want to improve the environment surround my apartment. I will send out a mail to request the Pittsburgh's mayor to put up a police station nearby because my neighbors always party at midnight. I hope the mayor can work it out.
