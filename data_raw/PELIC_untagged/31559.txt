Some people in America and around the world believe that alien from other stars have visited the earth. However some scientists are doubtful about these stories. They are thinking about how alien can travel the earth. Scientists know that distance between the earth and the nearest star to the earth is so long. The fastest object that was created by human is Helios. It travels 2500 mile per second. Furthermore it is said that if people use that object to travel to the nearest star to the earth it will take 19000 years. Theory that was established by Kaku explains if fold a paper and make a hole through it you can notice the shortest distance between two points. It is said by Kaku that aliens use shortcut theory to reach the earth. Also he believes that aliens have civilizations that more advance than our civilizations.
