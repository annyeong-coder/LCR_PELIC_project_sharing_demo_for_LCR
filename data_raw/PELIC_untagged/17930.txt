We really get along with ANON_NAME_0 who is my cousin and also my friend. She is 1 year younger than me and we grow up together in Samsun which is my hometown. At the age of 18 I moved to Istanbul which is a very big and historical city in Turkey to study Law. ANON_NAME_0 moved to Bursa which is another big city in Turkey to study Economy. After she completed her education she moved to Pittsburgh to improve her English and get her master degree that is important for her future. That time I was doing my Law trainee which is required in Istanbul. After I completed it I started to work in an office as a Lawyer for a while. When ANON_NAME_0 got her master degree that is in Pittsburgh in Point Part University she moved to Istanbul to work and live. And that time I quited my job and I decided to improve my English which is really important for me and came to Pittsburgh. What a luck we love each other so much and we haven't lived together in the same city after high school. We are living in the same cities which is in different times.
