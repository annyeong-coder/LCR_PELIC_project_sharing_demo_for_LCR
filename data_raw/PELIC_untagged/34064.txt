Nowadays people have many useful devices to save time such as smart phone microwave and computer. Even though these devices help people do their work faster it causes people may want to do more works on one day. When use these saving time devices people might plan tight schedule instead of spend time on leisure activities. For instance when I was in high school I usually ate fast food which was cooked by microwave. Eating fast food saved time a lot so that I can go to more classes after school. Because of shorten my time to eat I had more time to concentrate on my school work. For this reason I think these devices bring convenient to our lives but do not help us to have more leisure time.
