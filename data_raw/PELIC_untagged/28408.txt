There are many common themes between these two essays such as love regret or second chances. In the primitive tongue of lesser species the grandfather regret his past because he was alcohol addicted and he slapped a little bothy without any reason. So he consider a new life with those lovely kids with whom he spent most of his time playing and taking care of them came to him as a second chance. In the second essay which is Grandpa's vessel the grand father was so strict so his grandsons avoid being with him. After diagnosing with mentally Alzheimer's he turned into a new personality. Instead of throwing rocks on animals he appreciate animals when he saw a cattle and consider them as holy creatures. Feeling regretful is obvious for both grandfathers especially at the end of the essays when they wept.
