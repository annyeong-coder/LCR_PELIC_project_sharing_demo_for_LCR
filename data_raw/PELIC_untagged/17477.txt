I went to Spaininlastyear with my husband. I stayed 1 week in Spain. It was first time that we were able to go throughAtlantic ocean. I decided to get there because it doesn't take time from Pittsburgh than from Japan. I took along with camera because I would like to take photos. I could see many World Heritage in Spain. I had a great experience in Spain.
