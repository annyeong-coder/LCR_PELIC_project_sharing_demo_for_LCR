ELI will prepare for a picnic next week to a awesome park. To make the picnic have a lot of fun we should get several things. We have to get a lot of water because it is very important for any picnic. In addition we need a great deal of food. We might get a little equipment that we would need during our picnic. I wish there will be a lot of students which would make the picnic more fun not few. I think we will discover several nice places during the picnic. We will play several types of sports. I think we will have much happiness.
