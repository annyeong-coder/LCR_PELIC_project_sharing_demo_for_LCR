Everyone has great many of dreams and hopes through out his life. Personally if I won the lottery and I got a lot of money I would buy a new house and a few luxury cars. Furthermore I would travel around the world and I really excited to visit some countries such as the United Kingdom France Spain and Austria. Moreover I would spend a part of the money for supporting poor peopel. However most people have different perspectives they would to be fulfilled when they got much money.
