Successful assistants Successful assistants are the persons who support the successful person. So they help him to concentrate on his goal and not to be distracted by wasting of time and energy subjects. For example the father of a successful person can play a very important role in supporting and encouraging the successful son by giving him advice and sharing experience. Thus we can say that they push the successful person forward Furthermore successful assistants are the persons who prepare a good environment for success. For instance a successful wife by helping her husband will make him happier and more relaxed reflecting on his attitude and mind for example washing and ironing his clothes preparing his food cleaning his apartment looking after his children they make him more relaxed and concentrated . Therefore successful assistants are successful persons because they create healthy environment for that successful person whom they support .
