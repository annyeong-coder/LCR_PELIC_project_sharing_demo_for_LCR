1. I used to live in the armee for two years. When I was 21 I have to go to the armee because it is a duty in my country. Many things changed and I used to work in the army but it was not easy to used to be there. 2. Today I am living in Pittsburgh and I am used to living here. I am used to the ElI Language Course. I feel very convinient and I am used to speaking english.
