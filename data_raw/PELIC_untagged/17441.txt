Learning has an appreciable effect on child's creativity. A child has an innate creativity. I think that learning needs to work on allowing child's creativity to run wild and fostering it. Over education has a bad effect on creativity. If child do the same thing over and over again it stagnates child's creativity after a while. I think important learning situation that educator shifts school education from cramming and competition to creativity and a more relaxed approach.
