My village is a wonderful view a well ventilated and a messy settlement. It is founded over mountain countryside that is a messy settlement so each house is far from another house. However transportation from my village to the cente of city is easy and it takes 20 minutes by car. My village is surrounded by forest. There are a lot of pine trees. Each pine tree produce some oxygen. So my village air is well ventilated. A lot of asthmatics come my village to recover. My village takes much rain in all seasons. The region has maist. Many plants grow over the ground such as wild gross clover and various flower. After rain I walk through our forest but the ground is a very slick. While I walk through the forest I can smell the land and d tea. They smell organic. Consequently A lot of tourists prefer to travel my village because my village has a lot of scenic beatuies. They can always eat organic produces. If you want to wake up with sun light or bird voice you can visit my village to relax.
