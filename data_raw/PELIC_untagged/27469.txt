I would like to clear up somthing in which I'm intersted in our grammar class now. I'd prefer to learn about grammar specifically because I'm confused to use Eglish grammar when I talk with people who come from other coutruies and call them up. I'd like to get through with assignment which is handed out by Peter quickly. Sometimes I feel ashamed of talking with foreign people so I hope that I take my awe away in grammar class. While I'm listening to listening part in the grammar book I want to figure out the the articles which is spoken by native speaker. Thus I will try to practice English calling Peter in the problems that bring about to me when I'm studying English!
