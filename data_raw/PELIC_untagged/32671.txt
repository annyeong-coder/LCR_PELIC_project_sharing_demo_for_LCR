Moving to a new high school is the best thing I did in my life. If I had not been punished not wearing the school uniform I would not have changed my high school. Had I not changed my high school I would not have excellent scores to apply for dental college. If I had not changed my high school I would have been a biology teacher. If I were to be a biology teacher I would have to be able to teach students. In college I was told that if I study hard I will get a scholarship. I tried my best and I got it. If I had not got a scholarship I would not seen the united states.
