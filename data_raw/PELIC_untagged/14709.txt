My father is the person who best helped me to study when I was a child. However he never did any homework for me and he never just gave me answer. He really made me think about the problem and try to find the answer by myself. When I misunderstood something and wasn't able to do my work I always asked him because I knew that he knew everything. He had me read a lot of information or he made me listen to his extensive explanation about my topic so that I could find the answer by myself. Yet the easiest way for him would have been to give me the answer directly. I remember that I had a quiz in my biology class in primary school. I knew that the material was very difficult for me. I didn't understand it and even didn't try to learn it. The last evening before the quiz when my father found out about it he explained me that everything can be learned and understood by me. He got me to try to do it. He was absolutely right! My father's advice helped me to complete high school and college with honours. His great erudition and knowledge made me learn more about everything. He let me ask him thousands of questions. He got me interested in spheres to which I used to be absolutely indifferent. It all helped me see the world as more varied. I'm happy that I have this person in my life.
