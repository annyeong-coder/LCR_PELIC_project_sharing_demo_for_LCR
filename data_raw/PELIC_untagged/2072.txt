The Success in My Life. Most people in the world have goals in their life. Some of them want to be successful in their careers academics money and relationships. All of these are goals but in my opinion if I want to be successful in my life I should to struggle to get all what I want on the right way. Some of people think if they do some things bad like steal kill and lie and no body know about what they do they think that successful in them life. There are many people help me to be successful in my life my family my husband. When I talk about my successful when I was child I really want to tell you some things. First I want to say my family is the first people I took with him. They give me advice for everything I did or I want to do it. Some time my parents were drastic with me because I did some thing bad. I that time I felt upset and angry for my parents but now I believe all that was help me to improve my behavior. Second my parents encourage me when I was in school. If I got a high grade they gave me gift or some time they promised me to go any place I wanted. I really appreciate what they did for me and I never forget that. There is some one else help me to complete my successful in my life. He is my husband. First of all he helps me how to treat with the people on a good way like how to be more polite with a bad person. Second of all he encourages me to complete my graduate for example he persuades me to take master degree in MBA or teacher English. Third of all he promotes me when I get C in my grade I know it is bad but he wants me to improve my self and try to get better than this grade. I like his method when he talks with me about successful and develop my feeling to get a top of everything I want. I thanks every one helps me to get success in my life and I am very grateful for any one kindness with me in my whole life.
