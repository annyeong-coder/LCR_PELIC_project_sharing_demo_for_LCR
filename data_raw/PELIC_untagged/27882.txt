Since the prospective hazards that might be happened from drunk people and even those people have an age enough to control with all the more reason the imminent dangers might happen to teenagers. Teens are not aware enough to discriminate good and bad things. So United States has imposed rigid rules against underage and that was under careful studies. Being in the United States for more than five months I have visited many places through the weekends and found many people who are older than 21 years old and made much violence in the public places. Those people with quite old enough doing that with greater reason teens will not have the responsibilities that let them avoid violence and dangers. However I do not agree with the current age to be lowered. If we compare the advantages and disadvantages we will notice that the negative things will get over the positive ones. Moreover most parents do not like their sons or daughters to go to bars as that will cost them too much money and may not have the ability to manage their education.
