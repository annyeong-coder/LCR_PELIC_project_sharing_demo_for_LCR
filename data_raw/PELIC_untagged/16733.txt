Beautiful and great day. Monday was the most fantastic day. First on Monday I waked up early at five o'clock. Second I went with my Libyan friends a long trip. We went to Niagara Falls. We got there at about ten A M. We have taken many of pictures. Next we went and took a boat. We were very close to the falls. It was wonderful and unforgettable moments. After that we had our lunch at after noon. Finely We back home at ten o'clock at night. We spent a great time and enjoy the day. In this unusual holiday I had unusual time. I stared with a boring day and I ended with great day. I relaxed went out took trip and did a lot of good things with my family. I wish if I could bee here next Memorial Day.
