My parents worked in a traditional market. They made Tofu and sold it. Sometimes I had to help them in the weekends or the holidays. My mother emphasized that the food was sold by fresh. After having finished the sale they often donated the food to the temples or the orphanages. My parents liked helping people so I wasn't surprised. However there was one thing that I remembered very clear. While selling we saw that a woman who took a baby stole some things from our stall. Because that wasn't the first time I saw her I was very angry and I reproved her. My mother prevented me and asked her why she stole food. The woman whose husband was sick had no money to buy food. My mother told her Don't steal if you need food just come my stall I will give you food. After this event while seeing the woman my mother always gave a lots food and some money. My parents helped many people and I haven't seen what they gain from showing compassion. Nevertheless I feel that my families are often very lucky. That is why I like sharing and helping.
