How to get an admission in the USA . At the begining I thought comming to study at the US is something very easy. And after I got my I 20 for the ELI I was so happy and I thought that I am going to get the academic admission as easy as I got the first I 20. I was totaly wrong because after I came her I knew that it's too hard to get an admission for an academic classes. Because it's not just fill out an application and submit it. It a very long process you need to have good certifecate and off corse an english proffeciancy. This is the most important thing you will need.
