I was surprised by the fact that some NFL players have played football as regular players even though they've been fighting to disease. For example David Garrard the QB of the Jaguars has had Crohn's disease. He took an operation but he still needs to go to a hospital once per 8 weeks. Jay Cutler the QB of the Broncos has had diabetes type . I don't know how he controls his blood sugar level when he plays football because I'm not familiar that how much blood sugar is needed for playing football. People having the same disease with them might have hopes that they can deal with their disease like Garrard and Cutler are doing. As for aggressive play what I like about Hines Ward is that he can tackle another player even though he is a WR. Sometimes he is charged a fine due to his stronger tackle. He's already paid the fines twice for this season. I have no idea how mush money he paid. However he said that he will never change his play style whether the NFL charges a fine for him or not.
