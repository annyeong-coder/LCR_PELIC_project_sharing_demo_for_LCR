No I don't like to have synesthesia. Why don't I like to have it. The reasons are that. First My sensation is already abnormal to contrast with normal person. Also the symptom is quite seldom diagnosed. I do something or feel something is distinct normal people. If I say something about my feeling or my illusion they perceive my behaviors are creepy. By far I get excluded by them and then I won't grin anymore.
