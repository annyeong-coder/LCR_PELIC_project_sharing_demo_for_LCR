When we have free time we usually do something we want for example hanging out with our friends going shopping or participating activities. However Fridays and Sundays have different style of spending time. By Fridays I have been busy and tired about school works. Therefore on Fridays night I can totally be relaxed. In these days I am usually hanging out with my friends. We went exhibitions which were held at a downtown went clubbing and went parties. I spend my Fridays as doing something exciting. However on Sundays because next day is Monday I should prepare for school. I should take a rest and study for next week. I stay in home and chill as well as study and do homework with my friends. Although the style is different what I think about these days off is same. When it comes Fridays I always look forward to going out and meeting my friends who I cannot meet during weekdays. We are talking about our classes and news happened during weekdays. Same thing happen on Sundays. I often study with my friends who have same class with me. We talk about our weekend and do our homework. Even though the style how to spend both days off are different I enjoy both Fridays and Sundays.
