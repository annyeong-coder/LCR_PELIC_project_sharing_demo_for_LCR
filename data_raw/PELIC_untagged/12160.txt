Similarity and Difference Between My Husband and Me Two years have passed since I marry my husband. At first I thought that we had a lot of things in common but now my thought have changed. Though we have some similarities we also have some difference in aspects of religion way to spend free time and life style such as sleeping and study habit. The first thing I compare and contrast is about religion. We both believe in God and go to church every Sunday. However we have a different preference in keeping our belief. In my case I enjoy get along with people in the church so I participate diverse communities and do lots of activities such as choir or group bible study. By joining many activities and taking with people frankly and seriously my feeling toward God is deeper and deeper. On the other hand my husband don't like spending much time to do something in the church. He just likes serving with family quietly and isn't willing to get along with other people. Secondly we actually love to rest like sleeping enough and just killing time in my house when we have free time. But after we take enough rest we have different activities. For instance I usually like to meet friend and chat together in a cafe. After taking with my friend all of my stress disappeared. In contrast my husband likes to be alone watching movie or reading comic book. He really enjoy staying alone and sometime he asks me to give only his time. Thirdly we are totally different in life style such as sleeping and study habit. While I usually get up late and fall asleep very late my husband gets up early and fall asleep very early. For this reason we got troubles when dating because it is difficult to meet exact time with each other. Conclusion. . . .
