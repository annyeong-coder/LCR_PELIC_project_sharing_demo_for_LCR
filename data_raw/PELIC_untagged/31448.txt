I want to talk about the festival which belongs to our country that called Spring festival. In that date we fire fireworks eat dumplings and watching the tv show which is the best Tv show for Chinese there are a lot of awesome artist show together. Spring festival is the most improtant festival in China it has a very long history. This is a story about Spring festival a long long ago a big scary monster called nian it always attrack people so people use the fireworks keep the monster away and that date which is the first day in Spring season it means a new start and we hope we can have a good future in the next year.
