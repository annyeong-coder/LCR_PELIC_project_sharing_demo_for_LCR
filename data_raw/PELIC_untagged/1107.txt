I believe that the prophet ANON_NAME_0 May the peace and blessings of God be upon him has been the famous person for ever because his influence has still spread for fourteen centuries after his death. Michael Hart emphasized that ANON_NAME_0 was the only man who was successful on both the religious and secular levels until his death. Since 1978 he has considered him the lead of the most influential persons 1 . Also Alphonse de LaMartaine mentioned in his book Historie de al Turquie that ANON_NAME_0 has made a huge revolution in the world for less than two centuries after he's appearance. Since then he has moved the ideas the beliefs the behaviors and has created a spiritual nationality which blends together peoples of every tongue and race 2 . Moreover the prophet ANON_NAME_0 peace be upon him was a model of practicing for democracy. Miss. Sarojini Naidu signed that Muslims have practiced the democracy for five times a day when the peasant and the king kneel side by side and proclaim God alone is great 3 . In addition I have had a reaction on my heart since I realized the value and the meaning of the last moment of the death of the Prophet ANON_NAME_0 peace be on him . For instance I have imagined for a long time that a death of the Prophet will appear kind of a spiritual worship like repeat Quran or as he prostrate for God on the pace of Habib . ANON_URLSPAGE_5.
