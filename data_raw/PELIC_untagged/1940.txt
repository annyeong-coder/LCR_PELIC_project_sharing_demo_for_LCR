But that thinking can disturb me about exert myself. If I see only good side of future I must have less effort. And keep thinking optimistic there are no improve at all. Optimism lead to satisfy anything and it's very harmful to cultivating our lives. We have to accept a negative side and pessimistic thinking. Optimism and pessimism is not problem of white or black. We can use those two things very effective.
