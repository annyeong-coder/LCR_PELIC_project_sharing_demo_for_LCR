In my mind my dream vacation is visiting to the United State. I have been thinking about visiting some famous cities such as New York Los Angeles Las Vegas and Chicago. In fact I am interested in American culture very much and I want to experience it. I have been to Pittsburgh however it is still not enough for me. If I have a vacation which is one month long I will choose New York to be my first stop. As the most flourishing city in the U. S I believe I will find the original American specific there and I will have tried the genuine hotdog and pizza. Second I will visit Chicago because I am a fan of Chicago Bulls. Third I will go to Los Angeles which has the highest Chinese population. I have been attracted by the famous food there for long time. And finally I will go to Las Vegas and have a small gamble which will be the most special experience of mine. Now I can not stop looking forward to my dream vacation!
