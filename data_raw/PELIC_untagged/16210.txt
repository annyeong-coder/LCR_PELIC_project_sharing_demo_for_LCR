My favorite Chinese myth is the legend of love. The story is about a young man named Nuilang who fall in love with a fairy girl named Zhinu. The story of Nuilang and Zhinu is considered one of the famous Chinese myths. Here is how Nuilang met Zhinu. One day seven fairy sisters bathing in a lake which is located on the south of China. Nuilang is said to have a mischievous personality. He steals their cloths and waits to see what will happen. The fairy sisters elect the youngest sister Zhinu to retrieve their clothing. It is claimed that she is the most beautiful one. Since they have been met she agrees to his request for marriage. Unfortunately the Goddess of Haven finds out that Zhinu has married a human so the Goddess forces the fairy back. Then Nuilang is very upset that she is gone. However the Goddess was touched by their love for each other. Thus decided the lovers were allowed once a year together on the seventh day of the seventh lunar month. It is called QiXi and it is also regarded as Chinese Valentine's Day. On QiXi as a day for a single girl was permitted to appear in public without a curfew in ancient times.
