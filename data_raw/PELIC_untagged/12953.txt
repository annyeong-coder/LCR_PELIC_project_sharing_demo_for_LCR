Dear Mr. President Hello Mr. President. Let me introduce myself. My name is Kyung Jong Last Name I come from Korea not the North Korea which you might dislike and I am living in Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. Also I am studying English in the ELI in University of Pittsburgh. Last week I read a special report related to marketing of tobacco companies and connection between U. S. Government agencies and them in a reading class. Therefore I would like to talk about this topic which is why I send this mail to you. First the U. S. Should not press other countries to change their trade attitudes about importing cigarette. As you know cigarette is a kind of drug. Some studies show that smoking increases a person's risk of using illegal drugs. In other word cigarette is just a legal drug comparing to heroin. How could the U. S urge other countries to buy this drug I believe that the U. S is rich to enough to not have to sell drugs like North Korea. Most importantly I must say tobacco companies marketing are threatening future human's health. Many young students can access free cigarette because of promotion of the companies in some countries. In my country a recent study shows that male teenagers begin to smoke earlier than they did three years ago. Also it constitutes one of social problems. Just now tobacco companies could make big money pay a lot of tax and create new jobs in the U. S. As adding new young customers but it will produce a contrary result as a boomerang. Eventually we will certainly pay huge money as social expenses for medical treatment for lung cancer and the patients will file a lawsuit. I hope you will reconsider this situation and decide not to support tobacco companies. If you love all children in the earth you should accept my suggestion. Also I hope you and your family will be healthy. Your Faithfully Kyung Jong Last Name
