Bill Gates has a speech Innovating to Zero in TED video. It is an ideal about decreasing CO2 to zero by inventing a new and cheap energy which is a nuclear energy produced by burning depleted Uranium. Bill's foundation is producing vaccine to help the poor and it's obvious that energy and climate are also important to those poor people because they might be impacted by worst climate and expensive price of energy. Therefore Bill brings up an idea that is making a cheap energy without producing CO2 and it was called Traveling Wave Reaction . It will use existing depleted Uranium as a fuel to produce electricity. In addition Bill's wish is to spend half cost with no CO2 get invented and he hopes that more other companies could invest it because it needs money to build a pilot reactor and also needs time to find a good location and regular rules within 40 years.
