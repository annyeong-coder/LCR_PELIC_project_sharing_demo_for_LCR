I remembered when I was in grade 5 in my drawing class. I got low score in my first drawing in class just because I didn't draw as similar pattern as my other friends. I felt that if I really use my own imagination or draw something very different from my friends I'll get a low score. On the other hand the teacher might have bias against me. From that time I acknowledge that in my drawing class I have to use the same pattern as most of my friends did. It's unbelievable that each of my drawing score is better. I felt so bad that why the teacher just use one pattern of drawing as a standard to evaluate the students work if any body wants to get good score they must follow the pattern. I still wonder that if they block our imagination or creativity how can we enhance or improve skills that we have and it's shining at that time.
