When I first got to the US I had difficulty understanding English speakers in the restaurant when I want to order from the cashier . HE often couldn't figure out what I say and I kept on to explain to him until he gives up say I didn't understand . He tried to find way to help me . Then he brought the menu to me to figure out the meal by pictures . But now I go on to learn English very well .
