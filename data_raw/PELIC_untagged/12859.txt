The article talks about how people including children worldwide are made smokers. First of all some countries such as Germany Buenos Aires Malaysia Taiwan and other show and promote their brands of cigarettes in commercials on TV and radio. Unfortunately children who give to brand stretching find habits that begin smoke everyday is easy to access to this vicious but then it is difficult to quit and they can't stop. However in some countries tobacco companies never would have gotten a start without the help of the U. S government. Also tobacco advertising of these countries and other are more pervasive than in the U. S. In addition in U. S cigarettes are considered a sign of style and sophistication as well it focuses heavily on U. S lifestyles. Consequently the U. S has been influenced country for other countries for example before the U. S arrived companies smoking people were declining in Japan but in the past five years smoking people increased in a high percentage. In conclusion right now this vicious has been influenced in many people but the world is concerned that everyday children and teenagers are the most smokers and deaths are more in them. I think that nowadays people don't have conscience about the damage to consume tobacco but I'm concerned is that it is most of the cases people don't try to quit and do you know why Because of laziness. Therefore when people decide to quit the consume cigarette it is too late because it is difficult to stop and after one day they start again. In addition it is a stupid thing that the most of teenagers smoke just because right now is a trend in the society. In conclusion I disagree with cigarette consumption. First it is totally disgusting the smell it left in the mouth hands and clothes. Second it is not at all a trend. Third it is the most important thing people must take care their health.
