Saturday night I went to Law's theater to watch Law Abiding Citizen movie which stars Gerard Butler as Clyde Shelton the story is about a man who is forced to witness the murder of his wife and daughter. A few years later the killers been caught. The federal agent who handled the case said there is not enough evidence to convict both murderers so he made a deal with one of the men where he will be charged with third degree murder and he will be released in five years. This does not sit well with Clyde who wants the murders to be feel the pain that they caused to him therefore he planned to take the justice by himself and threat everybody who was connected to the release of his family's murder.
