My father had a great talent for drawing and painting. Painting is also one of my favorite hobbies. He let me go to good university which I want to go. Therefore I left school and went to a college of fine art. I used to go out to sketch with my friends on sunday in my school days. He wanted me to be a painter after get my diploma but didn't make me keep drawing. I felt need to change my major because I thought that I wasn't gifted in painting by that time
