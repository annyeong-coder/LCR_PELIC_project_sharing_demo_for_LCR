From my point of view an acquaintance is who I know but who is not a close friend. For example the person who I meet every morning when I was waiting for the bus to go to school is an acquaintance. We say good morning to each other but don't talk in depth. In contrast to an acquaintance best friend is a person who I trust and who I talk about my private thoughts to. I would like to share my feelings with my best friend who I rely on soundly. A best friend is who I will miss for a lengthy separation. Finally that would be easy to define a friend. A person who I know is not like an acquaintance and a best friend who is a friend. People whose interests and hobbies are the same with me may become my friends. Sometimes when I talked to a friend who has similar thought with me we would become the best friends gradually.
