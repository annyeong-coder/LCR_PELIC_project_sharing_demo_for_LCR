I think the family and friends are two important parts in my life. If I hadn't been born my younger brother would have felt lonely because no one can accompany with him. In the family I usually do the housework for my family. If I hadn't been in the family my parents would have felt tired. They need to use their free time to do the housework. Besides that I would have felt very pity if I hadn't been born in this family. Because I have a lovely family and it's lucky to be my parent's child. I like to make friends in my life. If I hadn't made friends I would have stayed at home all day and I would have felt very boring. However if my friend hadn't had me they would have felt boring too. Because all of them said it's interesting to talk with me. I'm glad I was born and I really enjoy the life I have right now!
