My brother called me when I had class then I asked him to called me back because I had class. After three minutes he called me again then I picked up his call and told him I have class now could you call me later. After ten minutes he called me then I picked up his call then he asked me what is the bast restaurant in downtown . I hang up his call. When I finished my class I call him and I told him about the best restaurant in downtown. He talked me into have dinner there. We got on bus 71 to go restaurant. Then we got off infront of restaurant. We had dinner there. We found out the restaurant was very cheap comparing with other restaurants.
