My Life Between Past And Today I was born 1986. I used to meet my mother everyday. I used to play football with my friends now I can't play football. I used to visit my grandfather every week. Also in the past I graduated from King ANON_NAME_0 University in 2008. I used to assist my father in his garden. Today I am living in pittsburgh . I study English in ELI and get alot of informations and skills during classes . I wake up everyday at 7 00 and I start to eat my breakfast . I take a bus to dawntown and I arrive to Oklland at 8 50 am. Now I am student and I hope to get a good grades when I finish this year. My objective in this class is to improve my skills in grammer and increase my ability to use this skills during speak. Now I must be focus on my study rather than before and find the big benefit of learning the English. Always My friend visits me and we go to resturant and eat amarican food .
