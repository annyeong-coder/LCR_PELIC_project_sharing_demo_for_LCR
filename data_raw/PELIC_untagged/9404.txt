Last week I went to a shop which was located on Forbes Avenue. When I was parking my car on Forbes Avenue my car was overtaken passed by one blue car running at speed. At that time I felt the shock and saw something dropping down from the side mirror. It was clear that my car was hit by the car and the part of the side mirror was broken. I immediately got off my car and tried to watch the car number and the type of the blue car although there was some distance from me. However no information was left after the car disappeared. Suddenly I was talked to by a man who saw the accident behind me. I was glad because that evil car was being seen by someone else while I was parking my car. He told me that the blue car was Ford. Fortunately the car number of the blue car was written down by the kind man! I could get information about the car if I give the car number to the police! However the car has not been found. Police didn't help me to find the car that hit my car when I reported the accident to them with the car number. They could have thought that it was too trivial to deal with. In addition the cost to repair the side mirror was not covered by my car insurance. That is why I have been being depressed these days.
