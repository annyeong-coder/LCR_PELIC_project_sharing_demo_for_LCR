When I went back home to see my family I got a phone call on my cell phone from unknown number. I picked up the phone but I couldn't figure out who was that. The voice was familiar for me so I told her hold on because I was trying to ask my sister about that phone number. Unfortunately she did not know the number so I kept on talking with her to help me to remember who was that. While we were talking I found out that she was my cousin as I heard my uncle's voice talking beside her. At that time I told her the truth and she said it was good that the call ended up by knowing me and you didn't hang up on me because it was clear that you were confused. After we had finished the call I went over my contact list and I found out that I lost many numbers.
