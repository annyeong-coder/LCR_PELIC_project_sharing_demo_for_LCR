When I was a young I usually thought that I shouldn't have done something. At that time I didn't have any idea abut the future. So I was afraid and wondered everything. Nowadays I also repeat these situations. For example when I meet someone who is native in USA I can't speak English very well even I hear very familiar wards. I ought to have spoken more confident attitude or I might have chosen more specific sentence. I always might regret my behavior.
