What made me laugh was a Chinese man who is a fellow of my husband. My family went to my husband's office last Sunday. While my husband worked for his office my son David and I were waiting for him at the break room. After a while a Chinese man came to the break room and he was lying on his face on the table. I thought that he must have been tired and David and I were reading books quietly. A little later he talked loudly a few words to us but we did not know what he was saying for his talking in Chinese. And David asked to him what he meant. And then he was lying on his face on the table again without any answers. We realized that he was talking in his sleep at that time. Oh man!!!
