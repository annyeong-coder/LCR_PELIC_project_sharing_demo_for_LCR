You SHOULD change your life style for your family. First you HAVE TO find job. You are adept at cooking so you HAD BETTER be a cooking assistant. Next you MUST exercise to reduse your stress. And you MUST lose your weight. Also you SHOULDN'T be angly easily to your family and friends. Finally you HAD BETTER quit smoking so you MUST live longer to your family. You DON'T HAVE TO continue doing current your life style.
