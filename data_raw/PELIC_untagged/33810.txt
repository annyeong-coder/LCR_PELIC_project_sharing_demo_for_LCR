2 I lived with my parents and my sliblings who you've met. 3 I had two sisters and an older brother who I felt a close connection to them. 4 My sisters and I shared a room where we spent nights talking there. 5 My brother slept on the living room couch where I hardly ever saw him. 6 It was a large old couch which my father had made. 7 My best friend lived across the hall where I loved her family. 8 We went to the same school where we both studied English there. 9 Mr. Robinson was our English teacher who everyone was a little afraid of. 10 After school I worked in a backery where my aunt and auncle owned. 11 They sold delicious bread and cake which people stood in line for hours to buy. 12 My brother and sisters live far away now where I mess them. 13 When we get together we talk about the old days when we all lived at home then.
