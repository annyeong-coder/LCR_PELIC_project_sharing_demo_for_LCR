I met my bestfriend when I worked at seafood steak restaurant called Sizzler. I worked about 10 hours a day as a waiter. My bestfriend was waitress. Our main job was serving in a hall cashier working at the front desk and washing dishes at the kitchen. We always worked together and after the work we went home together. While we were going home we talked a lot. When we were talking about her ex boyfriend we felt like we were soulmate. Though I came here pittsburgh still we are bestfriend and I miss her.
