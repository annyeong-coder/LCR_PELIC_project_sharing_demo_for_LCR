Shedd Aquarium is my favorite place of this tour. There are more than 1000 kinds of marine life and they include three parts of levels which have different topics of animals. Each levels also have lots of interesting performance and educational learning so you can learn and take many information about marine life that you had never knew. For example there is a Waters of the World area which contain many kinds of fishes and plants from ocean like Tropical Octopus and Anemones and they have excellent in both pictures and information. Then there is a Oceanarium area where they have marine mammal presentation with Dolphins Whales and Penguins and I felt it was very interesting and exciting. There is a 4 D Special FX Theater where they screen 4 D movies about Benthos and I think it's the great of my special experience. And there are another programs like habitat chats dive presentations kid's activities and more. There are three restaurants of food services which provide delicious and health foods. They also sell many kinds of mementos in the Shedd Aquarium Store where you could buy many products that have shapes of marine life. They are fun and cute. Maybe they will let you remember those cheerful memory when you see them again. It's easy to see why I feel it is my favorite place of this tour and it's let me have the most wonderful experience.
