My dream destination is Indonesia. It is located in southeast of Asia. It consists of many islands. The largest island is called Sumatra then Java which is the most populated island in Indonesia. It has nice weather especially in summer. Also it has brilliant nature and culture. The beaches in Bali and Mount Rinjani in Lombok are popular scenic destinations. Indonesia has a lot of festivals that attract tourists. The most important reason that I choose Indonesia is the costs. Travelling to Indonesia and living there are cheap compared to other countries.
