Feb 07 2009 Teresa My sister and I There is a friend I know in twenty five years she is so close with me. We usually hang out and sleep together. If she has a trouble I always love to help her. We take care of each other. She is my friend my little sister. Moreover we have the same interests such as mountain hiking shopping. Although we have similar noses and mouths there are differences in eyes and personality. On weekends we like to go mountain hiking it's our common hobby. We like to breathe fresh air instead of dirty air in city to sit on a bench to see view below us. Sometimes we go shopping together we like to give each other's suggestion in outfit. I choose clothes for her she chooses it for me. Even we share clothes shoes and purses. In appearance both of us have the straight noses and small mouths. Strangers feel we are sisters in these features. Even though we look similarly she has double fold eyelids I have single edged eyelids. Beside of this her personality is introvert and mine is extrovert. I like to make friends but she prefers to be alone. That is the reason that she is independent and I am not I always depend on her and my friends. Lots things has happened to us we have laughed together and have cried together. We have shared everything to each other. When she needs to be inspired I am there. I need someone to talk she opens ears. We will go thought more and more things in the future I believe we will have lots stories between us.
