I haven't seen my cousin since two years ago. Because he has lived in other city since he got a new job there. I have studied architecture for five years. Since that time I have loved this major. Also I have worked with Princess Nora University for 5 years as a part time. I have already written my C. V but I haven't sent it yet. I haven't bought a new car yet. I have already gotten the money.
