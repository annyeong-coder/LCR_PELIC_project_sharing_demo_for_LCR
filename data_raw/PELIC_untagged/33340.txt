I think the Village's life is good. People seems that they don't get any stress and feel lonely. They spend time dancing and golfing. They enjoy their life without worries. I want to live in a similar community when I am a senior citizen. Because if I live at the Village I can go to hospital easily when I am sick or near death. Also I can enjoy many fun things in my village. So from my perspective living in the Village when I become a senior citizen is good.
