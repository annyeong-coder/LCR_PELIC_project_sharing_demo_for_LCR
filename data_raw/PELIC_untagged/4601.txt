In my opinion is hard to quantified in what way someone have been important to you or how that person influenced your life. Probably I have been most influenced by a former teacher that I have. I was taught by him how to choose in life and what to choose. When I met him my values were already formed because I was old enough for that but I still think that he was the one who influenced me the most. I am still insiperd by him especially by the way he is used to handle things that came into his life and also by the way he talks with patients. His influence will be seen in my future professional life as a dentist and most likely he'll always be remembered by me for his advises.
