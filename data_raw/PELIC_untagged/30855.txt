Fridays and Sundays Despite the fact that there are a lot of people prefer Fridays there are many prefer Sundays. In fact there are some of similarities and differences between these days depending on people and their activities and cultures. Actually the situation in my own country is totally different because we have Thursdays and Fridays as a weekend. Now I am living in the United States and the weekend here is Saturdays and Sundays. Initially Fridays for me as a Muslim is a holy day. All Muslims should go to the mosque five times everyday if they can and it must be go to mosque on Fridays to pray ALJUMAH. We should come early to mosque and concentrate to the speech so we should wake up early on the contrary you can sleep to late hours in Sunday morning. Furthermore Friday is the last day of the workweek while Sunday is one day before the new week. It is obvious that people feel free on Fridays. Usually I go to coffee shops restaurants and sport clubs to entertain my self and have fun. I stay awake until late hours. It is Friday! On the other hand I feel tired and disappointed on Sunday because I organize my next week's schedule arrange my appointments and tasks study for exams and do homework. Also I help my wife and teach my sons on Sunday. Really Sunday is a busy day. Finally I spend a period of time with my family on Friday just as I do on Sunday. Not only Fridays is my favorite day but also Saturday. Indeed both Friday and Sunday are the days in which I do chores and run errands.
