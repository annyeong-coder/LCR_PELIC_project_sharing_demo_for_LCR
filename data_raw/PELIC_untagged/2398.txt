Success The word success has a lot of definitions. Many people think that success is related to relationships careers or money. Other people say it is about prizes and awards. Some books have another meaning for success such as reaching goals a perfect event or good luck in life. According to my mother success is when my brother get marry and start a family. Success in my definition is to get what you plan for. For example I plan for a scholarship and so after ten years I get it. However my friend says it's achieving your goal such as pursuing a degree in another country. On the other hand my wife says if you want to feel great you must work for your goals. For instance she felt so great when she finished her Bachelor's degree because she was the only one in her family that achieves it. All this thoughts from friends family and others are not the same. I think the differences how we understand success. My friends see that when I got my scholarship it was success but for me the big success is when my I get my PHD degree.
