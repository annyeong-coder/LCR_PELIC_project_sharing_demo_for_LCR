I was not good at study in middle school especially in math. I was interested in art but that is not the main subject for entrance examination. Due to this reason my parents force me to give up learning painting and pay attention to study hard. Although I do not like this decision but I have no choice. After I pass the exam I try to restart to painting but I think I already lose a lot of passion that times go by. If my parents supported me to painting maybe I am a good painter right now.
