I inclined to start a business in an unconventional way. A conventional way seems to be easy and can make money a lot but it has a limits and period which you can make a profit is shorter than unconventional way. I think unconventional way has more opportunities and incentives in a long term. It may be challenge and hard to success and sometimes you have to face many problems. Such as your products that you invent have side effects not as attractive as you imagine etc. However if you overcome problems and persist it you can make a lot of profit. I go along with her opinion which business has to contribute to socially responsible. Also it has advantage both company and consumer because it can enhance brand image. And I want to follow identical ways. Maybe it depends on situation and what kind of business I want. However I will use correspond ways. Especially I really like campaign. It is not just products or brand advertisement but campaign advertisement such as building houses for poor people protecting natural environment. She did not advertise her company but I think campaigns also have effects of advertisements because it enhances brand images. For this reason I will campaign at foreign countries which I export my goods.
