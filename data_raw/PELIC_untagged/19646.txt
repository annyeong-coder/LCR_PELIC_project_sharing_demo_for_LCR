Some of them I will give it as charity. I will spend a great deal of the money on myself. I will buy a now house has a lot of trees and plenty of flowers. The rest of the money I will spend most of it on a new car. Yet it is difficult because every car store has several kinds of beautiful cars. However few days ago I saw an amazing car on the Toyota store in the north side. I will try to get a couple of them with different color. The last of the money I will spend it on traveling. I will have visited as much as countries by the next year. Finally I will enjoy my life with lots of delectation.
