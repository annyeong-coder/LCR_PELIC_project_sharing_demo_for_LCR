It is hard to tell exactly which type of personality I am. However I believe I am more like an introvert than an extrovert. Everyone who knows me better said that I am a talkative person. In fact every time when I go to a place where many people gather together like the ELI night I become very quiet. Usually there is always someone who likes to share his or her opinion and experience. At the time I will become a listener. Also in some situation even though there are only a few people I do not always talk a lot. Only when I am with some people whom I would like to talk to I am not mute. Maybe that is why my best friends think that I am not an introvert because I am always noisy in front of them.
