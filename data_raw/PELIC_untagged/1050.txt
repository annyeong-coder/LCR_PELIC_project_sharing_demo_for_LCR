My friend has known me since 1997. She has had same class with me many times for 6 years because she has been in same school with me for 6 years. She has studied about education in the elementary school since she went the university. She has had experience of teaching children for 5 months. She has also studied Chinese for 3 years and she is going to China for studying next year. She has been a member of group in her university for 4 months. She is so excited about the group because it's a dancing group so she can get fun.
