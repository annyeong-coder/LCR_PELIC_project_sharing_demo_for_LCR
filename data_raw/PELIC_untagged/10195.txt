The most interesting experience I've ever had with money was about five years ago when I was a high school student. One day I took a bus to visit a friend of mine. When I was about get off the bus I saw something small on the seat beside me. It was a child's wallet. I opened it and found much money in it. I hesitated about returning the wallet for a moment however I decided to call to the number on the paper that was in the wallet. I could meet a woman who was the mother of the child that lost the wallet and returned it. The woman thanked me so much and then said that the money in the wallet was fake. Then I realized that it was just toy money which is like fake money in Monopoly and the child always carried it because he was so young. I couldn't help laughing out loud after knowing the fact. I really thought over that I was going to keep it for a minute and after then I've returned something people lost without hesitating whenever I fing it.
