All county have own traditional music clothes and dance. They all show that country's culture and history. I think Mongolian traditional music is a great and lovely. Maybe people ask me why I will say because Mongolian songs are made by history and wild nature. Before the great Chinggis khaan Mongolian people wasn't have own letter so but they all knew the all history by song and stores. Mongolian songs tell about history love and wild nature. Mongolian traditional music had 2 parts huumii urtiin duu and usually use one instrument. Mongolian traditional instrument is a morin huur. Horin huur's hade looks like horse hade and some part made by horse's tail. The sound is a most massing thing sound like horse. I think Mongolian old generation was a genius people but now not mach. Huumii is a strong sound the all singers are man because huumiis sound essential from mans sound. Huumii sing about native country love story and history. My grandfather is father was a huumii singer. My grandfather told me his father was a great singer his sound can fix the mother and child's break in my country some camel don't like the own child and he usually sing in most celebration. My grandfather told me his father one time he sings then camel was crying that moment most memorable thing. Urtiin duu means long song only singers are female. Urtiin duu sing about usually native country and love. Singer need good to hold the breath because long song sing in one breath. This movie will show the mongolian traditional music powerThe Story of the Weeping Camel
