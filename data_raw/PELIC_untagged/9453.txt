I am from Taichung which is one of the cities in Taiwan. My name is Student's Name and my friends called me Horace. I am an easy going talkative and hard working person. I like to talk to other people in order to gather any kinds of information. For outdoor activities I enjoy playing sports especially baseball and table tennis.
