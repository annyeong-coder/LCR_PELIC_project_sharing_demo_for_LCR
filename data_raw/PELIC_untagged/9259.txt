It is easy to recognize my cousin after I tell about his general appearance. First of all he is the tallest membership of my family and because he always do exercise such as going to the gym playing basketball swimming running and so on he has a very athletic body. Then he always has short hair. Also I always call him big man because he is strapping. However he sometimes faces some problem because of his body size. For example when he likes a jacket sweater or other kind of clothes sometime he can't find one that fits. Especially he faces this problem when looking for a shoe because he has very big feet. As you see you can easily know him after talking about his physical appearance. Also you can distinguish him from other people by looking his personality. He has a unique personality when we compare him to other members of my family. First of all he is a very considerate person. Because he is always straightforward it is very difficult to misunderstand him. Because he has an open mind even he has some wrong ideas I believe that he can correct them. Also he is a very brave person that I can trust without doupting. To sum up my cousin whose name is Ugur has different personal and physical features that help us to know him easily.
