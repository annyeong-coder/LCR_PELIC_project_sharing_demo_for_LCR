If Tom Brady didn't get injury Patriots would clinch their division. If Patriots had won the Super Bowl against Giants they would have had a perfect season. If Brett Favre hadn't joined Jets Chad Pennington wouldn't have moved to Dolphins. If Michael Vick hadn't abused dogs he would play in Falcons. If Iverson hadn't been treaded I would have seen him. If I were a boy I would train hard to be a CB. I wish Steelers had been beaten by Chargers. If I didn't come to America I wouldn't know American football. If only Sean Taylor hadn't stayed at home he wouldn't have been killed. I wish a football season would be a little longer.
