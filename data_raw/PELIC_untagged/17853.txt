This picture is about my older son's 9th birthday party. I like these kids so I picked this one. The girl who was wearing a crown was a birthday girl. But a funny thing was that this party wasn't for her it was for my son. She was a birthday girl at the another party which was held at the same time. When we took this picture she was passing through. The boy who was opening a big mouth making faces was this party's birthday boy my older son. He had been attended many of his friends' birthday party. So he asked my husband and I to give him a birthday party. We thought over then agreed. Obviously the guy who was wearing a pair of glasses is my husband. The lady who was touching on a boy's shoulder is me. The clown who was standing in the middle was the party actor. Since he sang danced made the children more active all of them had a good time there.
