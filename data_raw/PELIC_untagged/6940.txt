I thing the telemarketing call will lead me to be crazy. They have kept on calling me at any time. Once when I was sleeping the telephone rang and I woke up. I picked the phone up. It was the telemarketing call and immediately I hung up. Unfortunately he called me back this kind of telemarketing people never gave up. I answered again and he said hold on please don't hang up the phone. He said he had a great over to me about your trip to California and he wanted me to think over about the idea that he offered to me and he was talking me into his ideas. Finally I went over his offer but I didn't sign up and I said to him talk my name off from your list and never ever call me back.
