Chunmin is my good friend whom I met in ELS class. In the first sight I didn't think that we would be good friends because she is from Taiwan and I am from the mainland China. One day I was surprised to find that Chunmin who could understand my hometown's dialect. Then I knew her story that she grew up in Taiwan but was born in Wuhan which is my hometown. Her mother whose hometown was Wuhan brought her to Taiwan to together with her father when she was three. After that we have become more and more familiar.
