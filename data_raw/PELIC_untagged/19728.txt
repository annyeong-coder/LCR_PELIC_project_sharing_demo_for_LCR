I think the internet is not a good place to meet a romantic partner. First of all you can't be sure that everyone is honest online. Second there are so many people make friends online because they have social relationship problems. In addition some people are involved in their internet world too much and result in forgetting their responsibility in real life. In conclusion although meeting a romantic partner online might happen you should pay more attention to understand your friends.
