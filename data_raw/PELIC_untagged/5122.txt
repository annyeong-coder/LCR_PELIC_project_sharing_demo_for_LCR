I was not interested in photography about 2years ago. However I've interested in photography from the last year. Then I bought a good camera. I have been attending many photography classb for a year. Because this camera makes good photo I've been taking this in everywhere. When I was in KOREA I used to take a picture of my family and friends. After I came here I have been taking picture of my acquaintances. I also have been keeping their pictures. In additional if I take a picture I have been sending my pictures to my family and friends.
