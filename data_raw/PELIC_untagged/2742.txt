Cultural Expectations of Success There are different cultural expectations of success for males and females. In the traditional Eastern culture success for men usually means power and a successful career success for women usually means taking care of her children and doing housework. In modern society no matter Eastern or Western power and a successsful career are the mark of a successful man. Many higher positions of the government and a lot of international companies Chief Executive Officers CEOs are men. Many important decisions no matter domestic or international private or public are usually made by men. This situation has existed for many centuries. From the growth of a boy into a man our traditional Eastern culture mandates that male should be strong and powerful. Although there are many reasons I believe this is the result of our cultural expectations. Cultural expectations also influence the role of women. On the other hand a successful woman usually takes care of her children helps them grow healthy and manages a home in a regular manner. Taking care of children is the main responsibility for women. If a child grows up with some achievements we usually say that the mother has succeeded. Our culture influences the growth of a girl into a woman it's just the similar as that of a boy into a man. Historically our cultural mandates that women usually stay at home. As a result women play a small role in society. Although a few successful women hold higher positions in the government and a few women are CEOs the majority of important positions are held by men. Many examples can show that men and women usually succeed in different aspects. This is the influence of cultural expectations of success for males and females.
