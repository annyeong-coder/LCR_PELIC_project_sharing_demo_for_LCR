How I met my wife I didn't know her before and I never talk to her but I had been friend with her two brothers who's older than her. One time I was talking with her brother about getting married and he said to me that he has a sister and I was joked with hem but the subject get seriously and I have promised him that I will met with him when I go back to the Saudi Arabia. Relay when I go back to my country I met him and also my mother and sister and one of my ant met with his family and her. Then they came to me and told me about her everything how she looks like and her manor. After that I diced to get married from her. I talked to my father and my mother and we went to her family and asked her father to get married from his daughter. After three day's they recall me and they give me the answer. Two day's latter we arrange everything ready to celebrated and I don't believed that I will get married finally. Every body was happy to me especially my parents who were with me and they helped me a lot. Also I never forgot her tow brothers who were helping me too. Everything was good and perfect and I love her very much. She is very nice and cute lady and I am happy that everyone in my family loves her too. Right now we are waiting this term to finish and I will go back to my country to make the big celebration and get married and make everything ready to come back to the U. S to complete our own live together.
