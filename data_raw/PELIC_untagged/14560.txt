Then told me ANON_NAME_0 a current ELI student about what do the students think are the strengths of the ELI he said It has good teachers the classes are very small and it helps me to contact my teachers the ELI is located in Pittsburgh and it has good benefits. Moreover the students recommend the ELI to other students because It has strong program and has many advantage Hanan Elajaili said. In fact many students like the ELI at Pitt over other schools consolidate that ANON_NAME_1 a current ELI student said Because the ELI has five classes every day and other schools don't have this system they also have many activities and I find many people to help me in this institute.
