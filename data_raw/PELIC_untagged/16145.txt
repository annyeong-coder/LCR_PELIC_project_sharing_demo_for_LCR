One day I have a party at my apartment. It's funny that everyone got drunk. I'm not sure how much we drank at that night. What makes me laugh is one of my friends he pushed up all night. The fact that he pushed up all night was he used to be a military. He thought that he was training. I'm happy that everyone have fun at that night. Whenever I have parties is fun for me. I think that I want to have a party every weekend.
