Stress comes from everywhere. Not only adults feel it but also children. Dr Gautamadas quoted a recent survey and he said The perception of stress increases with age along with the urge to perform. And stress has a negative impact on performance. So it is a vicious circle. Adults feel stress because of the work family. Children or teenagers feel stress because of school homework lots of tests or parents ask high grades. But how to release the stress and help relax. Here I have some ways. First watch a comedy. When I feel stress I sometimes watch a comedy. With watching it I laugh loudly. Meanwhile I temporary forget the stress and the things which bothered me. After I watch a comedy I feel much better. Although I still have solved the problem I feel I have energy to fight these problem and stress. Second sometimes I go to a beach. I love the blue sea and the sky. When I see the sky and the sea I feel very comfortable and it just like takes away most of my stress. I always walking at on the beach to help me relaxing too. The thing I do but not usually at the beach is shout loudly. Shout at the beach is relaxing because it is very spacious and won't bother any person. Last one I think is the most useful one. Talk to my family or friends. When I talk to my family and friends or spend time together they always provide some solutions or tell me what is the problem. After the talking I also feel relax. This is the way I always choose to release my stress. There are still more other way to release stress. Through these ways you can feel much better about the stress and have more energy to do everything. It is not so difficult. So don't feel upset the stress come. Just choose the way you like best and fight the stress!
