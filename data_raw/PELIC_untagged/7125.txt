The best mirror is an old friend which is the famous definition for an honest friend given by George Herbert. Herbert's words perfectly match the concept of good friends in Chinese that are friends who are willing to tell you the true friends who understand your stance and friends who are erudite. It seems that the eastern and the western wise men have similar perspectives about a good friend. Actually in my life I can find friends like these. One of my friends whose name called Broken Fish is a friend who is definitely willing to reach his hand when I am in trouble. One time I remembered that I called him at almost down to seek help while I was trapping by car accident. A person like him is really a friend whose friendship needs to be cherished in my life and I think I will.
