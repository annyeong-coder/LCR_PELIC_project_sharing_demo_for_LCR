Thursday's balloon incident which captivated the whole nation was emerged to be a hoax. The six years old boy who was thought to be trapped in the flyer saucer like balloon was found in his house later. His parents who were featured twice on ABC Wife Swap are amateur scientists. Instead of admitting their purpose which was to follow a trend toward getting a reality TV show the parents attempted to justify their attentions as an accident. Authorities say that the parents will be charged and a new framework for avoiding the same thing happen again is considered.
