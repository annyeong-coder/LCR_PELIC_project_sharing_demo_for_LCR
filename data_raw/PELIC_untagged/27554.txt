When I came back from my vacation my room was so depressing. I realized that I should have set it up better before I had left. Actually I spent three days trying to figure out how to make it much better. I looked up on the internet but I could not figure out how to enhance my room. Last but not least my friend visited me and asked me what was going on. While I told him the story he came up with a great idea. We had been working on it for 5 days. Now when I go back to my room I feel more comfortable. Do you like to know why In other words would you like to know what my friend's idea was This is the answer. His idea started with throwing away all unwanted things. Then we turned my desk around which gave me more available space in my room. After that he hung up three fabulous pictures of my grammar classmates and our teacher. In addition he gave me a present which is a remote control that is used to turn on as well as turn off the light with a convenient way. Moreover this remote is able to turn up and turn down the volume whether TV or radio. Now I appreciate inviting my girlfriend to sit down in my room. Finally I picked up a gorgeous bed sheet which makes my room shinier. Honestly I have been dreaming of having such a fascinating room since I was a little kid. Today my room cheers me up when I come home.
