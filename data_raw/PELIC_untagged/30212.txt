The entertainment is one of important things for me in my life. How I can usually use positive mood to do my work is depending on the entertainment I have. There are three types of recreation that I like the most playing basketball reading books and watching movies. First of all I enjoy playing basketball when I have free times. Playing basketball is not only pleasant but also healthy for me. For instance when I play with my friends I can take care of my friends who already have not seen for a long time. Furthermore I can improve my basketball skill through playing the games with my friends and this really makes me pleasant and puts me in to good mood. And doing exercise is helpful for my health so I love to play basketball. What is more I like reading books iwhen I feel bored. I usually go to bookstores and find a book about science fiction. Then I can spend my whole day reading the book.

Besides reading books can learn a lot of knowledge that I never know and let my disposition be better. Therefore reading books is one of the entertainments I love. Third I prefer to watch the movies in my free time. When I go to the movies I can hang out with my friends and improve our relationships. Moreover I can enjoy the sound effects and watch the large screen. I love the tremendous scene and I only can feel it when I watch the movies. In addition to when I watch movies I can see the sexy girl in the movies and imagine that I am a leading character and then I can hang out with her. So I really enjoy watching the movies.
