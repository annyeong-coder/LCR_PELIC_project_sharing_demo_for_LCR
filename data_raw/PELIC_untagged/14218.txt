Every one has a friend who is close to him. In my case I have my friend'Haithem who is really close to me and he is like brother. We traveled for different countries together except the United States which is his favorite country as me. Both of us have almost the same personality and thoughts that make us good friends. Both of us live in forign countries to study English that is helpful for our careers. The thing that I don't like on him is very shy. For example I like to go to a big parties that let me meet new people but he does not.
