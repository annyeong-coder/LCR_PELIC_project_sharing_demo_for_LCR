Hello my name is ANON_NAME_0. This name matches our prophet name ANON_NAME_0 peace be upon him. I have no nickname so my friends call me ANON_NAME_0. I just moved to Pittsburgh 6 weeks ago to study English and later on to get my degree in physical therapy. Now I am living in somewhere called Highland Park. It is a nice place. I wake up every day to go to school. I have one day off which is Wednesday. On this day I do my household chores and study. We also have the weekends that everybody hangs out in. I live with my host in a big house. He goes to the church every Sunday and I go to the mosque every Friday. My favorit hoppy is dancing salsa. There many places to dance on latin music in Pittsburgh but I like to go to only 2 of them. Tusca is the first and Altar bar is the other. Not only dancing I enjoy but I like to watch people dancing.
