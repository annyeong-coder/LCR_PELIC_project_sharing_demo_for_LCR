The activity what I did last class. In last writing class I was studying about what teacher gave me some web sites. There were various grammars linking to the Web sites. I have a shortage of the article and proposition. I could not study all grammars what teacher gave on the internet. First I looked up the adjective clause. It was easy for me to how to make a sentence and how to adjust on my words so I answered to some questions on the web site quickly. However I can make more complexly sentences such a proposition with using an adjective clause. It is so difficult for me when and how I should use. When I try to use the proposition with using the adjective clause I am confused and embarrassed so I have to practice it more and more. Next I looked up a preposition. I think people who is studying English have a trouble with it. It is the most difficult in English. If people understand how to use it exactly they will be almost native speakers. When I talk or speak to someone I am always thinking about a grammar how to make a sentence. Especially I think too much how to make the sentence. That is why I usually get embarrassed and cannot continuously talk to someone. Anyway I think the Web sites are usually for me to practice and to make sure what I know.
