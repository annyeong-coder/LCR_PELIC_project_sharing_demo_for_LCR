Welcome to the Hwasoo's place. I have lived in Pittsburgh in the States since last August. Since then I've been learning English here in Pittsburgh. I've made a couple of folders to make a personal record that includes what I've been doing here. The first folder is about my travel in the States. The second one is everyday life in Pittsburgh. Doesn't it sound enjoyable The first folder involves lots of essays and pictures. New York city DC and Chicago are the places I visited before. As you will see there are many pictures I took everywhere I've gone. You can feel the city with my pictures at second hand. Also you can see how entertaining Pittsburgh is with the pictures in the second folder. The pictures of parties soccer game studying at the ELI with a lot of friends who are from all over the world are included. You may even want to come to Pittsburgh because of the pictures. Hopefully have look at them joyfully.
