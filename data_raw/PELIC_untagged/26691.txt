I think one of the most important thing is relationship with friends. I met my best friend in my high school. I was afraid of starting new school. So on the first day at high school I was sitting on my seat. When I was sitting someone who is my best friend now said to me hello. After talking with her I felt comfortable. I studied with her and I talked with her while getting to know each other.
