I think that our best mirror is our old friends who know lots of things about us. We have spent time doing many things with old friens. When I was in high school I had a friend who is In June whose personality was timidity. The other side I was large hearted. One day We had a test which was very important. Even though He had been nervous before we took the test he did't tell me his feeling. However I could know that he was nervous. He has a habit that I knew when he was nervous. Also he shaked his legs that was very short. There is a reason why I could know that he was nervous. The reason that I have got along with him since I was 6 years old. I think that our best mirror that we can examine ourselves is our old friens who is important in our life.
