There are several Pointers that I would give a new ELI student who want to succeed in learning English. First he should do of his homework because homework helps you learn. Second you must go to every class because class helps you with pronunciation. Third you should try to make an American friend. Finally you should always choose to study at a college that appeals to you because it difficult to transfer schools.
