Two heads are better than one. I agree with this talk. Sometimes I have a little trouble in my life but I can not solve problems by myself so I need other people's help. For example I often talked with my husband about the problems of my work before because I wasn't able to fine a way out of when I met with the difficult thing. He always told me his ideas as an outsider then showed me the better way to solve it. I think his advice is very important for me. These experiences let me know what is Two heads are better than one.
