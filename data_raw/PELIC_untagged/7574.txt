I have no child yet but some times I wonder that how to educate my child when I have a child. The child s mentality grows up gradually being affected by other people. It is needless to say that family especially parents plays an important role in child mental development. But when children grow up an became young adults who get already some degree of sociality who is a person who can affect their opinion mostly Family seems to be important to make young adults personality because they spend most of their time with their children. But the children always have some term in which they always against authority parents teacher. From my experience in this term children never listen their family's advise. When they became adults and begin to work and experience various socials issue they must know the real meanings of their family's advice. On the other hand young adults who have immature mentality are easy to be affected by their friends because friends are same situation of them. The influence of the friends who has different way of thinking is large for young people. But the problem is that these ways of thinking or advice of friends is not always right things. In some case the influence of the friends might lead children to wrong way. So to make a good friend is important to grow up their way of thinking. If the young adults means that 15 18 years old child it is important for parents to take care of the relation ship between child and his friends.
