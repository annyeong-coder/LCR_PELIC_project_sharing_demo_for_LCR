In order to fulfill my precious life I will experience my life with wealth and love in the next decade. First of all I will complete my graduated school education in three years then go back to Taiwan and start working with my old companions. Because of the company has already been controlled by the old guys the beginning may be a harsh moment for me. However I believe that is how things get started and I think I can get through it. I will handle all the troubles with my friends and my business abilities but it may takes ten years or more to settle everything down. After my job is becoming stable I will try to make my life more colorful by seeing the other places and interact with other people. I have always been rigid and inflexible I have never built deep relationship with others since I was denied and hurt hardly by others when I was ten. But I believe time will cure everything and someday I will acknowledge what I have done. Then I will share myself with another crucial people in my life and continue this fluctuant life.
