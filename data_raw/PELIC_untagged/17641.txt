The causes of unemployment The economic parameters are common in almost the entire world because the economical system is the same. Basically many countries are related through on international trade such as importation or exportation of Raw Materials. Then when some country has an economical problem affect directly on job's offer lower and less consumption and a lot of other things also we can add too much educational offer. Those are some causes that affect unemployment. The first cause is the less job offer. Under economics' problems many stores and companies doesn't find people who want to work because owner companies don't have adequate earnings therefore they don't take on people or they offer low incomes. Then a lot of people are taking off of their jobs and others don't want taking job under that term. The second cause is less consumption. That is a vicious cycle because a less consumption as a result unemployment and when there are unemployment people don't buy anything because they don't have money. Then the only way to tear down that cycle is giving subsides from the government to companies thus companies must give employment to people. In another hand the educational offer is so much then many people have the same major that reduce the opportunities to find job because places to work are the same. For example in Chile there are a lot of lawyers and business managers and they don't have so much work's opportunities or they have low incomes. In conclusion unemployment causes are a lot but economical system has some unsolved problems and that produce vicious cycles. Thus economical system should be helped by the government of each country also government should be information about how many people are studying the same major. Finally if the previous causes are being solving job's offer will not be lower. Could it be possible
