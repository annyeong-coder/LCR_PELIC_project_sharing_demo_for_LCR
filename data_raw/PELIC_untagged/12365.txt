In 2004 I was studying in New Zealand. It was when I meet my x girlfriend at the University of Akland. I was studying English as a second language and she just finished high school. However we were both 18 years old at the time. I meet her at the public library and we went out for a cup of coffee. And that is one of my relationship that I had in New Zealand.
