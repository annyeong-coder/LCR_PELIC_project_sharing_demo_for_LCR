In my days work I have many things to do . First of all I wake up in 6 am and my class begin in 9 . I have to wake up early ever day because I have to put my son in his daycare . Every mooring I drink coffee and I acquire doing that . Also In every initial mooring the street always crowded and that make me concern . Secondly I start my first class in reading at 9 in mooring and I finish at 3 pm . My target is to improve my English and to study in university . Finally I am exciting to learn more in ELI school.
