About my favorite restaurant. My favorite restaurant is Veracruz this is a restaurant of Mexican food in this restaurant there are many types of cuisine for example enchiladas burritos nachos quesadillas and more. Also they have typical drinks like horchata and Jamaica. And other thing is that I think that this restaurant is very cheap. I'm going at Veracruz almost every weekends I like very much this place.
