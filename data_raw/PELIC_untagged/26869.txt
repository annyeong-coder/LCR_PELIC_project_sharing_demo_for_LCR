From the moment I graduated from college a single idea persisted in my mind. That is where to go from here and what can I do to further expand my chances of success in my career Looking up to my father who is a Ph. D holder it was then the decision came out naturally to resume my graduate study leading to a Master's and Ph. D degrees. After being awarding a full sponsored scholarship the only thing left to do is choose a place where I'm going to pursue my aspirations since the United States have the top universities in the world it was only natural to be my choice. However being born and raised for a short period of time was a significant factor of my decision to come here as well. Being a citizen of the US can facilitate or open several opportunities. Now what is left is to choose a state and a city. Pennsylvania is always known to be one of the oldest and biggest states and it is the state where Pittsburgh is. Pittsburgh the home of the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University which are two icons in my field of study which is computer engineering. And since most of my family still lives in Pittsburgh it was almost natural for me to join them. However before I begin pursing my dreams I needed to make sure I have the right tools to achieve my goals. Improving my English language skills is the most significant one. Choosing the ELI for this purpose came after numerous recommendations for its program by several members in my family. Plus I have been always curious from the moment I came to Pittsburgh about what lies within this fascinating building that is called The Cathedral of Learning . And thus began my journey with the ELI.
