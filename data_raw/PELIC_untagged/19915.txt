Before I came to the U. S. I had done with the first year of my Korean University. When I arrived to Pittsburgh I wanted to live by myself but I haven't lived alone because I have to live with my parents. After I came to U. S. I have learned practical English from my American friends. Before I attended to University of Pittsburgh I have studied English at Duquesne University. After I came to University of Pittsburgh I have had a good time and still I'm having a nice time.
