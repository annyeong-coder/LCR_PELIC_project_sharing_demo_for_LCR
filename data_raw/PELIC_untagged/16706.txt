Studying in PITT and I go to school except Wednesday and weekend. Every day I get up at 8 A. M and go to school by bus. After school I usually study English or watch news. On weekend I usually watch movies or American dramas because I can learn English from those. I hope that I can improve my listening and speeching . Finally I can speak fluently English with native speaker.
