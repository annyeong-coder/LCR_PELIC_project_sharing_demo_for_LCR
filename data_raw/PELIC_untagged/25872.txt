My dream had always been to be an engineer since I was 13 years old. Like every profession engineering needs skills to be the best. Engineering needs unique skills. For instance you have to know how to speak English to use computer and to be creative. Everyone wants to have works unique because those will make him or her the best. Let me explain the three skills individually. To begin with the first necessary skill is the mastery of English. You need this skill to deal with workers and read directions for tools. Also you need English to contact international companies and order parts or tools. However most interesting is the chance to work outside your country thus you have to speak English so that you will be the best candidate for the job. You most expand your possibilities of employment. However computer is as important as the english. Nowadays evrything become using in computer. Computer is important because you have to design the blue print in the computer. Also computer can help you with designing by given you how your design looks in real world but you still have to learn how to use computer and how to use softwears. Nowadays computer is required in your job. Also creativity is important because you need to make your work unique to have a lot of clients. You need to have imagination to creat amazing design. However you need to come with a new ideas all the time. If you have a strong creativity that will make your company to become an international company and everyone will want you to design something for them. In conclusion having these three skills will make you the best. However it will help your company to expand internationally. I recommend to learn the first two skills but creativity come from your mind. Creativity is a natural skill.
