When I moved to Pittsburgh I have done many things. I have almost finish studied English and I have made American friends. These couple points were very significant. Also I have prepared TOFEL test and GMAT. At the same time I have figured out American culture and it was a imortant part to communicate with American people. Finally I have read my favorite book in Pittsburgh.
