I have a friend who loves to play baseball. My friend whose name is Agustin is from Mexico. Sometimes he invited me to play baseball but I don't like it. In Agustin's house that has a very big yard all of my friends went to play baseball or soccer. Now he lives in Toronto and I live in Pittsburgh. Toronto is a city which is in Canada but is very near from Pittsburgh. The next month I'm going to visit him there but first I will go to New York and Washington which are to 5 or 6 hours from Pittsburgh.
