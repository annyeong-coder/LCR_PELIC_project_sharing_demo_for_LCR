I change some of my opinions. But I do not change my opinion about but a new computer on line. I have three reasons of this. First each way to buy a new computer need to use much packing material . Second I do not choose next day delivery. That means I do not need use airplane and I can save much fuel of my car. I do not need to drive car go to computer store. Third in general computer do not have more preblems so I do not need return it. In conclusion if I want to buy a computer I choose on line shopping. Other stuff such as clothes I do not choose on line shopping.
