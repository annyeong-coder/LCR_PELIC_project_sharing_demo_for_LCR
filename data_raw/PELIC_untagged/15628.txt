Many people made lots of wrong decisions while they has been living. So they regretted about their decisions. Well. . So do I! Actually I made a ton of wrong decisions during my lives but I think positively. First I wish I had studied very hard in the high school. If I had studied hard I would have gone the most famous university in Korea. If only I had gone the university what I wanted. If I had gone the university I wouldn't have been here. However I think my decision was correct this time. I'd like to go an university in the U. S. Also I love America! I hope I can achieve my dream.
