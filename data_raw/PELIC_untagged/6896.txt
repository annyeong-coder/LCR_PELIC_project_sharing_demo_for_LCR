Our pet a Japanese dog was one of the important family members. When my daughter was 3 years old we had a small Japanese dog for her because she was our only child and we hoped to educate her to pet him. After he became our family member since he was 3 months old our life was changed well. She and my husband went walking with him every morning and evening. I had to feed him my handmade food because a Japanese dog could live on plain food. He was always playful with us and behaved so funny and lovely and we enjoyed to spend time with him every day. I liked to feed and train him because he was simple and never said things against my will. As he was in his house outside he protected us from strangers by barking. Also I often brought him to the doctor for Filaria or some kind of vaccine and sometimes for his illness. For those reasons he was more submissive to me than others. Finally he finished his life after 17 years in my having him while my daughter was an university student in another city. I was very sad to miss him and I often cried when I thought about him.
