Disposing of garbage is one of the most important issue in Korea. Because Korea has relatively small terriory there is not enough place to deposit all garbage as much as it was discarded. Furthermore eventhough some places are chosen as landfill the resistance of the region would eventually object the plan. Therefore solutions of the problem could be suggested in two ways which are simple. First one is reducing the amount of garbage. For this gorvenment establish the policy to make people divide recycles or not and if they discard unrecycling garbage they have to put it in specific plastic bag which they have to buy. If they don't follow dividing garbage rule the gorvenment give them fine. Second solution is recycling garbage. The divided and collected garbage is recycled according to its use and property.
