Three years ago when I was 17 years old an Egyptian family lived next to our home. They had two kids boy was named ANON_NAME_0 and girl was named Fatima. Once the kids were playing outside their house without their parents' knowledge. I was having coffee with my brothers in the back yard when we heard Fatima screaming. We all rushed outside to see what happened. ANON_NAME_0 was bitted by a mad dog came from the mountain near to us. Then ANON_NAME_0 immediately was taken to the hospital by ANON_NAME_1 my older brother. And the dog was being taken away when I was trying to comfort Fatima by my other brothers. Finally ANON_NAME_0 was given the blood that he was needed by ANON_NAME_1. When we got home we told the kids that they shouldn't have been playing outside with out their parents' permission.
