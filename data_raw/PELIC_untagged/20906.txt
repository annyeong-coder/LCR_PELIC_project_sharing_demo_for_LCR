There many programs I like to watch and many programs I don't like to watch. First I like to watch the news. For example I like to watch weather news because I would like to know how the weather will be on the next day. For instance if it is rainy or not or if I need an embrella or not. In addition I like to watch local news because I need to know what happens in my city. However I don't like to watch political news because I hate the political. Second I like to watch comedy programs. For example Satureday night because some times I need to go a way frome scope of study. Furthermore I like to watch to American shows such as lost and brothers and sisters. I prefer to watch American shows because they help me to improve my listening and let me know American culture. Moreover I like to watch sports programs such as American football and soccer game but I don't prefer to watch basketball or tennis game. Also I don't like to watch cooking programs. In conclusion Tv programs are important to me because the programs that which I watch they learn me new things every day.
