I had never played tennis before I began living here. I have been poor at sports since I was a child. I didn't like sports and I always tried to avoid sports. However I enjoy playing tennis now. The reason I began playing tennis is my apartment has a tennis court and the residents can use it for free. Because my husband invited me to play tennis with him I unwillingly began playing tennis. Recently I have started to like tennis gradually. I have realized that I can enjoy sports even if I cannot play well.
