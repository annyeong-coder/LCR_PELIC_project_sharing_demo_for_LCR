This fall 152 students from more than 14 countries enrolled in the ELI at Pitt. They brought different lifestyles cultures and religions. ANON_NAME_0 one of the ELI students said In the future maybe I can visit my classmates in their home country. And then they can understand my culture and I can understand their culture and religion. In addition the ELI at Pitt provides more and more activities. There were 14 activities last fall and 24 activities have already been planned this fall. Students can have the chance to meet more people in other classes in the ELI. I can make new friends with more students ANON_NAME_1 one of the ELI students said. It is more important that in the ELI you can choose how many courses you want to take by yourself. It is flexible. Junhee Park said I have a F1 visa. I must take full time classes. Because there are good courses and good teachers I don't want to lose this opportunity ANON_NAME_2 a full time student said. Because of the above reasons the ELI at Pitt is a good choice for students who want to study English.
