When I first visited my father's factories in Vietnam and China during the summer vacation in 2007 I found that there is no a well organized computer system to deal with all of the order forms stocks and delivery forms. Since that I have a dream. I want to build up a better and personalized computer system for my father's companies and use e business to sell his products on line. To make my dream come true I need to learn deeply and completely in my field Information Technology. Having a chance to meet my mentor in college he encouraged me to pursue my advanced study abroad. After careful consideration I decided to complete my master degree in the United States. Because my father's company needs someone to communicate with foreigners speaking English is also an important requirement. And the courses in your school can make me to achieve my goal therefore studying in your school will prepare me to be a good employee in my father's company. After attending the information session and talking with Dr. Zhong I figured out that only University of Massachusetts Boston will prepare me to achieve my career goal.
