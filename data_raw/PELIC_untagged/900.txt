Friendship is an action rather than words. A friend may be of any age gender nationality or religion. He is someone who shared with you common experiences. He is someone who helps you in times of need. He is someone in who you can confide and save your secrets. He is not whom hanging out with you most of the time a friend is whom honest with you most of the time. He is someone who would do anything for a friend. In my country I have many friends who know me and I know them but when I look at my friends I will find only 30 of them who are often acted like a friend. I usually prefer to hang out with a friend whose interests like mine. I have two strong friends whose our childhood begun together and both of them are cozens. We start our study when we were at school which was near from our house.
