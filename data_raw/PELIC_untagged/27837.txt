The novel talks about a girl lives with her relatives after their parents pased away. Her name is Jane Eyre. She suffers a lot from her uncle's wife who treats her badly and has a bias aginst her. She is a kid and wants to play with her relatives uncles'daughters. She is not eatting with them and her uncle's mother imposes that Jane eats alone. Her uncle is the only one who loves her a little bit. However she is punished many times and once she is stuck at a dark room for the whole night alone. Many misrable things happen for this poor orphan girl. Uncles's wife is the negative and bad character in the novel titled Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronttee. The nvoel is tragic and it sounds to me that more bad things will happen to Jane. The novel is not finished yet and I have read just a few chapters.
