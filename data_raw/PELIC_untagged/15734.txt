Last summer one Wednesday my phone rang when I was watching TV. I picked up the phone. It was form Liang who is my best friend. He invited me to picnic next Sunday. I was very happy. After I hung up the phone I thought over the details of picnic such as food charcoal and drink. The next day I called him back. We talked over the details of the picnic on the phone. Finally we determined the exact time and location and everything we need. Saturday night I set up my alarm clock. On Sunday I woke up very early. I picked out my favor coat and put it on. Everything was ready to go. Suddenly the storm came. A few minutes later Liang called me again. He canceled the plan and would like to do it over next week. The bad weather brought me down. My wife knew I was not happy and she talked me about my favorite movie and made some fun. I knew she wanted to cheer me up. I appreciate what she did. The next Sunday we had a wonderful picnic and made a lot of fun.
