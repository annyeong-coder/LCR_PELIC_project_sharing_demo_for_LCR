The personality category that fits me most closely is extrovert. Extroverts are people whose energies are activated by being with others. For example I got motivation from my husband who is tring to achieve his objective. Also I will be happy when I talk to someone who has different experiences. The personality category that fits me most closely is feeler. Feelers are people who make decisions based on their personal values and how they feel about choices. I think what I shoud do before I try to do something without regrets. For instance if I need to make money I don't apply for a loan because it gives me stress. I have to return money which I borrow at the bank. So if I buy something I will work or earn money. The personality category that fits me most closely is judger. Judgers are people who prefer a predictable environment. For example I want to decide time or place I meet with my friends because if we didn't decide it clealy I might wait for a while. It's wast of time. So I confirm anything which I need.
