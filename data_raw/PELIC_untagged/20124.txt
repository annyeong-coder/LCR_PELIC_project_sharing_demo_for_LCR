If I bring a couple of air purifying plants into classroom I will feel better. I would like to change the position of posters on the chalkboard by taking down into shoulder level high. If I am not satisfied with new change I will do it over until classroom is perfectly set up. I will also pick up some chairs which might require repairs and get it fixed. Then classroom will show off its good shape finally.
