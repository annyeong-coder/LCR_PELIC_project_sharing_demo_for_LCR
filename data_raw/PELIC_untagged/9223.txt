I lost on friday my leather gloves on the bus which I bought the day before. I should have paid attention about my gloves. Therefore I left it on the bus. It was my first time I wore my gloves in this year and was not accustomed to have something by me. I ought to have put it on me but I let it on my knees while I went downtown. It might fallen down when I stood up. After I got off the bus and got on a my second bus to school I could remember that I hadn't my gloves at me. At that moment I thought that I shouldn't have forgot my gloves and that I was so stupid. I shouldn't have took the next bus but I realized it after the bus drove me to the next stop. I got off the bus and ran through downtown while hoping to catch the bus. However I didn't know the route of the bus. I could have studied the route of my bus while I was here but I didn't. Now I am thinking that I might not have the gloves with me at that unlucky day. I might have let it at home.
