ones especially when they go outside of homes. Furthermore people feel happiness satisfied and greeting while they talk for very important needs. Moreover it is excited to receive calls from family children and any important persons. The last factor that is people affected through social effect. Overall the affect a cell phone can have on a person's well being due to the increasing activity in brain cells. But sometime the affects can be a negative or positive result. I think cell phones can factor on relationships between families or either couples. For example men have a positive experience when they talk to their wives or girlfriends. All in all cell phones designed for all people to serve their needs. I believe that can effect on their life in three aspects which are psychological effect emotional effect and social effect. So I recommend people to curb their enthusiasms with using cell phones. So they have to know the influences of using the cell phones.
