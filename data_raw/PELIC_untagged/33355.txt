When I was 15 I had been to Perth Australia by myself. I had never traveled alone before this experience. I had taken the plane for 10 hours and I had been watching movies without no rest on the flight. When I arrived I had already been awake for 20 hours. But I didn't feel tired because of excitation. I had known many friends from different countries and we had been hanging out everyday. This experience expanded my horizons and I found my interest in making friends with people from different countries.
