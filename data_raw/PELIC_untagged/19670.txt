Most people think of the mentally disordered as a delusional lot holding bizarre and irrational ideas about themselves and the world around them but recently there are some research challenging this common sense notion. In 1988 psychologists Shelly Taylor and Jonathon Brown published an article making the somewhat disturbing claim that positive self deception is a normal and beneficial part of most people's everyday outlook. They said that average people hold cognitive biases in three factors. First viewing themselves in unrealistically positive terms. Second believing they have more control over their environment than they actually do. Third holding views about the future that are more positive than the evidence can justify. However there are some research or theory that oppose those three factors such as A 2006 study at the University of Maastricht in the Netherlands about consider eating disorders concept depressive realism etc. . It's a disconcerting concept. It's certainly easier to think of the mentally disordered as lunatics running about with bizarre inexplicable beliefs than to imagine them coping with a piece of reality that a normal person can't handle.
