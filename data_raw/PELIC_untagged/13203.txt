English will remain one of the world's most important languages in the future but it will be no longer the dominant language in the world. The number of speakers for whom English is a native language is decreasing and according to the deta the number of native English speaker will be smaller than Chinese Hindu Urdu and Arabic speakers among 15 to 24 years olds by 2050. On the other hand the number of native Chinese speakers is rapidly increasing and more and more people are learning Chinese as a second language. However the global share of English as a second language is still much larger and the number of second language speakers of English will continue to rise as well as Chinese speakers consequently English will not be the dominant language any more but remain one of the most important languages in the world.
