There are many thing I'm going to do them in the future and I hope I can do all of them. First I'm going to study in the ELI then I will start the academic in Pittsburgh University if I could. Second I might work in any bank in my country if I have the chance because banks will give me a lot of money. Finally I'm going to buy a car soon if I could and I might buy my friend's car.
