I have learned to drive since I came to America. I have moved three times since I came to Houston. I used to be a working mam but now I am a housewife. I thought that American like to move according to a research American move approximately every five years. But now I think maybe they need to move. I have driven a car and visited New York and Boston. I visited Washington DC and Philadelphia last year summer. I have remarkable impression on the spectacular Niaqara Falls. I have known how to make a Sandwish. I have met people from all over the world. I enjoy living in Pittsburgh. I like studying in ELI.
