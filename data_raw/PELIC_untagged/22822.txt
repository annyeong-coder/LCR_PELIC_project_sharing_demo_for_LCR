My room in the United States is a big room because it has two bed rooms one living room and one kitchen room. So I feel comfortable when I stay in my room and I like to switch light on and turned heater on because I don't like the cold weather and absolutely I must use the humidifier so I must fill the water up. Two day ago when I watched TV I think why I don't clean up my bedroom because my bedroom had a lot of newspapers on the desk and a lot of paper flakes on the floor and more dirty clothes so I closed down TV and turned on the radio and turned volume up and I began keep on cleaning my bedroom. First I took the newspapers away the desk. Next I threw paper flakes out of the floor and I took my dirty clothes off my room and cleaned up them and I wanted to do my desk up. So I put on the vase and the flowers on the desk. Finally I took curtains down because I want more natural lights in my room.
