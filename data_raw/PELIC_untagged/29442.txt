Moving into Pittsburgh from Blacksburg my husband and I had been struggling to sustain oursevles for days without electricity. It was in the middle of summer so we could not even stay at home beause it was too hot. Wandering around the neighborhood we had to have every meal outside but our choce was limited because we were unfamiliar with geography in Pittsburgh. Getting sick of food in restaurants we met a Korean couple who had moved into the same apartment a couple of weeks earlier than us in church and after hearing the situation that we got stuck in they invited us to their place for dinner. And it was just great! The meal that we were served there was just a common Korean style one with a rice a bowl of soup and a few side dishes including Kimchi but it still has been remained as one of the best meals I have ever had.
