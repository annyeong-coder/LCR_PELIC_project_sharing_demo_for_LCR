In Christmas I'm going to Hong ANON_NAME_0 and take the Test Of English as Foreign Language TOEFL . I might receive many Christmas presents. After Christmas I will fly back to Pittsburgh and continue to study English in the English Language Institute ELI at the University of Pittsburgh. I may apply to the University of Pittsburgh before March. I might choose business or nutrition for my major. I will get a driver's license in the next year. I may stay in Pittsburgh for two to four years. I will get a job when I graduate. If I don't enter University or graduate then I will go back to Hong ANON_NAME_0 and compete in the Miss Hong ANON_NAME_0 Pageant. I might get married before I turn 25. After that I will have two babies and hopefully they will be twins.
