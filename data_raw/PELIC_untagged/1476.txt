I don't think men and women should live in a separate world. His arguments are if they life in a separate world they would happen some problem. Men will fight and women will be helpless. If this really happened they will help each others and they will not be any problem. However being separate is not the solutions for the world. If there are 2 worlds they will not stop the generation. So they will destroy themselves.
