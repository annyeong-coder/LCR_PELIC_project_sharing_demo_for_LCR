My sister is a beautiful girl. There is always smile on her face. You can see her brilliant teeth when she puts on her smile. Also she has nice hazel eyes. Then she's medium weight and average height. She doesn't wear glasses but she uses contact lenses. You can realize very easily. She has dimple on her cheek. Her hair is brunette and wavy. She usually ties her hair up. She really cares about her appearance. My sister isn't a very beautiful women only she is also humble for insist most of her friend don't know that she has best grades in her classes and she is patient. She isn't a high tempered. Then she is a very courage. She came the U. S by herself. She is an one person who I spent many times together in the world.
