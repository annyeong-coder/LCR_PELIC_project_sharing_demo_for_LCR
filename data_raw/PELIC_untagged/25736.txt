I enjoy trying unusual dishes. The reason why is that it is kind of opportunity to experience new one and it makes me excited. In addition I can notice why this kind of foods are made. I tried to have Thai food when I was in Chicago. It was really pungent for me for the first time but I could adapt as time went by. Also I could learn or understand their food culture.
