This picture depicts two groups of players when they spated with each other in a baseball game. In my point of view because both groups of players were eager the spat was occured. But even though they were very enthusiastic during the game they had to repect the game rules and respect each other. Moreover I believe the violence in sports will become prevalent unless they put strict rules for whom violate and break down these rules.
