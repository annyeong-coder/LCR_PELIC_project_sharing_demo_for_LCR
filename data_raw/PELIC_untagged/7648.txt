The relationship between man and woman is the most marvelous thing in the world. Last Jane I attended to my elementary music school alumni association ceremony while I was still living in my hometown. In this beautiful party I met my boyfriend Paul was one of my classmates again while I was working so hard and so painful everyday. He came to the United States after he graduated from the school and never went back to his country. We never met each other after we left the school almost 15 years. When I saw him I thought he was a handsome man now not that one of a little silly boy in my memory anymore. And the weirdest thing happened we talked and laugh like old friends like we have known each other for our entire life. After the party we still contacted everyday until he came back the United States in last July. The distance between Taiwan and the United States is so long and we couldn't handle the lovesickness anymore. Consequently that is why I have already been here about 1 year.
