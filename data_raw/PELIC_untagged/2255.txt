I met my girlfriend while my friend who is chinese was visiting Korea. Actually the chinese friend and I weren't friends before he visited Korea. He was my close friend's friend and my friend asked me to take care of the chinese friend while he was visiting Korea. When I met the chinese friend he asked me that he wanted to meet some Korean friends. Therefore I tried him to meet his friends. She was one of them. When I met my girlfriend first I felt good feeling to her. Also she felt same feeling with me. At that time we were visiting the Sang am world cup stadium with him and we had a good time there. After the chinese friend left Korea we became a couple.
