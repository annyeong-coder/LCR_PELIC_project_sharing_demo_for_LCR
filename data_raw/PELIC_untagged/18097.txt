Before I came to the USA my friend had given me a good picture about the americans. Although I am a medical doctor I am eating a lot of sweets. Once I finshed my undergraduate studies I have been awarded a schoreship by my goverment. If I did not got a schoership I would not be here studying advanced english. Despite the fact that excersice is very important to keep our body healthy many people do not regularly practice it. After I will have finshed this semester I will visit my friends in chicago. I hate pets because they carry lots of germs in their skin. Since most of americans are polite I love the US people. When I saw the ELI I thought it is a new bulding. Unless I pay the land lord every month he will not allow me stay in his apartment. While I am studying english in the ELI I am discover new treasur sites for tourism in Pittsburgh.
