As myths exist in different cultures Saudi Arabia has its own myths too. Saudi Arabia is located in the south west of Asia. My favorite myth is a story about any black cat which is narrated to children. It is considered one of the most famous myths in the east coast area of Saudi Arabia. It is said that any black cat may cause harm to children. It is claimed that black cats are the underlying cause of any disease that affects children's health. Even nowadays it is thought that seeing a black cat brings the bad luck to children and pregnant women. This story has been believed to true for many years. Also it is assumed to be created by old grandmothers to their grand springs to let them feel afraid about going out alone.
