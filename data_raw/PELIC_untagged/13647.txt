I was in New York State when I thought to move to Pennsylvania State. I was puzzled to make decision transferring. That was between two institutes ELS ''Point Park University'' and ELI ''Pittsbourgh University''. Although I got some information from my friends who had studied in both Institutes my decision was difficult. After I analyzed the similarities and difference between the two institutes I saw the ELI is the best choice. There are many things in common in both institutes. First the students were from all over the world in both institutes. That helps me to learn a lot of information from their cultures. Second. In both institutes there are many interesting activities. Finally both institutes are located in a convenient place in Pittsburgh City. In fact when I looked at the similarity it seems to me is not important factors in my decision. First of all the most important thing for me was the quality of education. ELS has not as good quality education as the ELI. The study program was monthly courses. On the other hand the ELI has a semester course and I like it. In addition I can continue and complete my major academic study in Pittsburgh University. Although I'm sponsoring student but I would like to know how much the cost that my country has to pay. I found the ELS more expensive than ELI compared to duration of study. Finally ELS has limited advantage. In contrast ELI has capability to do many advantages for us as a new international student. Such as public transportation print and copy serves and large library all of these are free. In conclusion my decision was easier after taking everything in to consideration. High quality of education a lot of advantage and suitable cost are all very important to me. Therefore I decided to make registration in ELI.
