Kuala Lumpur. It has some of the most wonderful buildings in the world I was visiting it at 2004 . It also has some of the best resturant in Malaysia. It has two the longest Towers in the world. From there you get the best view of the city. It has the biggest airport in the Eastern Asia. I was interesting when I visited it. I think it has the best hotels in the world. I think it is cheaper than many cities that I visited before and it is biger than many cities that I visited before like Bangkok or Jakarta. So I was amazing when I visited Kuala Lumpur.
