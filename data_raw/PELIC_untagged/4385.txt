It was my first time to see a family doctor who can check people's health easily in the U. S. I think a family doctor is very good. There are two reasons. First of all they can check our health first. It means people who get sick don't have to go to a big hospital directly. Before they go to the big hospital they can go to see a family doctor. The doctor will check their health and if it's not so serious then people will get a prescription and they don't have to spend much money in another hospital. Secondly a family doctor can counsel people and give some advices. For example someone always feels tired so he can't work. When he goes to see a family doctor the doctor will listen to him while the doctor checks his body and health condition. After the doctor decides that it's not necessary to go to another big hospital the doctor will give some advices or solutions to the patient. Even though the advices are simple such as changing routine or doing exercise they must be helpful to the patient. These days people spend almost of their time on working their job. As a result people might get sick easily. They need to talk to someone who can give them advices before they get worse. Therefore I think a family doctor is an important job to keep many people's health.
