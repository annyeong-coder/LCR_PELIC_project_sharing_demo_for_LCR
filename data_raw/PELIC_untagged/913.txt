Limiting students' time on line is a helpful way to manage people who have a Webholism problem. Some people spend a lot of their time on the Internet and they may forget every thing by this way. When someone feel he has unlimited time in the Internet he is going to be free to use the Internet. Moreover he might spend all of his day at the computer. Limiting the time may help them to decrease this problem a little bit. Some people have their won computer in their home and they can use the Internet whenever they want. In this case it might not work to limit the time of using the Internet. On the other hand some people are in need to use the Internet. Fore instance if some is studying how he can design websites or something like this. It is going to be hard for him to limit his time. This is because this is what he studies and he should apply or train himself in his field. In my opinion if a school wants to limit the time of using the Internet it should care about the major that everyone is studying. Webholism is a sick when someone get it is had to not do it. It is a main cause of having peblems with everyone's eyes. Maybe people can't notice this during the daily life but they are going to notice this after a while or when the get old. A lot of people try to advice people who are webholism but they don't go for them by a good side. It is not good to say to someone directly don't use the Internet . Some people have wonderful ways to advise such as when they don't want you use the computer they tell you that let's to some place and they notice that he should like that place. And then they try to interest him as much as they can. After that he is going to wait for another opportunity to go with these people. In conclusion it is some time an advantage to limit students' time but it is not if someone is in need of all the time.
