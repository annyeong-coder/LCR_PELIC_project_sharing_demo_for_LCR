Luke Skywalker has special characteristics in this movie which is star wars. Firstly he was not born with a difficult birth like Jesus. In addition he did not have a patrimony from anyone but he was fostered by Obi Wan Kenobi. This man who tried to teach him how to fight with the rebellion to get princes ANON_NAME_0 back to her land actually Skywalker liked to quest an example when he requested from Obi Wan Kenoby to go with him in order to fight the rebellion. Obviously he had side kicked. I considered that Han solo was one of his cooperator but he was not really want to help in order to get the princes ANON_NAME_0 back but because he wanted to get the essential thing which was money. Eventually he made the true path which was getting Princes ANON_NAME_0 back to her land.
