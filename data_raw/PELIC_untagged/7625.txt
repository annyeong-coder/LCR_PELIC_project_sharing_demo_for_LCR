All weekends very special for me. Each week I plan to what I am going to do on weekend. On the weekend I like to watch movies which is a famous movies. Sometimes I rent dvd vcd or video casette from library. Watching movie encouraged me to go to the library when I go to the library I don't just rent dvd . Sometimes I read book or research something about Pittsburgh . In addition on the weekend although I like to play tennis I can't play . Furthermore I like to go to shopping with my sister . Also the weekend help me to revive myself.
