Hi I'm jichul. I was born in mokpo Korea and I've lived in incheol Korea. I've been a office worker. But I'm a ELI student. I liked playing soccer and watching movies. Of course I've been playing soccer and watching movies until now. First when I was an elementary child I entered soccer club. I've learned how to play soccer. Since I moved to Pittsburgh I've been playing soccer in park and maintaining my health at every Sunday morning. Second I'm always watching movies in my spare time. My favorite kind of movie is an action movie. If I were in no mood for doing anything Action movies would make me change in a good mood.
