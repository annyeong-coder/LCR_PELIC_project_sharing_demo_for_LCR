On middle of May 2008 I was worried about whether I quit my job. On end of July I quit my job but shouldn't I have quit it Somebody said You had better support your family. On the other hand somebody said You should do something new for your future. And my wife said You may do as you think. If I kept working I might have regretted. Now I'm satisfied with studying English in ELI. I think that I could have come here earlier.
