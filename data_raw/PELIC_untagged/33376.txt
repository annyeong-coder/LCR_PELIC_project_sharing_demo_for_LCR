I don't like to live in the leisureville because I thought it was not a real life. In addition most of people are senior citizens in the lisureville we couldn't find special ideas or special activities. As a result people who live in the leisureville have a negative effect on my behavior and I will get older quickly. I would like to live in my house and do something I like to enjoy my retirement life. Although according to article it is happy and carefree to live in the leisureville but it is also isolation. I thought one way to keep young mind is to live in real society and try to learn new things such as using the tablet shipping on line.
