Money is crucial to our daily lives because we have to use it everyday. In Taiwan I usually brought a lot of money when I went outside because I dislike using credit card. The experience happened two years ago when I was buying breakfast at the breakfast restaurant. At that time I was dizzy because I had gotten drunk in the birthday party last night and I went to work in a hurry. I discovered that I forgot bringing money when the meal was ready for me. In addition I was embarrassed and nervous when the manager was asking for money. Fortunately I met my friend and I borrowed some money from him to solve the problem.
