Richard Curtis is one of my favorite directors. He has directed many big movies including Love Actually Mr. Bean's Holiday and Bridget Jones The Edge Of Reason. Especially I love to wacth Love Actually and Bridget Jones The Edge Of Reason most of which are so cool. Love Actually released in 2003 was made in England. Hugh Grant my favorite actor starred in Love Actually. I watch it every Christmas. Bridget Jones The Edge Of Reasond released in 2004 is also one of my favorites. Bridget Jones The Edge Of Reason starring Hugh Grant Renee Zellweger and Colin Firth was big issue in Korea. I like the actors most of whom are big movie stars. I love these movies both of which are so impressive.
