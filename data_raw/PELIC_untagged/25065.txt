I met with my husband at medical faculty. He was a very succesfull student. During medical faculty we were a very good friend. When we graduated from medical faculty we got married. We have two children. While we were working same hospital we took specilaist examinations. While we were planning to come the US we won green card and then we came to the US one year ago.
