My future plans are not yet completely definite. In January I'm going to start a new semester at the ELI. I might take the summer semester too. Then my future plans will depend on my husband's studies. He will complete his master's degree next year. He might be admitted in a university in Southern California New York or Pennsylvania for PhD. In that case we will stay in the USA for three more years. He also might be admitted in a university in Scotland or England. In that case we will move to Europe. At any rate I'll paint and draw for sure. I might start to work if we move out but I couldn't do it if we stayed here. Anyway I have a lot of plans in order not to be bored. I could continue my salsa lessons because I like this dance so much I used to dance in Russia. I also have a dream to play a music instrument I may start lessons next year. Then I intend to learn Spanish. It's sure that I'll do it but I don't know when. I could start it when I finish ELI. I have to learn many languages because my husband may get a job in any foreign country. However he might work in Russia too. If this occurs I would be happy.
