One thing that I've been successful is playing ping pong. I have some reasons to explain why I'm a good player. First when I was teenager I began to practice this play at home because my oldest brother bought a table of ping pong for us during our school vacation. Second I could practice a lot for many hours every day. Today I can play very well with someone even when I haven't played for a long time. The last thing why I became a good player was because my brother was very good player so I needed to be better than him to win the game. Because the game is quick you need to pay attention all time.
