Dear Confused You seem to spend hard time nowadays. First you should talk with your parents. For instance National is different but American is also the same person. Although Jim has living in American culture Jim always understands the Japanese culture and my mind. You have to talk them into Jim. Second step show them up how you love him. Also Jim shows too. They worry about your happiness so you show them how much you and Jim are happy. Last you have to teach Jim Japanese. It can help they feel close to Jim. If your parents talk with Jim in Japanese they may like Jim. Don't give up and cheer up! Confused.
