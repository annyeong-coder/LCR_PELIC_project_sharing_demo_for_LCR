Look before you leap. When I was in high school I was a good student but I always answered a question before I was thinking. I answered very fast correctly so I never had trouble. Then I took a class from Mr. ANON_NAME_0 the toughest teacher in the school. He rebuked me when I answered the question quickly even if the answer was correct. In the class I answered the question incorrectly even I answered the same question wrong in the test. After that I became thinking about before I answered any question.
