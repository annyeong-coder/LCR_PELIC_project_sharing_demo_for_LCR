The most interesting experience I have ever had with money was two years ago when I was visiting France. I went to the restaurant at the hotel. I ordered a meal with out looking at the price. I was visiting this restaurant at the first time and I didn't know it was too much expensive. There was too many people in this restaurant. In fact It was too much to me to afford. When I received my bill the total was 35 uro without tip. Unfortunately in my wallet there was less than this amount. Also I forgot my credit card at home. In this case my friend paid for me the rest of money and I was so impressed.
