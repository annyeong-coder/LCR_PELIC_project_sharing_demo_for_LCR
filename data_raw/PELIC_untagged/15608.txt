I'd like to talk about the movie 'Zeitgeist' uncovering secrets about some events in history. This movie largely talks about three topics which includes9. 11 And Iraq war and monetary system of the US. It provides so astounding argumentatios. For example peopel are having false belief about 9. 11 The political accident totally manipulated by U. S government not by terrorist. Sometimes it sounds like a conspiracy. Furthermore the evidences they insist on have not turned out the truths yet. However I'm still curious why the US have not provided reasonable refutations against those arguments in the movie. In regardless of whether it is true or not the movie is worth seeing since they give a totally another view.
