My favorite vacation in April I go to natural please were are trees and grass lands there is clear air. I smell good air. And I see natural pleases. I don't listen any noise. In the night I look to sky to the stars and the moon . Some times I see some animals like rabbits or foxes. In the morning I look to sun when it rising. So I think the cooking in natural pleases more delicious than the houses. I spend good times and I don't for get this moments
