Obesity In the U. S. Around 20 of the population is obese and 4 is superobese. Many of these people seem to not understand the problem that is being obese means and all the risk and diseases the obesity brings. I dislike realizing that obesity is becoming an epidemic disease in the world. Many cultures apreciate being overweith and fat as a substitute for good health because of this eating patterns parents enjoy serving big portions. Parents encourage children to eat fast food because they can't afford to cook homemade meals. Often fast food is less expensive because of this fast food is many times the first option to buy. It is now common for children to go frequently to the hospital with complains that used to be mainly in the adults like hipertension and diabetes mellitus. We need campains to explain to people the risk and concequences and a new life style.
