For me it's a good idea to have such a chance to join Second Life and it can gives me benefits in many aspect. For learning and practicing aspects it is a big opportunity to try speaking or even communicate with others in the digital world. For instance making a relationships between virtual friends can improve my ability to talk with others. In the personal aspect it's a good way to express your feeling and discover the experience that you couldn't try it in the real life. For example in my real world I didn't learn how to drive a car so I can drive in the real life yet but in the Second Life I can.
