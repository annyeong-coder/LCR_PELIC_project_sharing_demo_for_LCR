I used to live in Korea and I attended Yong In University. In those days I used to play judo with my classmate and we used to point out mistakes each other. After we finished exercise we used to have Korean food for a meal. We would not be used to eating American food at all because American food did not make us full. I am currently living in Pittsburgh and I am attending University of Pittsburgh. There are two problems. First I do not play judo anymore because I do not have a judo uniform and friends who used to play with me. Second I am not used to eating American food even though I am living here. In conclusion I am always trying to put myself into American life as fast as I can. If I put myself into American life enough I will start exercising again and I would be used to enjoying American food.
