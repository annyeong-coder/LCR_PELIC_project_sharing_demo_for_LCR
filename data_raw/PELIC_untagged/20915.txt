Things that I had never done before I came to Pittsburgh. Before I came to Pittsburgh I had never seen the snow but I remember that in my first week here last spring I saw snow and it was very pretty. In Colombia we do not have seasons so the weather is always the same! Consequently before I came to Pittsburgh I had never bought winter clothes! I bought jackets gloves scarves and hats. My husband told me that I will look like an Eskimo but I do not care because I feel afraid about the cold and I do not want to be sick for New Year because we are going to Colombia for this holiday. In addition I have never ice skated and lots of movies show Rockefeller Center in NYC with a lot of children and people ice skating I think it is beautiful and romantic so I can't wait to ice skate this winter. My husband and I have not done winter sports and we are very excited about this winter because we want to learn! We are planning to go to a resort to learn how to ski we think we need to have this experience because it is something different for us. Obviously we are not the best at practicing extreme sports but we think this is one opportunity to learn something new and interesting. I had never had made friends from different countries around the world and this is also something that I had never done before I came to Pittsburgh now I have friends from China South Korea Lebanon Spain Peru Chile and Venezuela. I have learned many things from all of them and I hope we can be friends for many years. In addition when I arrived to Pittsburgh my first days I felt afraid because when I went to the States I always was with my parents and my sister we are a very close family. When I arrived here It was a new world for me with a different culture and life style so everything has changed for me. For example I had never cooked and my husband and I have had funny situations in the kitchen. I think in Pittsburgh I have learned many things and I have met very wonderful people.
