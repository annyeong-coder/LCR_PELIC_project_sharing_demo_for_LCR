My Best Trip That I Have Taken Last year I went to Egypt with my friends ANON_NAME_0 and ANON_NAME_1 by my car. We stayed twenty days there. Then we continue our trip to Syria we visited many cities there. We spent fifteen days more. We took a lot of picture. ANON_NAME_0's brother live there so we stayed with him just three days. It was very nice trip for me. When we came back to our home country I got a scholarship from my government to complete my study in the USA.
