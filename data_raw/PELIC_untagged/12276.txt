This is also one of the dilemmas because it is true that children must learn discipline and they must have some sense of time restriction. This relates to doing their homework instead of playing with their friends or watching videos until late evening. However children must take their time when they are working on something they really love or they really are interested in. Restricting their time does kill creativity and they might stop liking what once used to be their favorite activity.
