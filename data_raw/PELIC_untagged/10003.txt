I had a wonderful trip with my family in last year. The trip had four people and a dog in California. First day we flew to Las Vegas from Pittsburgh. We stayed in Las Vegas for two days. Las Vegas has a beautiful street and many shows for visitors. There are many famous city buildings in the stress such as New York Egypt and France. We spent much time to see them. We also took some pretty pictures and ate much delicious food in Las Vegas. Then we went to Grand Canyon National Park next day. That is amazing place. There have a powerful and inspiring landscape. Most of visitors wore heavy coat because the weather is cold. I didn't prepare enough clothes for my kids. I bought a few clothes for them. I also spent too much money for the clothes. San Diego was the second place that we visit. I love here because it is a beautiful city. We went to a beach to watch seals. Many seals swam in the sea. Some of the seals lay on the beach. We can't feed any food to them. We should keep some distance form the seals to avoid bothering them. In addition there are a lot of stores for shopping. But you need to prepare enough money for shopping. The end of trip is the Walt Disney Land. This is our favorable place. We saw many parks in the Walt Disney Land. We stayed there for 12 hours because there is big play ground. We didn't have enough time to get to all of the activities. We also spent a little time for getting our lunch and dinner. This is a wonderful experience for my family.
