One of the most enjoyable time I had ever was my first week in Pittsburgh. It was fully of unforgettable memories. In the beginning of the week I had a wonderful time enjoying the delicious food at station square. Also I skied with my friends at market square in downtown. Moreover I had the chance to see the fireworks in the New Year evening. However I was not accustomed with the severe weather. Finally I had a lot of fun in my first week in Pittsburgh. It is really a winsome city to visit.
