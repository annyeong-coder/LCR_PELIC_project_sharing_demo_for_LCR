I believe that is necessary for the children to be creative in the school because it's the one significant place they usually spent their time. In fact for being creative they need many factors to help them with such as a secure environment censorship and competition activity with random chooses. From my perspective these factors are support them from different ways. First they will trust them self as much as that will generate their responsibility. Second these factors are encourage them to participate in varies activity. However the children are the next generation of the country if they got useful education the country will relay on them and they will support their country . On the other hand if the children didn't get attention and enough education their country will costs more and more year by year .
