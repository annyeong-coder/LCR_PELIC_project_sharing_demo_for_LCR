Every writer wants to write how to succeed in writing. But today I want to write how to fail a test. If you want to fail a test do not answer the questions when you take a test. Or don't submit your answer sheet. Then you will have grade 'F'. Answer the wrong answer. However don't write down something related the answer. The teacher might think that you might know some of the text. Then you will never fail the test. Do you think grade 'c' or 'd' are good to get And you can be absent from the test date. If you want to play late outside the day before the test just do whatever you want. This might cause your teacher think you are a bad student. Please follow my instructions then you will fail the test. You nevertheless want to be a success in test do it on the contrary which I've wrote.
