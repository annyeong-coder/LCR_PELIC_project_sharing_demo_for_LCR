Hi everybody. I'm writing this note to introduce myself to you my classmates in English 047. Our teacher is wants a profile from each of us. At first I was confused by this assignment because my English dictionary is definite profile as a side view of someone's head. I thought Why does she want that She sees my head everyday! Then I saw the next definition a short description of a person's life and character. OK then. He is my profile My name is Student's Name . Some of my friends are call me Pay Ha because that is how my initials sound in German. I am studying English here in Miami because I want to attend graduate school in Colorado or Montreal. Maybe are you asking yourself Why he wants to leave Miami to go to these place The answer is snow! I am come from Austria so I love to ski. In fact my nickname in my family is Blitz
