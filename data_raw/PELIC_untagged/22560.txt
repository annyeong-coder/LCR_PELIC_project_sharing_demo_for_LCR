I like many films including Brave heart The Patriot and A Beautiful Mind. Brave heart and The Patriot both of which star Mel Gibson are historical films. A Beautiful mind featuring Russell Crowe was the most impressive film I have recently seen. The film is about a mathematician who I had been already familiar with by the time the film released. I liked the film which described the life of John Nash since it was very interesting and meanwhile very educative for me. My father with whom I saw the movie told me that the real life of John Nash was a little different from the life described in the movie but I still think that A Beautiful Mind is one of the best movies I have ever seen.
