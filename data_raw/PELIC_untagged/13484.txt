My best friend went to the same high school where I went to. He is the kind of person who always care about others. Now he lives in shanghai which is the most cosmopolitan city in China. He has a bicycle that he rides to work everyday. Sinopec which is the company my friend work for has given him a lot of opportunities to work overseas. Every time we go out together with other friends he is always the one whom get tricked but we all love him as a friend.
