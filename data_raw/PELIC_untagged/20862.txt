I hadn't done a lot of things before coming to Pittsburgh. For example I hadn't passed TOEFL test and I hadn't entered a good university. I am a person who likes playing sports. I had learned some kinds of sports. But I hadn't finished learning. I hadn't left far away from home before I came here. I was always company with my family. It's a pity that I hadn't said even once I love you to them. I plan to learn finance I really regret I hadn't learned math very well. China is a beautiful country that has very famous and beautiful places can visit. I hadn't visited many parts of China. I graduated high school last year a lot of work had to do. I hadn't had that much long rest until I came to Pittsburgh.
