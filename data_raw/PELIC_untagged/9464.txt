I am ANON_NAME_0 Last Name I was born in 1979 in Arica Chile. I was living in Arica for 14 years and then I moved to Santiago. In Santiago I live with my parent my sister and my little brother. I studied Business Engineer and MBA. Next I worked in a retail company and when I was worked I found that I needed how to speak to read to write English so I came to United State. In Pittsburgh I live with my sister we are living in Shadyside and I am learning how to cook and how to run a house . Also I am studying in a full time program in ELI. I really enjoy my time in here it fell like vacation because I am not working and I have a lot of free time. I am learning to ski with my sister last Saturday was my firth time and was so fun that I hope to come back next weekend. Been in here is a really special opportunity for me because I can know about North American culture while I learn the language.
