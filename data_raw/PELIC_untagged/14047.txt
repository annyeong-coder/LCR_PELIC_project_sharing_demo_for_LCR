Yesterday morning I woke up at 10am. I found a missed call from my friend so I called him back. He told me to find him out how he can sign up to study in the University of Pittsburgh. When we were talking I got a second call I told him to hold on for a second but he hanged up the phone. One minute later he called me back again I told him to go on the web cite of the university and pick up all the information that you need and try to figure them out and if you have any problem call me back please.
