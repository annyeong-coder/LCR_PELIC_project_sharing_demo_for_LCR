My apartment bedroom is very neat. I want this room cheer me up and make me feel comfortable in every time I enter. So I try to make it looks simple. When I just moved into this apartment I looked for a good direction for my bed because I heard about feng shui. So I looked it up on the internet. At last I moved my bed around to the South because in Thai ancient this direction is called bed's head direction . I also place my desk to a corner beside a window opposite left side part of the bed. In this way it is easy to go to the bed after I finish my homework but I have to clean it up very often because of dust from the window. There is a plug under this desk that makes me feel convenient when I want to charge up something such as my mp3 player or my cell phone. I have a bookshelf which is not too height on the left side of the desk. I straighten it up with books by putting them in group separate by size for each of shelf's level. There are two lights in this room. I place each of them on a corner opposite to each another because I want to make this room light up. I put them on a free space because I do not want anything blocks out the light. Sadly my light switch is too far from my bed that makes me feel a little bit lazy to go there for turn the light off. It is better if the switch is near the bed.
