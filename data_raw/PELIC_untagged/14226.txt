My problem was six months ago when I wanted to buy a car. This problem was that I wanted a special type of cars and a specified price . I went to exhibition cars but I did not find what I wanted. I searched by internet until found the web site called Prosline. Finally I found the car and called the owner of the car but her address was in Indiana PA. I did not have GPS and had to print the map from Google Map. When my friend and I arrived in Indiana other problem faced me the office car refused to transfer the car to me because I did not have identification card of state. In the end we found a solution the office transferred the car to my fried until I get ID. I got ID and transferred the car but after I paid two taxes.
