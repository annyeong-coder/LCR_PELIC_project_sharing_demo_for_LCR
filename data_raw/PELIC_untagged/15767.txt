I like my apartment because my apartment is very convenient. My room is so big that I have special place to hang up my clothes and pants. My roommate is also Taiwanese. She loves cooking so she often prepares dinner on the weekend. We usually clean our apartment up every week so our apartment looks very clean and warm. But sometimes our furniture is broken we should find out to fix by ourselves. Another thing is our neighbor. I do not like them because they always turn up their TV at midnight thus I cannot sleep very well. However when I go back after school I always feel lonely. Because my roommate is too busy I usually eat dinner by myself. In fact I like eating dinner with her. And also I love to get along with her. Moreover when I feel bad she always cheers me up. In addition I would like to change our living room. In our living room we do not have any furniture. Therefore my roommate and I will pick out some furniture.
