My favorite hobby is traveling. Especially traveling by driving my car. Because if you take planes or chains to travel the views always are some popular. The most beautiful view need you find it by yourself. I have BEEN TRAVELING to some views by driving my car. In US I have BEEN to NYC LosAngels and SanFrancisco but only NYC I driving. I hope I can drive my car from Pittsburgh to LosAngels one day.
