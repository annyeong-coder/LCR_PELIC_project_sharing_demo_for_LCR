I'd get my Japanese Language license in level four in two years ago. When I'd been studying in senior high school I'd interested in learning Japanese. After I'd graduated from high school I'd finally had chance to learn Japanese. Because in the high school I'd spend all of my free time to learn Chinese English Math Chemistry and Physics. Although I'd been very enthusiastic about learn Japanese language but sometimes I just feel tired. First my Japanese language center is in the Taoyaun but my university is in the Hsinchu. So I'd been going to Taoyaun by train when I'd had a Japanese class on Saturday. Second I'd pushed myself study hard in Japanese language center while my friends had been watching the movie drinking coffee at Starbucks hiking on the mountain and so on. After I'd been learning for three years my teacher had encouraged me to take a Japanese Language exam. Therefore before I'd graduated in university I'd passed the Japanese Language exam. Even if I'd felt tried while I'd been learning Japanese but I'd been glad that I'd eventually got the Japanese Language license in level four.
