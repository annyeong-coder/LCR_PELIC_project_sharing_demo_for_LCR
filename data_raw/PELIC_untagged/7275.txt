My bedroom is on the third floor of the house. There is no bed in this room. I usually sleep on a mattress which I buy from Lotus where is a big supermarket in Thailand. In this room there is a computer table which is located on the conner of the room. The wardrobe in which I put cloths is placed next to the computer table I share the wardrobe with my brother whose cloths have more than me.
