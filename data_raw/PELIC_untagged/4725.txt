The square in City Hall is regarded as the place where people take some time to be able to feel nature in the crowded center of Seoul. In front of City Hall there is the big square which is covered with grass. When the weather is fine in spring to fall you can hang out with your friends or family to the square and sit on the grass in any position you want. There has nothing special you can amuse to do in the square but you can appreciate the external appearance of buildings and City Hall. At night it's much crowded than afternoon. It's because the temperature is cooler and there is a fresh breeze which makes you feel refreshed. At this time you can have drinks not as much as you make a trouble. If you keep this rule it's a good chance to drink alcohols outside breathing an brisk air.
