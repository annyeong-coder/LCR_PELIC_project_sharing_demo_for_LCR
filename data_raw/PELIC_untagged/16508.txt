There are places at where I can have a good time and benefit from in Pittsburgh. First I visited Carnegie Library at several locations such as Oakland Squirrel Hill Downtown. They have diversified references such as astronomy math science etc. Along with that at the library it is possible to participate in different beneficial events that show library has more than a normal library do. Right after seeing its huge possessions I signed up to the library. Second I had a little trip in the Downtown and Oakland areas to look for some cafes. I saw that there are many places in the Downtown area at where I can drink something when I want to talk with my friends and to study lesson. In the Oakland area there are many places to go and spend good time as well. To sum up in Pittsburgh there are so many places to spent a good time particularly as a student. These places are suitable to study and to have a good time.
