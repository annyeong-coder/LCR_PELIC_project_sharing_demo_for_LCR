Mi favorite place to eat lunch every day is the most beatiful and cheaper restaurant that I had found. In this place located a few bloks of Pitt I choose my own menu every day. Some of salad meat o chiken and a delicious dessert is my daily diet. I try to avoid eating fat food nevertheless I eat often high calories food. Usually I don't take a second chance for food but this possibility is always open. Maybe you are thinking that It's impossible to find a place like this because mi favorite place is my home.
