I think that her advices are all good. The most I like is Do not disclose too much personal information because I believe the same idea. People shouldn't know their numbers backround and more before they meet. Also like her advise which is about do get specific in your online profil. This is the truth because if we tell them lies when we meet with the person they will know that we lied them. It is not good between two people . For me I prefer say the truth when I am talking with someone on the computer . Internet is unlimited area and we can say whatever we want but we have to think that when they realiza that we lied them they are not going to trust . Finally I like her advices and I am agree with her.
