I met good friends in pittsburgh. One is a boy who comes from china and his name is ANON_NAME_0. Initially we met in the class that was in Point Park. He is younger than me but we don't care about age. The other friend is a girl who also comes from china. She who is also younger than me and I met in Starbucks that I usually went to. ANON_NAME_0 introduced her to me in there. Last month ANON_NAME_0 left to another state. And she came back to china. I miss them so much now.
