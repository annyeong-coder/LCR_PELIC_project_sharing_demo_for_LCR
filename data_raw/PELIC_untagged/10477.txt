Travel around the world get married have two kids. Paid attention to my kids education work with one of the big org. In the world. Help my kids to become better adult. Good things usually come with hard work. When I was growing up I have some expectation I wanted to achieve. I wanted to work in a big organisation. I work hard in school to achieve my goal. I had a chance to work with the UNESCO for five years. I traveled around the world I visited many countries. I got married had two kids as I plan it. Now I focus on my kids education. I think I am doing my best because they always get good grads at school. This year one of my expectation just happen . My son was choose as an National out sanding student.
