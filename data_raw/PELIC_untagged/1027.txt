Oct 22 06 Dear Michiko I want to get Japanese cosmetics because these are better for my skin than American cosmetics. Three days ago I bought a lipstick that was made in America and put it on. At first it seemed good for me because the color suited me and it had moisture. However shortly after that my lip got rough. This is the main reason why I want to get Japanese cosmetics. American cosmetics are bad for my skin. In addition Japanese cosmetics have more kinds of lipsticks than American cosmetics because they have stronger ingredients than Japanese cosmetics. Moreover they have more suitable color for Japanese. So I want to get Japanese cosmetics especially a lipstick. Would you get and send me Japanese cosmetics If you can visit I'd enjoy seeing you again. I hope we will meet next spring! Love
