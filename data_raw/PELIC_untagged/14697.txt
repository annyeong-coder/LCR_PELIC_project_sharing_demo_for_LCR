I went to my friend's apartment last night. Actually he should have been in the room because we made a plan to cook a diner. I knocked her door many times yet called her many times. I thought she might have been sick therefore she could not have heard mines. Finally I gave up and walked back my room. While I was waking home I saw her. She was in Chinese restaurant. I am one of optimistic people so I thought she might have been buying some food for us. I walked to her and talked to her. She said she completely forgot our plan. Oh! My gods! She was killing me!
