I used to live in a willage when I was a young person but I live in the second biggest city where is the capital of Turkey. I used to go to mountain pasture high plateu every summer until when I was 20 years old but in recent years I work every summer so I don't go there. I used to swim into walley every day except winter until ten years ago but I swim once or twice a month this days. I used to smoke until I got married. I afraid of mywife so I don't smoke anyhow. I used toride bicycle alot when I was child but I don't have a bicycle now so I don't ride it. I didn't use to earn money when I was child because I didn't use to work but I earn money enough now.
