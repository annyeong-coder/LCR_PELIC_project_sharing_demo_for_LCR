In my opinion online dating is not a best way getting married but can be a friend. First of all many people have different cultures. For example two mouths ago I met a girl at online but the first thing she asked me if I smoke and drink a beer. I said no and she left without bye bye. . She did not give a chance to impress her. Another reason I did not apply my self for online dating because it's west time and long. In fact if I would like to meet someone I have to in the club or in the street that's all. I think I'm eligible o find a girl and having a good time. In addition I won't put my profile in the internet also I'm a person rigid that's why I talk with people I know . Finally because of culture time and profile I don't need to date online.
