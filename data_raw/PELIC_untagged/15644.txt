I have tasted a bitter failure in my life which means that I should have followed my inner voice and done the advice at that time. Every time I remember the failure I wish I had obeyed my inner voice. It was more than 10 years ago that the failure occurred. When I was a university student I saw and fell in love with a female student sitting a bench in the campus. She was cute and looked innocent. For a while she suddenly began to cry. My intuition told me to cheer her up by saying something but I could not do that. Next day my friend told me about the girl whom he also saw yesterday and told me that he cheered her up went to have dinner with her and then became her boyfriend. If I had said something to her when she was crying I could have been her boyfriend. Moreover if I had not seen her I would not have been so jealous of him when I heard his love story. Now I wish I met a crying lady in a campus.
