I made a Taiwanese beef stew successfully last Sunday. I had been trying almost 10 times before I finally made a tasty delicious beef stew. The difficult part of this dish was not how to cook it but how to make it soft chewy and strongly flavored. In addition I really wanted to make it as delicious as my mother had cooked for me before. Although I had already asked my mother the tips before I made it I still failed several times. By the time I succeeded I had tried several ways and methods to try to figure out the secrets to success. I was very dejected and I really didn't get it. However I would not give up. Finally I decided to use brown sugar instead of white sugar and another seasoning and I did it. I have never felt so happy and sorrowful at the same time because when I ate the most delicious beef stew it also evoked the feeling that I left my own hometown and my dearest father and mother. Ever since that success I have been cooking the beef stew and making it perfectly during the week.
