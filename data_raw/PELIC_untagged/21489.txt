My name is ANON_NAME_0. I was bon in Istanbul Turkey. I love maths and science so I prefer o be an engineer. After my undergraduate I got a job. After a while I saw that I need a good english to communicate with foreign companies at my job. I came to United States to learn English as m second language and get a high score in Toefl test. With these goals I joined an English Langage Program in University of Pittsburgh named ELI.
