I'd like to talk about Roh Moo Hyun the President of South Korea. His tenure is almost expired he is going to retire only three weeks later. Recently it is alleged that he has greatly damaged the economy of Korea. However I disagree with that. I think he is the best President throughout the history of Korean democracy. Five years ago he became the President of Korea very dramatically. It was not believed that he was able to be the President because he does not have a bachelor's degree. He graduated from only a high school. However despite severe attack of the conservative force he became the President. Before becoming the President he had helped many poor people as a lawyer. In addition 17 years ago he was the only Congressman who was opposed to the anti democratic rally of the political parties. At that time it was very dangerous behavior in that Korea was politically democratically and economically unstable. He has a really strong faith and does not compromise with wrong insistence even though he gets hurt. That is why he is said to be 'foolish Roh Moo Hyun' a very ironical expression. After becoming the President he tried to make a radical reform of media firstly especially conservative newspapers because the major newspapers of Korea are too powerful and too conservative. It is considered that they are the biggest obstacle to develop democracy in Korea. However his attempt failed. Because of this the major newspapers have denounced all of his policies and trials during his whole tenure. Nowadays because of the long term slanted newspapers many people blame him and even jeer him. However actually he has made Korean economy and democracy more develop. I admire his brave behavior and strong faith. It is said by some people that he is the most underrated President of Korea. I believe that he will be regarded as the most respectable President of Korea in a few years.
