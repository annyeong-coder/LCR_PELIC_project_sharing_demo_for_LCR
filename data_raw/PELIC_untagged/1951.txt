Negotiation is an important thing to me as a consumer when I want to buy goods. I don't pay the asking price to the seller because he will give me a higher price than the real one. For example one day I went to the mall that has a lot of shops. I found a good suit but it's too expensive. I talked to the seller about the price yet he said this is the final price for this suit. I tell him if he gave a discount I will take it. He refused that offer. When I went to the front door he called me and said OK. You can take it with your price but I didn't talk to him because I want a less price. After that he said OK. What do you want I said I want it with a half price. He looked me for a half minute and said no problem you can take it now. I wish if I said I want it with a quarter price but I couldn't say any thing because I told the price that I want. In conclusion you have to bargain the sellers about the price because they usually give you cheap goods with higher price than the real price.
