Taiwan was called Formosa a Portuguese word meaning beautiful land. But Day after day the environment of island has been destroyed due to its mountains has been over exploration and over logging without conservation. For this reason a landslide is a serious environmental issue there now. Each time while earthquake or typhoon with abundant rainfall comes it always not only causes a large amount of rocks falling down from a cliff or the side of a mountain but also would cause flood disaster. For example a terrible earthquake happened in the 21th of September 2000 in Taiwan the landslide killed a lot of people and destroyed a lot of houses. So recently our government starts to take environmental conservation seriously in case of the landslide happens again in Taiwan
