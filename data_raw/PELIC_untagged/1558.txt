My success on blind typing Now I still think my fluent blind typing was a success. Nowadays blind typing is very normal but when we had computers in the early 1990s most of us couldn't do it well. There were three reasons that I could do blind typing successfully. First I changed my thoughts. I thought that I needn't type blindly in the beginning because I wasn't a typist. However I found that I couldn't use the computer quickly if I didn't type blindly. So I made a decision to learn blind typing. Second I installed the typing software on my computer. I followed the shows in the software to put my fingers on the keyboard and began to study blind typing step by step. At first I made the progress very slowly and sometimes I even wanted to quit because it's very hard and boring. Fortunately I didn't give up. I persisted in practicing and I practiced 10 minutes each time and twice every day. Finally I could type much faster than before. Third I played some games about typing on the computer. I could get some scores in the games. If you want to get a high score you must type fast and this made the typing interesting. Two weeks later I could type very faster and correctly.
