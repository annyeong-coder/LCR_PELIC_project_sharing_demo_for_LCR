I will describe my fiancee who I think I need more than one week to talk about the beautiful things that she has. She lives in Jazan which is my hometown. She loves reading books that is about relationships. My fiancee who loves me a lot is a librarian. She loves Pittsburgh where I am studying. I remember the day when I saw her. I lost my heart that day. She is the one who stole it.
