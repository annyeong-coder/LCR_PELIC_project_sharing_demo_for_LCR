Young people's life In China many young people have a difficult life. A lot of young people are illiterate. They don't like to study but they like to play and drink. This is the problem. Most young people don't have knowledge so they can't earn much money. This problem is bad for their lives. For instance if they don't have much money they can't buy something they need to use like about mp3 laptop and shoes. Many young people don't have good culture. For example they always say bad words and don't care about environment. Most people already know that something is wrong but they always do that. For example the people like to drink a lot and fight with somebody the young people don't listen to their parents' advice. These are big problems for modern young people in China.
