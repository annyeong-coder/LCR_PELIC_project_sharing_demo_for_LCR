All people work but they have different work. People should work because they need in their life and also they will when they don't have work how they can life. For example if anyone doesn't have any work they can't fine any food. People most improve their life so they should have work. Therefore when they have any problem in your house you don't fine anyone to fix it. If people don't have work they will have many problems. First they will have more and more poor people so the world will not save. Second they will have a bored life because they don't have any things to do . Finally the life will be massy because that it is don't have anyone work such as clean wash etc. The work is very impotent in the life because people can't life if they don't have any work.
