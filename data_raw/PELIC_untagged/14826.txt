When I was in the third month of pregnancy I was involved in a car accident by a woman who practiced her car with her husband for getting driver's license. It was terrible! My car was being gone straight at the intersection and her car was being broken into my line. At that moment an accident happened. I was so surprised and could not move. But her husband walked to me How do you drive Are you mad What next I answered. He insisted it was my fault. I just could not find the words. A man who was treated the sight came to me and said Don't worry. Call a policeman. I can be a witness if you need. Thank to the man I could solve the problem. Finally my car was towed and I had to go hospital for examination. Of course my baby was safe.
