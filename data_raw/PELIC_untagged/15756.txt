I respect my father because he was preeminent in human relations. He was always busy to meet his friends colleagues and neighbors and he prudently made friends at new places. He frequently insisted that I get along with my friends and all the people who I would meet. The reason is that people is the invaluable property while I am living my life in that they have possibility to help me at any time. For example when my father passed away his acquaintances came to the funeral and helped all the rite and gave regrettable condolence to my family. Some people really lamented the loss of my father. After I witnessed this I thought the relationship with my acquaintances deeply. Indeed when I experience hardship who would help me spontaneously I am not sure how many people readily relieve my suffering. Perhaps if I would treat my friends seriously they will give their hands to me when I go through adversity. Therefore it is essential that we keep good relationship with friends during our lives.
