In my bedroom there are many things that I make feel very good. For example there is a phone in my bedroom and I can hang it up when my family call me. I have a lamp next to my bed. When I need to light the bedroom I like to turn it on. I have a laptop and I use it on my desk. Sometimes I have to look my homeworks up by internet. Everyday I like to straighten my bedroom up however my bedroom is desorganized I don't let in to my girlfriend and I keep her out to my bedroom in this conditions. I think to go on living in this house because it is confortable and I don't think to give it up for the moment. The enviroment of this bedroom cheer me up.
