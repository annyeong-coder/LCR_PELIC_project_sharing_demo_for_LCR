I believe that wearing religious clothing is a human right as well as it should belong to be one of the religious freedom. Regarding to the French government about the current situation they should try to find out the best solution. For example if these organizations imposed the women to wear jilbab they should ask them to follow what their religion says about this kind of problem. In other words advising women to wear jilbab is a part of Islamic religion at first step by using a good method or procedure like some Islamic countries follow that but imposing them needs a good Islamic scholar to answer question like this.
