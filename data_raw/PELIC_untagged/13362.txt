In my opinion the author wants to emphasis effects of tour to environment. This is because he is former environment editor of The Independent on Sunday. In this article I think consumer means people who buy products and use for their wants. They don't care about environment if they spend their money. Therefore I think the author talks about consumer instead of tourist .
