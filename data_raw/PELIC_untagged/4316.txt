The traffic problem can be resolved in several ways. First of all Rising the cost that relate to the car. For example increasing the tax for the car price can reduce the number of car. I think that if the price is too high so people don't want to pay much money to buy many cars one car is enough for one family . Furthermore another key to resolve this problem is organized the public transportation. I recommend developing new technology for transporting faster and more safe. People will satisfy that and use it if they can reach the destination faster than using their own cars. Finally I suggest sharing car with the members of your family or your neighbors if they use the same ways as you. For instance your neighbors work nearby you you and your neighbors can schedule that when uses your car and when uses their car.
