When I moved to Pittsburgh I never thought about snow and the consequences in my new life. Before I moved here I had never seen the snow and when I saw my first snowfall it was one of the most important experiences in my life. This was spectacular the changes on the streets parks trees and houses. Everything looked white like a carpet and I felt if I were inside of a Christmas ornament. After that I went to seven springs to sky. This was my first time. It was a magnificent time that I shared with my friends. I felt the wind in my face freezing my cheeks but the most important thing was to descend around the mountain and to slide in your skies. Before I bought the winter clothes I had never felt this kind of cold it was terrible for me because I didn't know what the real cold was like. This was very important that when I was in my country in never felt the cold because our temperature is 80 to 85 degrees every day.
