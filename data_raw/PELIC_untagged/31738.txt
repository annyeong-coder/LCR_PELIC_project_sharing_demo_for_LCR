I finally got a chance to be on the reality show lost on ocean . We're going to go to a desert island on the Pacific Ocean to film the show. They told me that I have to bring along three items that I'd need the most on the island. I think a knife should be a great tool to use there especially for hunting and cutting things. I was thinking of taking some matches to make a fire but should! I learned how to make a fire by rubbing two sticks together last summer so I'd better not take them with me. I can also take a flashlight along with some batteries at least when it gets dark I'll be able to see my way. The last item is a Desalination machine so that I can drink water easily. I don't think it'll be hard to use it since it can be used by solar power. I've got to win this show to be famous and rich.
