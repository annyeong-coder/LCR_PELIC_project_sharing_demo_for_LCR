I think that cooking is my successful thing. I remember I could cook when I was 10. At that time my parents both were busy. They always went back late. Sometimes I was very hungry after they had cooked. So I began to learn about how to cook. The first meal that I cooked was very terrible taste. I could not eat it but my father encouraged me and told me how to cook. He was good at cooking. He could cook many delicious food. He would teach me how to cook if he was free. I was interesting in cooking. So I often cooked for my family. I have read a lot of books about cooking since then. Now I can cook many different food.
