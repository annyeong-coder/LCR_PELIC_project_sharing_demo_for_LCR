Last weekend I should have written an essay for my writing class. On Friday night I should have gone to Monroeville to celebrate Vicky's birthday. I should not have drunk so much beer lead to sleep too late at Saturday morning. At Saturday night I could have gone to the Squirrel Hill library to write my essay. When I was walking on Murray Avenue I saw my friend Carol. I should have talked with her for a while at coffee shop. When I was conscious of going to the library the sky was getting dark. It was too late to go to the library. I should not have watched the football game on time at Saturday night. I could have copied to video to see later. On Sunday morning I should have slept in to mow the lawn in my back yard. After that I run out of my energy. I should have slept at least three hours. After I work up I wrote a terrible essay. I wonder I could have managed my time well.
