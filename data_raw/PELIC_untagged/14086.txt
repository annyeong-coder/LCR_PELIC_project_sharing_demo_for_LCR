I got my Interior design license 6 months ago. This license is only for interior designer. Before I got it I practiced drafting of interior design more 3 hours per day for 6 months. It was hard training for me but this license must be gotten by designer. I had been worrying about the practical technique test because I had ever failed test one time. I drawn draft line carefully and fast while taking test. Finally I confirmed my name on line I was so happy.
