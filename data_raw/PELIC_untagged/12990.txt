I was born in Hokkaido Japan in 1978. However my family moved to Yokohama when I was 2 years old. That's why I grew up in Yokohama 1 hour outside from Tokyo. I was interested in Chemistry since I was a little girl. I studied Pharmacy at the college so that I could get my job easily. I worked as a pharmacist for 6 years. After that I got married and came to Pittsburgh.
