Hi I'm Klein Last Name . I have been recording my life in America on this site since I came here. I come from Taiwan and I grew up in Tainan. Tainan is a wonderful city of rich culture in Taiwan. After I graduated from college in Taiwan I came to Pittsburgh. I have been living in Pittsburgh since January this year. I thought everything for me is new when I just came here and I would like to write something about my life. I have written several diaries this month. I also took some pictures and I have already uploaded them on my site. There are not lots of stuff on my site now but I have planned to put more things on it. You can leave your message for me if you have any question or you would like to tell me anything.
