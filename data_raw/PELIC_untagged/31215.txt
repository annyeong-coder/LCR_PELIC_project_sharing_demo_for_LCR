From my perspective I go along with Vande Berg to use the chimpanzees and other primates in medical experiments. Because of people's lives is very significant I said that. There are a lot of people who have epidemic diseases such as hepatitis B C and HIV so they need a medicine to treat from these diseases. Consequently the chimpanzees and other primates are the best animals to do medical research. At the same time we must maintain chimpanzees and other primates by taking care of them and putting specific number to do medical experiments per year. Because the chimpanzees and other primate's lives are very important too we should be doing that.
