I have been most influenced by my best friend with whom I spent my school days. She was always filled with positive energy and used to encourage other people to have an affirmative attitude. Including those things she let me have a religion which takes up a considerable part of my life at present. Maybe it would be no exaggeration to say that my values were formed by time to spend with her. Above all I was helped by her as facing the difficulty that I had to change my job in those days. Moreover the main reason why I came to Pittsburgh is that she gave me great encouragement to study English. I have ever heard about friendship like this Friendship needs a certain parallelism of life a community of thought a rivalry of aim. I am still inspired to make headway toward my aim by her. She is just like this friend.
