This article is so impressive in sportsmanship. The man who lost his mother came to the game and said It just only one problem and he desired to play in the game. However according to the rule it would give the other competitor two free throws but Dekalb the other team did not want to do. However it was not competitors agreement it was based on referees' consideration. The referees could not agree with both teams because it is the rule everyone has to follow it. Finally Dekalb's volunteer McNeal pretend to miss the shoot to show that Dekalb did not want two point from putting the man who just lost his mother in the second half game. AWESOME! COOL!
