I lived in Tripoli where I grew up and I remember the school which name is Adrees it was a good school. Last week I met my classmate who I known from a long time. I remember teacher ANON_NAME_0 who taught us in math he was good teacher. I do not forget the garden where we were relaxed in. I like the semester when we got A .
