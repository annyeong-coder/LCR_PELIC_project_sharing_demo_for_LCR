I had never learned how to swimming before I got drowning in the swimming pool. When I was learning swimming my teacher stayed by our side in case we got drowning. By the time we had learned swimming for 2 months so my classmates and I thought we can swimming by ourselves. We started swim and our teacher waited for us at the final side. When I had been swimming till the middle of the swimming pool I felt tired so I stopped swimming to take a rest. But I had forgot that middle of the pool is the deepest place so I could not touch the floor and I started getting nervous! I could not stopped drinking water and I had been continuing to raise my hands up for a while. After my classmate found me I did not back to the final side my teacher had seen me ask for help he swam quickly to save me to the pool edge. After this happened I had known that do not try to do anything before you totally already learned it.
