This is a story about some surgery interns. Meredith Cristina George and Izzie are in the same group. Their supervising doctor is very strict and gives them many rules. All of them met difficulties at first. For example George got the chance to perform an appendectomy but he didn't complete. Cristina really wanted to do an operation and almost got the chance. She and Meredith helped the attending doctor make the correct diagnosis for a patient in critical condition but the doctor decided to give the chance to Meredith but not Cristina. Cristina was angry and sad. Fortunately this situation didn't hurt their friendship. After the first 48 hour shift they were exhausted and they experienced complicated emotions. However they reaffirmed their devotion to medicine.
