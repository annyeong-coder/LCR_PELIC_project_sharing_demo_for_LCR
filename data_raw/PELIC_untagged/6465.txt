Work is the source of live. Living in a world designed for work. In order to stop suffering we have to work. Every person has different reasons for working. The reasons for working are as individual as the person. But we all work because we obtain something that we need from work. However this is not the only reason that people work the most important motivational aspect of work for people can be divided into two groups money and Knowledge. However almost everyone works for money. It is true that most people do work to spend money on their activities. Money pays the bills. Money provides housing gives children clothing and food sends teens to college and allows activities and eventually retirement. To underplay the importance of money and benefits to people who work is a mistake. The work prouduces the Knowledge and help you for getting a new informations every day. For example I want to do some creative work. That's why I prefer to try new things. I have this quality therefore I chose science background and now I am in research field. In this field everyday I have some creative work to do. I try new things everyday. In this field there is no need of hand skills. Knowledgments will always come if people want to do new things. In new work sometimes it can be possible that I will not be able to find success. Even then I will prefer to do new work. I will prefer to try new things because I want to get knowledge. This is not only for me but also for each and every person who wants to get knowledge. People who have good skills to do things should prefer to do same work. I prefer different work. I feel happy if I face challenges in my work. Finally I would like say I will be happy if I a good jop and I will feel by my self.
