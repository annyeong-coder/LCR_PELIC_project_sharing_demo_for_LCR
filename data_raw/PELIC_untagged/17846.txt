There are several suggestions to separate from Jim. If you have a serious problem which selects one of the alternatives you should concern about your family first. For example if you cannot contact with your parents they should be sad. They really would like to talk with a son in low feel free. If you will get married a foreigner they cannot keep in touch with him. It is impossible to live being happy without parents. I think you just fell in love with him such a movie so you have to take a cool view of things. The moment you separate from him you may be painful. After a few lapses you will be fine. You are a young and attractive girl so you can see anybody soon. If you separated from Jim you are able to keep good memories about him. You have gotten experience to dating American guy. It is also valuable memory in your life. Don't be sad. You just keep your good memory in the U. S. Your parents really love you they are willing to support you. You should obey your parents' perspective because it is a duty. Though you communicate with Jim's parents well your parents cannot do that. In my opinion the wedding might connects one culture with another culture. If you are well known for American culture your parents really do not know American culture. If you get married Jim your parents and parents in low suffer from culture shock. I recommend hanging out with Jim freely until you leave in the U. S. You just keep good memories you should separate from him. After you leave in the States you have to adjust to your hometown. You should be busy for a while it would be helpful to forgetting him. You can also participate in Japanese party or club in order to finding a new boyfriend. Hopefully everything will be fine. Please don't ignore your parents!
