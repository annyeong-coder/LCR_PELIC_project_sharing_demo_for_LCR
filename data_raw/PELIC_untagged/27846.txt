When I was young I used to have short hair. Since I was young I have left my hair. When I was 3 years I used to cry. Since I grew up I have not cried. When I was 6 I used to heat school. Since I was in elementary school I have loved school. When I was in high school I was sensitive. Sinc I grew up I have continued to be sensitive. In Riyadh I didn't use to cook . Sinc I came here I have cooked .
