Some time in the last september I looked around Pittsburgh with my Korean friends. I was driving a car. Suddenly the police followed my car. We were so afraid because whether I'll get a ticket or not mattered to us. I parked the car at the side and the police officer came to us. I've watched many American movies that people who face our situation raise their hands. So I insisted that we had to raise our hands. We did! At first the police officer was surprised and he started laughing. He said that we didn't need to raise our hands. What's so funny was our reply. We replied No! Because We saw this situation at the movies all the times! The police officer didn't stop laughing. He said that we were so funny and he wasn't going to give us the ticket. We were relived because he didn't charge us the ticket! It was so scared experience although now I can laugh about that.
