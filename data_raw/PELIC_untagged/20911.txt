I had never visited a museum before I came to Pittsburgh. So when I came I visited Carnegie Museum. I had never gone to a bar in Saudi Arabia but when I came here I went to bar to drink some wine especially red wine because I heard and read about some advantages of drinking wine. Wine can decrease the cholesterol level in the blood. I had never seen a green forest before coming here. I saw it only on the TV but not in the reality until I came to the United States.
