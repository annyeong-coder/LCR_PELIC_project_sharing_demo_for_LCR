Henry Lanh Last Name June 10 2008 The writing Process Ch. 6 I think music is very important in my life. I uasually listen to music when I feel sad. It makes me feel more energize and reduce stress. I like to listen to romantic music which is slowly and I can feel spirit from the songs from the singers. My favorite singer is Richard Marx who wrote and sang some famous songs such as Right here waiting for you Now and Forever Who killed Mary Don't mean nothing Should've know better At the beginning etc My favorite song is Now and forever a song start with guitar voice very very romantic then he start to sing Whenever I'm weary from the battles rage in my head. You made sense of madness when my sanity hangs by a thread Until the day the ocean doesn't touch the sand I will be you man this song is really beautiful. Sometimes I also listen to some dance music and another music.
