Hi my name is ANON_NAME_0 Last Name . My cousin ANON_NAME_1 sent me information about Facebook and I am learning about it. I have written this letter to introduce myself in Facebook. I have always been a people person and I am not shy at all. I grew up in Santa Marta next to the beach so my family did many outside activities like hiking swimming and exploring. Actually I have been doing these activities with my kids and they seem to enjoy them. Ever since we went to Orlando Florida last summer our family has been talking about the wonderful time we had there. Since I got married I have been painting my house. First I painted a mural in my sons' room six years ago and it took me 6 months to finish the project. Afterwards I painted the rest of the house last year and I did it room by room. Now I am planning to do a new mural for my kids' room. You can see the picture of the kids and me painting in their room. On the right side you can see Marco. He is seven years old and he has been playing piano since 2004. Patrick is on the left side of the picture and he is four years old. He has been playing piano since 2007. They went to swimming lessons last year and they really liked them too. On mother's day last year my kids surprised me when they cooked cleaned and bought flowers for me that day. They had grown so much!
