Dear Mr. ANON_NAME_0 I am a student at the EFL Computer Training Institute. My classes are very good but I think that there are a lot of things you should do. First at all you had better clean the trash. Then you should fix the celling. Next you ought to bring a new chair for the man who uses the computer. After that you had better fix the window. Finally you should repair the copier.
