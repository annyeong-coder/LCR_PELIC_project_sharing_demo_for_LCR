Causes of happiness They said that money can buy happiness. But is it real !. It's true if I have money I can buy anything I want. But to achieve happiness there are a lot of factors other than money. Though money mostly is the source of everything . Like for example lately I've been in money crises because I didn't get the scholarship yet. So of course having the scholarship means that all my payments will be covered and the source of that is the money. Therefore I'll be the happiest person in the world in that moment. Being successful also can make anyone happy and self confidence. It could happen when getting promotion at work. Or getting a job with a big position like being the chief of residents in a hospital or being a manager of a big company. All of these can make anyone happy but with a lot of responsibilities. In addition being in a good health make me happy and secure when I see sick people especially in my field when I was working in the hospital. I feel what if I don't have my health and being sick all the time . I'll be miserable because of the pain and the dependence on other people. So thank God for being healthy. Also having family is a big gift from God. When I see the orphans or people without family I feel sad about them because I really appreciate having my family and being surrounded by them make me feel happy and safe. Like when my mom gets worried about me and taking care of me. Also my dad with his kindness and hard working to earn money for us. In conclusion we can see that money can cause happiness but not the happiness itself. Happiness can be achieved even through the poorest person in the world if that one is satisfy about his or her life.
