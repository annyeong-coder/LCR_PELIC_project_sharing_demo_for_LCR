4. Ultimate state of creativity is called flow. It is a period of time when you loose control of time being engaged in activity you really like. The last time I experienced flow was one year ago. I decided to translate one Polish novel called I love you into English. It took me about 2 days and I really enjoyed doing that. I was amazed by the beautiful language that the author used in this novel. I was unaware of time and things happening around me. I fully enjoyed translating it. I think that everyone should find some time to do what they really like. And you don't have to create anything in order to experience flow It just comes when you start doing an activity you like! As for schools I think that there should be different classes for students who are interested in music literature or art in every school so that those students can attend them.
