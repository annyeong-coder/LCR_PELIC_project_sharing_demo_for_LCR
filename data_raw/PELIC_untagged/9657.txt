I am going to visit Washington DC after the ELI semester ends. For this travel I will prepare something. First I am going to buy a GPS and learn how use this GPS. Then I will read some books about Washington DC. When I am ready I am going to leave. In Washington DC I am going to visit White House and Lincoln Memorial. I will spend one week for this trip. I hope I will have a good trip.
