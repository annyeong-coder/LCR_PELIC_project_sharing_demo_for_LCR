I have some suggestion for you. Now you MUST change yourself. First you OUGHT TO exercise everyday. It WILL make you feel better and even you WILL get such a healthy body. Second you HAVE TO try not to be lazy. Third you HAD BETTER reduce smoking. Finally you SHOULD find another new job. You CAN find another new job if you're changed so you DON'T HAVE TO be worried too much. You CAN do it.
