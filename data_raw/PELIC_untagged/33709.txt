ANON_NAME_0 my soul mate who is really a nice boy. When we were senior high school students he helped me many times. For example I hated math which is a troublesome subject for me ANON_NAME_0 always encouraged me to try again. If I got bad grades he corrected my paper and taught me how to answer. After we graduated we weren't in the same universities but we still kept in touch. We often meet in PAUL where is a famous restaurant to talk about our university life. We couldn't stop talking even it was 11 00pm. He always knows what I am thinking about or I want. I still remember two years ago when my ex boyfriend broke up with me he asked me to do something to forget the bad thing and he was with me everyday. He told me if I felt sad or unhappy I would tell him he can solve the problem. Although I am in the U. S where is very far from Taiwan he still call me every week I also have a lot of interesting things want to tell him. He is a friend who really close my life and heart.
