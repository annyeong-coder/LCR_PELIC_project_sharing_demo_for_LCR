After the crane collapsed and hurt many people Dr. House went to the accident scene to rescue victims. He sent the crane operator to ambulance when he heard a sound. Then he started searching the sound. After a while he found a trapped woman was down the debris and a rock pinned her right leg. Another doctor Lisa suggested to amputate but House refused. Then they tried to use a lift to lift the rock but it caused secondary collapse. Lisa argued with House and told them he just make the decision by his emotion. After that House adapted his opinions and convinced the woman to amputate her leg. When she was sent to hospital she suffered embolism from her amputating leg. Finally she died and House was angry that he did everything right but she died in anyway. Therefore Lisa soothed House that was not his fault and told him she refused to move out and still love him.
