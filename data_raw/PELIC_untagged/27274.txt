The sun the children whispered has gone . Margot look at the sky and it begins raining now. Margot seems very upset and whispered seven years I wait for the sun for seven years. Margot keep looking to the sky and the raining suddenly she begins to cry like a bomb all her emotion transform to tears. Look the sun is my dream whispered Margot. But I miss the opportunity.
