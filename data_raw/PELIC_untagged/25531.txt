When I was in high school I used to get up 7 00. Then I used to eat breakfast before I went to school. Howere when I lived in Pittsburgh I did not use to eat breakfast. I finished my school I used to go to my home. When I was in high school I used to use the cellphone. But now I usually use the cellphone.
