In my case I think that I could save more utilities in my daily life because I always forget turning off a TV shutting down my laptop. Why don't I do that Sometimes I think that I'll stay away from my laptop for a few minutes and it's not a great deal of money that I need to pay. Moreover I'm too lazy to shut it down because if I want to turn it on again it takes much time to boot because my laptop is quite old. One more thing that makes me familiar with leaving my laptop open is my roommates. Both of them always keep their laptop on all of the time when having a meal or going out. In order to economize on utilities I should start with manipulating my using laptop's habit. Even though it might spend plenty of time to change its result might help me reducing a lot of money that I have to pay for utilities.
