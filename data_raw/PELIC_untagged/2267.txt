Hi I'm ANON_NAME_0. I've been living in U. S. Since August 2006. I was born in Saudi Arabia. This is the first time I've been in U. S. And I hope to enjoy here. I graduated from university in 2000 and I worked as a librarian. In 2005 I had a new job in university as a teacher's assistant for a year then I came to U. S. I've played soccer with my friends in my country. I've been here to study master and PhD. I came here with my wife and my son. I've been interested in history and poetry. I used to read a lot of books in history in Arabic. Now I've read books in English to improve my second language.
