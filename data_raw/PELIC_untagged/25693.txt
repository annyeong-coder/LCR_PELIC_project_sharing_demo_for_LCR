Obviously I BIAS toward studying English in the U. S. Because it is more efficient than studying English in my country. Because in the U. S my English teachers are a native English speaker their teaching language certainly is English and their thoughts about the grammar and the sentence structure are all in typical English ways. I can learn real America English in my classes. Unlike the American English teachers my Chinese English teachers are a native Chinese speaker their teaching language certainly is Chinese and their thoughts about the grammar and the sentence structure less or more are in Chinese English ways. On the other hand in the U. S English is the official language and I read and hear English everywhere. I must speak English when I go to a bank a school or a hospital. In those learning circumstances I promote my English skills faster. In spite of these differences these two group teachers have some similar approaches in instruction. There are several interesting PARALLELS between them. First not only Chinese English teachers but also American English teachers have a PHILOSOPHY that students should do many homework given by the teachers. Secondly Chinese English teachers believe that English grammar is crucial for second language learners likewise American English teachers think that English grammar is important and they teach the grammar through the courses of English grammar English writing English listening and English speaking. Right now my English skills have had obvious progresses. I ATTRIBUTE the progresses to my beloved ELI teachers I also attribute the progresses to my beloved Chinese English teachers who brought me into the English world.
