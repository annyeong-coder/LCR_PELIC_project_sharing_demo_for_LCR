Sometimes a little friend is a great friend Three years ago my friends and I spent five days of vacation in the mountains. We rented a car to arrive there but the car was compact and short. During the trip it started to snow and our car didn't have winter tires. Therefore we were forced to put the chains to the tires. All my friends were higher than me so I was their little friend . I was capable of putting the chains and we could leave again before a freak snowstorm started. Two thousand miles missed to our desired mountain chalet. Unfortunately when only 50 miles missed something on the way got stuck under our car and we were forced to stop along the lane. The snowstorm was not finished and I went out the car in order to see what was happened. I saw a big rock and I was capable to remove it quickly. Finally we reached the chalet and had dinner while we were sitting at the fireside. My friends celebrated me and told me that without my presence our vacation was not the same.
