My bicycle trip with my father was very impressive for me when I was the sixth form in elementary school. The starting point was Sanbon in Korea where my family have lived. We were planning that we were going to travel to Chuncheon. After a while I felt frustrated about this challenge. I even wanted to give up. After we got Chuncheon two days later we had ribs of chicken which is famous in Korea. I think eating after exercising is always delicious. A couple of hours later my mother picked us up and took us home. The unforgettable memory will stay with me as a happy trip.
