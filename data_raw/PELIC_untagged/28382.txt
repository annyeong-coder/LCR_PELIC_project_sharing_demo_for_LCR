I remember carefully how my childhood bedroom was. It was the place where I had a lot of beautiful memories. I was sharing that room with my two eldest sisters . So there were three beds. My bed was near the corner which had our dresser. My eldest sister had a bed that was near the window. Our window was on the side where we were able to see our backyard. Also there was a bed of my second sister which was opposite of our closet. I remember the day when my young sister joined us. So we added a new bed which was near of mine. It was a bed whose color was different from us. Also my young sister was the last person whom I welcomed because she was so messy. She was whom I shared desk with. My eldest sister whose books were everywhere was interested in reading.
