If I want to save extra money for a special trip there are some tips for me to save money as quickly as possible. First of all I will keep records of my daily expenses. If I do so I can figure out where my money goes and have a clear idea how to control my money. Secondly I will make a list whenever I go shopping. Usually I go shopping without planning so sometimes I bought something that I didn't really need. Therefore if I list things I really need and are essential before shopping I can avoid some unnecessary expenses. Furthermore I will stop any luxurious activities such as watching movies buying clothes eating at costly restaurants etc. Finally I will try buying a few lotteries to take a chance. If I win a large amount of money then I don't have to worry about saving money!
