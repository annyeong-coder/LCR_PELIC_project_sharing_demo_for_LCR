It is debatable whether people work because they need money to live. Some people believe money is the most important fact in real world. However I disagree with the idea that money is the biggest reason to work for two reasons. First I believe that people work for their personal development. Second people work for social network. To begin with I firmly believe that a job helps people to achieve their personal development. That is we can find out their strengthen aspect through the work and they fulfill their dream. For example when I worked for Korea Telecom which is the biggest internet and mobile company in South Korea I was a project leader. My team made new security system and we serviced to people. This service got a lot of compliments from clients and my coworkers. However it was not given free to me. It was a product of my efforts. I worked sometimes until 11 00 p. M. And a lot of meeting were annoyed me. This experience give me self confidence. In addition I believe that people work for social network. That is people can extend their social network by working. This is because there are a wide range of people in company. For instance one of my best friends was a very shay person. She began photographer in Korea Magazine after graduated university. She associated a lot of people through the works. In conclusion I think most people work for their personal development because we can develop their dream. Not only that we also extend social network.
