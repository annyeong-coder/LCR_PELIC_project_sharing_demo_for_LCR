Without any doubt all governments are existed to provide thier citizins and the role of government is more importantly needed nowadays more than before. The gap way between rich and poor people is obviously noticed. Therefore I strongly stand side that govrnment should be responsible for providing the health care for everyone in the country because the health care is one of the basic thing for human being to be lived. First of all health care is a very basic need for people to live so that government should be responsible for that. Health care should be provided for the people regardless thier wealth social positions or success since health care is indispensable for people to sustain their lives. If the government does not provide health care to everyone in the country then people who can not afford themselves would be greatly harmed. For example in Africa a lot of basic necessities including health care are not fulfilled since government is being irresponsible for that. As a resulte many of young children are dying even because of flu which surely can be treated by simple form of medicine even you can find it in your pocket.
