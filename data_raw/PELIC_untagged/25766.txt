Title of Article The Power of Coincidence Author Jill Neinmark Source Well Read 4 book Vocabulary 1. Word Coincidence Part of speech Noun Definition A situation in which two things happen together by change in a suprising way. 2. Word Comet Part of speech Noun Definition An object in the sky like very bright ball with a tail that moves through space The first question coincidence brings to my mind is that is there an overall purpose to the universe or are we the luccky accidents of evolution. Thus both belivers and skeptics are fascinated by coincidence. Acording to skeptics coincidence is chance but however for belivers it is the purposeful occurance of two seemingly unrelated events. For example many years before people belived that comets are the messages of some kinds. Like in 44 B C E Romans recorded that a comet had appeared just before the Great Plaque and also Incan Indian had reported seeing a comet just before the arrival of Francisco Pizaro also some scientist have developed a machine that can make loud noice when a trouble is approching. Acording to all these examples it makes people hard to believe that coincidence is just a chance.
