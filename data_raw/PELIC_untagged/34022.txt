Dear Xavi I am glad to give you some advice. I think Pittsburgh is a really good choice for you because this city is selected to be the most livable city in the US. It is a middle size city where you can both enjoy lush and prosperous. One of your concerns is the weather I recommend you come here in spring term or summer term. Despite being hot in the summer there are many fantastic places to prevent sunstroke like falling water. If you want to participate in fall term you will meet the thanksgiving big sale. You don't need to worry about suffering cold winter because you can buy a lot of winter coats in very low price. Moreover buying clothes is tax free in this region what a good attraction! Otherwise Pittsburgh is a beautiful river city and you can have different view from the river cruise. If you haven't decided to come here don't hesitate Pittsburgh is a good place for you to study. Best Joyce
