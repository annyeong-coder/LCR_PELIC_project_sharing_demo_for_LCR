Life without someone cares and loves you with unconditional love are just like an empty world. I think the only person who has these specifications should be my mother. In another hand I think she has very grueling life as the same time she has a fabulous personality. My mother is medium height she is approximately 5 3' feet tall with a thin body. She has this healthy beautiful body because she cares of her nutrition and she doesn't eat too much. She has shiny short straight hair. It's dark brown. She has fair and soft skin with a mole above her lips. She wears glasses and she dressed very well in simple way at the same time. Her family moved to another country so she had to live away from her relatives. Her father died when she was 18 years old. After that she went to a college which she had to use 3 different means of transportations to reach her college. After her graduation she chose to delay her marriage and obtain a job to support her family for about 8 years. As a mother she was a great mother in the world and she still. I think she is the most unselfish person I've ever seen. She supports us from the first years in our lives and faces any difficult situations with her wisdom. Also she can hide her pain and come with a smiley and friendly face. She doesn't talk a lot. She uses dialogue and persuasion way instead of cruelty way in our upbringing. She is so patient. My mother whose has unconditional love makes her my hero. I wish one day be able to be like her especially when I have children.
