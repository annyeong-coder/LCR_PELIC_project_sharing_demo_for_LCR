In some countries teenagers have jobs while they are still students. Feeling and experience of teenager are important and will be remembered long time. So some parents want their children to get feel and experience for the future. For example some parents make their children to sell their stuffs that is not use more for getting feel what how much difficult make money. It is important to not only children but also teenagers. All of students can study same subjects on a book. We have to be specialist for surviving in the world. There is something that make student special from other people. I think experience is the most important factor that makes person be specialist. We can't study the experience on the book. We can't get feel in certain situation on the book. So how can students get experience The best way is through work. When we during working we will face with several situations and problems. Whenever we face with those cases we can't solve by just one way. But through working when we are student we can study how to treat diverse problems by correct way. And in my opinion someone who has many experience is better than someone who is just study.
