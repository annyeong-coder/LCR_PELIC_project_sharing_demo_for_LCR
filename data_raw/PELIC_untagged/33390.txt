I left my country 2 months ago. By the time I graduated from university I had decided to travel. I had never lived far from my family before I came to the US. I had always been dreaming to study abroad since I was in high school but I had never been thinking about the US. As soon as I had been accepted in the scholarship I chose the US. By 2011 I changed my opinion because I had been reading about Pittsburgh several years when I had been studying at the university.
