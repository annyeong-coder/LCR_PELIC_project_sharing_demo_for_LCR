My room is dark so I picked up a new sofa. Also I hung up a rack for my jackets. To make me feel better I cleaned my room up. Also I put up some nice landscapes. Moreover I picked out my old table. Also I turned around my bed to make more space. Also I brought a new bulb to light my room up. Furthermore I straighten my laptop up. Also I put my TV back. Now my room cheers me up.
