This proverb is written by an Englishman whose proverb defines one of the best friend's relationship. I think this means that friend is someone who can help me whenever I need help. I have many friends in Thailand which I came from. All of them would like to help me solve problem that I can't handle by myself. When I came to Pittsburgh I often contact them by email that is the cheapest method to keep in with them.
