To cover those needs they look for a job that provide at least the minimum satisfactions for them and that cover their daily life needs. For me I'm looking for a job that matches my study field and interests at the same time. So the three main jobs that I like to get are working in a business administration field teacher or interior designer. Business administration is a hug filed. It contains different majors such as finance marketing accounting etc. Each major is required in all kinds of companies and it is easy to get a job in this felid. It is my childhood dream to be a business woman that will be my first option to work . Being a teacher is one of my favorite jobs because it makes me feel that I'm a responsible person who provides knowledge to people. Teacher job has lots of benefits that make it desirable such as having long weekend as same as students less work than other jobs this is beside the lofty goal of the teacher job. When I was at home in Saudi Arabia I loved to put my own touch of decoration all over the house. I helped my mother a lot to decorate our house which increased my potential to be an interior designer. So if I have the choice I could choose to follow my talent and work as an interior designer. Wither I choose to work as a business woman teacher or interior designer I will defiantly satisfied because each of them has special meaning to me.
