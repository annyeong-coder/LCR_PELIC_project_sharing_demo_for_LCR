I will recharge my energy this weekend. First I will get sleep enough. Second I'll clean up my room. Third I will do some exercise for healthy. Fourth I'll get some fresh food like vegetable or fruits etc. At last I'll do my homework and study harder than another passed day. Also I'll go to church and meet some of friends. I'm very expecting my more active weekend.
