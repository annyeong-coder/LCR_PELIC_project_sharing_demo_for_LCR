Speaking natural English is a big challenge for a nonnative speaker. Sometimes it is difficult to describe what we want to say. A friend told me a story that her friend told her. An Asian man who was afraid to speak English had studied it for a long time. What sentence he always said was that he was fine thanked you. One day the man was crushed by a drunk driver. He lay on the road and his blood was flowing. A foreign people saw the accident he asked the Asian man if he needed some help. No surprise the Asian man answered that he was fine thanked you then he died. So if I always say that I am fine . What the means maybe is that I'm not really fine.
