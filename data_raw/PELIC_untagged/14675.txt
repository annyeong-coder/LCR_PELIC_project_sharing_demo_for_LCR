If I had listened to my parents I wouldn't have regreted a lot. When I was a middle school student I was a troblemaker. I was reluctant to do something that my parents asked me to do. At first if I had listenend that study hard I would have gotten good score on the univrsity enterance exam. Also if I had gotten good grades on exam I could have studied at good university. I used to hang out with friends a lot and skip the self studying classes. I wish I had studied hard. I wish I don't make that kind of mistake at all. Now my sister just came back from school and said why I didn't answer the phone then she wanted to ask me buying a coffee at starbucks. Oh I wish I'd picked the phone! Anyway if so I'd listened my parents.
