It was September 2003 when I met Nika my husband. I did not know him. He was speaking with my friend when I came to them. My friend introduced Nika to me. While we were studying together in the same class there was nothing strange in his behavior. One day when I entered the classroom everyone was congratulating him about something. As it turned out Nika had become a student at Cambridge University and he was going to continue his undergraduate studies there starting the next year. When I came to the University the next September Nika was sitting outside of my University. When I asked why he was there he answered that he came to see me. It would be more romantic if he had said that he changed his mind and he was not going to go in England because of me but the real end was much better than the romantic one. We graduated from our universities at the same time and soon we got married.
