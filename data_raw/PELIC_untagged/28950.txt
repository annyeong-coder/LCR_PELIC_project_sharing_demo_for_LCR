Hello Sand. Thank you for your letter. I understood you have serious dilemma. I'd like to give some advise to you. First Call him!! Conversation is quick remedy. You ought not to decide anything without talking with him. You don't have to distress yourself. You should call him and share your affection with him! I think your boyfriend is worrying about missing you too. We can talk face to face by Skype for free. If you love him don't be afraid! If I were you I would visit him soon even if he didn't mention about it. He may have felt sorry about having you come all the way to Minnesota. You should visit him as frequent as you can And I hope your boyfriend also make efforts to meet you. And you could make a decision after your struggle. I think you might not have compared your boyfriend with your job because you love both. I know 4 months might be short for you. You shouldn't decide to quit your job right now but you'd better do your best to go steady with him for a year or more. If you can strengthen your relationship in a year that's your boyfriend's win. Quit your job and move to his house! If you feel skeptic about your relationship because of distance that's your job's win. You can say to him that we're not lovers. . . Just good friends.
