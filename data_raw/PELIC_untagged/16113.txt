In my opinion practicing a sport for several hours a day is a good use of time for many reasons. One reason is that it is a vital way to keep you fit. For example if you used to swim that will make all your muscles moved. On the other hand you will refresh your lungs with oxygen every day. I recommend that everyone have to do at least the minimum of sport each day.
