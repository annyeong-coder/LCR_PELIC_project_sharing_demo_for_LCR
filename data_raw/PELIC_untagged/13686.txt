It's convenient for me to live in Hong ANON_NAME_0 Essay I had lived in both Tokyo and Hong ANON_NAME_0 for several years and I am living in the U. S now because I want to study English in the U. S. After studying English in the U. S I have to decide which of the two cities I will live in Tokyo or Hong ANON_NAME_0. I know there are several similarities and differences in both cities but I prefer to live in Hong ANON_NAME_0 rather than Tokyo. Firstly it seems clear that Tokyo and Hong ANON_NAME_0 have a lot in common. Both have a lot of schools as kindergartens elementary schools junior high schools high schools and universities. If you want to attend or let your children go you have many choices. Secondly public transportation is well developed and convenient in both Tokyo and Hong ANON_NAME_0. For example you can get on taxis buses trains subways from the airport to the city. Thirdly both have a lot of holidays such as New year holiday and Christmas holiday. You can use those holidays to travel. On the other hand there are some differences between Tokyo and Hong ANON_NAME_0. Firstly English is not spoken in Japan though Japanese people had learnt English in school. If you cannot speak in Japanese it is a crucial problem for you to live in Japan. Japan is one of the countries in which only the native language is spoken. However English Chinese and Cantonese are spoken in Hong ANON_NAME_0. In addition universities in Hong ANON_NAME_0 have various and very famous professors because English is spoken during their classes. Not only universities offer these languages but also kindergartens elementary schools and high schools do so. Secondly though there are many taxis buses trains and subways in Japan the ANON_NAME_1 are more expensive than those in Hong ANON_NAME_0. Taxis in Japan cost twice as much as that in Hong ANON_NAME_0 for the same distance. Moreover service hours of public transportation in Japan are shorter than these of Hong ANON_NAME_0. While it is from 5 00a. M to 1 00 a. M. In Japan it is from 5 00 a. M. To 3 00 a. M. In Hong ANON_NAME_0. Finally the most amazing thing is the system of calendar. It is different between Japan and Hong ANON_NAME_0. Hong ANON_NAME_0 has both the western calendar and the lunar calendar so people who are living in Hong ANON_NAME_0 have more holidays. For instance there are both the New Year holiday and the Chinese lunar New Year every year in Hong ANON_NAME_0. That is you can take New Year holidays twice a year. In conclusion after considering these similarities and differences between Japan and Hong ANON_NAME_0 I came to my decision to live in Hong ANON_NAME_0. It is because Hong ANON_NAME_0 has the possibility to learn more languages and to meet many teachers and professors who are from various countries. Hong ANON_NAME_0's transportation is also more convenient and cheaper and I can have more public holidays in Hong ANON_NAME_0 than in Japan. Therefore I would like to live in Hong ANON_NAME_0 in the future.
