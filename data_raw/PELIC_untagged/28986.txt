Kinds of customers A lot of people buy things every day these individuals are called customers. These customers are divided in 2 kinds slow and fast First the slow customers that normally love go shopping. They like to see everything and it takes a long time. With clothes for example this customers try to see if it fits on their bodies or if they like wearing it. They take a long time in each store and spend time seeing things that they don't need. The slow customers sometimes search for the best price in many stores to save some money. In the other hand customers who are fast don't like to go shopping and think this is painful. They go straight to the place that they want. With this they don't see everything in the store and can miss sales and good things but it save some precious time for them. The fast customers have to be fast because sometimes they have a lot of work to do or kids to take care. In other words they don't have too much flexibility of time. The fast customers are usually more compulsive buying things because they try to buy as faster as they can. It results in buy things not so useful. To conclude all the types of customers have good and bad things that make them different from each other. The slow take longer to finish their shopping but they buy the best thing that they find. The fast ones go shopping fast but they buy things that maybe would not be the best quality or price.
