How I met my friend I met my friend ANON_NAME_0 when I moved to Moscow. I was studying in the first year of the university when we had a student trip to another city. My classmate Sasha invited his sister ANON_NAME_0 to travel with us. Our trip was one week. During that week we were living together me Sasha and ANON_NAME_0 in the same room. After that trip I got sick. While I was staying at home ANON_NAME_0 was taking care about me. She cooked my lovely cakes and went with me to see my doctor. At that time our friendship started.
