In the past if someone entered the university someone used to enjoy the university life in Korea. For example he usually drunk the beer and tried to meet girl friend. So he didn't study. But now students of university have changed many students have been studying so hard and looking for the job. That's good change I think. Also many students have been enjoying the life too. No more than it just become weak. Now university students' ability is better than before.
