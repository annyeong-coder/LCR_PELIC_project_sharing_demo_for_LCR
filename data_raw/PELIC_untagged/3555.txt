These days there is nobody who does not has a laptop or PC in addition if s he does not has one s he can not do without Computers. Moreover if you plan to buy a computer you want to buy something efficient and updated. Usually friends of mine ask me to have my advice about what is the best computer in the market right now because they know that I have experience with computers. Thus in this easy I will compare and contrast Acer Aspire and HP Pavilion notebooks. Acer Aspire and HP Pavilion are similar in some features. Both of them have 15. 4 WXGA TFT LCD display with Crystal rite technology and 1280 x 800 resolutions. Furthermore both of them have processor brand Intel u Pavilion has 3 years warranty for parts and labor conversely Acer Aspire has only one year warranty for parts and 3 years warranty for labor. As a result those differences are not important because there are no big differences. In conclusion it would seem that HP pavilion is better and have more features than Acer Aspire. After these comparisons and contrasting if I wanted to buy either Acer Aspire or HP Pavilion I will go with HP Pavilion because I like this company and usually they take care of their customers also I have HP notebook since 2000 and it works well and very efficient.
