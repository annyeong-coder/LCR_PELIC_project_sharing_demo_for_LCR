Once I was waiting at the bus station. After waiting for a bus I rode it with my friend. Then at another station there was an old woman who was using a walker which is controlled by the hands. That woman wanted to ride the bus so I moved from my chair to leave it for her. While waiting for the woman to get in the bus every one was looking toward the door. In fact every body saw the woman started to walk by her walker after the driver facilitated that for her. However the woman didn't get in. We stopped seeing her. The driver stood up and said don't touch and he made a call. People at the station were crowded at the front of the bus many people from the bus also did. My friend and I had no idea about what happened outside the bus until the driver asked us and a few people to take another bus. When we get off the bus we saw the old woman lying on the floor and the blood was coming from under her head. Being stuck by the door she felt down. Unless the driver said don't touch someone would tried to help her to stand. Surprised by the woman's condition I started to cry. Seeing what happened at the morning I couldn't sleep that night.
