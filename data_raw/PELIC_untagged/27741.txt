I live in a small apartment at Mountain Lebanon. Before I entire my apartment I take off my shoes. Sometime my apartment let me down because he is so messy. I should throw him away but I like him because he is my best friend. My apartment's door so confusing you can not go back when you do not have the key. There are two bed rooms and one and half bathroom. I wish to make up my room because it is so messy. Also I want to buy a hanger to put my coat on it. I have a modern TV but I can not figure it out. I want to buy small radio because it make me happy when I want to sleep.
