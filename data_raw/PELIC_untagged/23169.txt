The most important aspects in the education are choosing the teacher. The school should exhibit the rules for teacher to follow that in their teaching styles. It is crucial for the teachers to concern about the prominent styles in their teaching such as personalities ways of teaching and how to clarify the subject they teach. One of my teachers in was teaching mathematics class while the other one has teached history class. The differences between both of them are obviously particularly in the personality and the way of clarifying the information. Teacher who is name is ANON_NAME_0 was tough and has a high personality. On the other hand Teacher who has called Joker and his name is ANON_NAME_1 was flexible and humble. In addition ANON_NAME_0 had a specific style in teaching such as postpone all the students' question until the end of the class. However ANON_NAME_1 whose teaching style I like is accept the question during his explanation. Also ANON_NAME_0 used to use his classic teaching and wrote in the board. Further more ANON_NAME_0 was not like to use the technology in his teaching in contrast to ANON_NAME_1 who fostered us to use the computer in printing our homework used the technology in his teaching such as power point and projects. ANON_NAME_1 encouraged the student and enhanced the activities. However ANON_NAME_0 did not like that and was not cooperative with the student. Ultimately the teaching styles between ANON_NAME_1 and ANON_NAME_0 is noticeable such as the ambiguity of ANON_NAME_0 in Clarified the knowledge while ANON_NAME_1 who was optimistic is has had a perfect style. Consequently both of them did not parallel to other in their teaching style
