Dear Sand I've received your letter and I'm sorry to know that. First of all I think you don't have to let him know what's your feeling. . . Yet. But I think as soon as you know that he loves you you should tell him that you have the same emotion. Listen you don't have to visit him for these 3 years. Also in my opinion you don't have to talk to him everyday or by time to time once is enough. If he doesn't tell you that he loves you within a month you must break up this relationship. You must focus in what you are working in. Your job is very great so you shouldn't skip it. By the way you should have mentiond him that you love him before he went out just to know if he does or not! Being without a boyfriend is something very very beautiful. You don't have to be aware for anything. You can do whatever you like whenever you like however you like wherever you like.
