This story is about an appointment which made by two good friends twenty years ago. One of them named Bob another one is Jimmy Wells. They were good friends and both grew up together in New York. They were separated because they need to make their own fortune and start their own destiny but they made an appointment and promised each other they will meet again at the same time same place after twenty years. In that night Bob waited in the place where they should meet. Then there was a policeman came to talk with him the policeman asked the story between Bob and Jimmy after a short chatting the policeman left. Bob still waited and he believed his friend must be there if Jimmy still alive in this world. Hopefully another man who worn the long overcoat came here and asked him if he is Bob. They were excited to see each other again after twenty years but when they walked to somewhere which has light Bob indicated that the man was not Jimmy Wells. At the same time the overcoat man caught him suddenly and told him that he was the man who was needed by Chicago police. After this the overcoat man gave Bob a piece of paper which was given by the person who appeared here first. It said that Jimmy Wells arrived in the place where they made an appointment on time but when Bob lighted his cigar he saw his face clearly Bob is the person who wanted in Chicago. But Jimmy Wells couldn't do that by himself so he called another man to do this job. Anyway after twenty years there is a huge difference between the two old friends. One of them became a criminal but another person became a policeman.
