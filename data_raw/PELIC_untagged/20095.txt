I have a nice bedroom. Before I moved in there were only a bed a desk and a book shelf. Then I bought a mirror and leaned it against the wall. I picked out a nice picture from a painting store and hung it up. I put a blue coverlet on my bed and I straightened all of my books up on the book shelf. I like that my bedroom looks like warm and light so I always turn all the lampes on. Now I feel comfortable in my bedroom.
