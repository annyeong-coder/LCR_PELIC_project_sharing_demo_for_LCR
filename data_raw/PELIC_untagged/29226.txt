I think sports are valuable because they provide entertainment. In my case I have played Frisbee few times with my American friends where we can see a good view of Pittsburgh. Since I had never played Frisbee in Japan I was afraid of playing that at the first time. However after they told me how to play Frisbee carefully I acquired Frisbee and my ability of Frisbee increased. As I understood how to play Frisbee we enjoyed Frisbee golf that individual players throw a disc into a basket. It was really interesting for me although I lose a lot. Furthermore the process of both learning and playing Frisbee with them was pleasant for me. Even though I couldn't speak English very well we could spend an amusement time and also could get to know each other. From my perspective sports are not only healthy but also entertaining us. Whenever we play sports there is no national borders.
