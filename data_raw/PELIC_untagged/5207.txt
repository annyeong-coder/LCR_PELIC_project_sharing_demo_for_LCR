I think it is reasonable to me because I chose a person who has good smell for me. For example I feel secure when I smell at my mother's odor so I was carrying the blanket which had her odor until graduating from middle school. And I think it might influence to choose a mate. Sometimes people feel comfort when they smell at odor they like and it is up to their favor. Therefore if they meet someone who has odor which makes them comfortable and secure they can share their life more easily. So it can influence their choice of choosing mates.
