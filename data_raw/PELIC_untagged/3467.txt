This is a interesting topic . I think this is a big controversy . I think some of students prefer study at home the reason may be vary but I think the biggest reason may be they don't want to came to school . Study at a traditional school can have a lot of fun you will get a lot of friends and know a lot of things from your classmates but if you tried come to school every morning it's hard for you wake up so early you can choose study on internet or study from TV . In the future if we can study on TV . I think professor will agree us study at home basic on some condition . For example you must study at home more than 3 hours one day you have to finish every day's work and you should come to school one time each week may be there is disagree between student and professor . And you ought to take a test on line . Overall this is my imagine about future school
