Hello Corol. I'm so sorry. I didn't know this homework. Please receive my homework. When I was young my parents make me learn lots of things. When I was 4 years old my mother let me learn drawing picture. Because I liked drawing a picture I often drew a picture on the wall. So she was upset almost everyday. And she wanted to make me know how to play piano. So I should take piano lesson everyday. I had learned playing piano for 8years. But I am not good at playing piano. My father made me eat faster. When I was young he called me turtle. They helped me to be adult.
