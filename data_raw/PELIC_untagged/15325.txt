Food is essential for human everyday life. Diversity of food is substantial and we are responsible for what we eat. People usually choose their food based on personal preferences health and religious reasons. Being in a different country I had noticed similarities and differences between my country's eating habits Saudi Arabia and the country I am studying in which is United States of America USA . To begin with Globalization has made the world a smaller place and when it comes to food Saudi Arabia and USA have a lot in common. First of all both countries have famous chain resturants such as Subway Macdonalds Burger King and Fuddruckers. The cost is also exactly the same at both countries. Moreover both countries do not offer dogs meet. Most importantly both countries have three meals per day breakfast lunch and dinner. On the other hand there is a minor differences between the two countries. First in Saudi Arabia if we eat meat the animal must be slaughtered according to Islamic rules which is not common in USA. In addtion comparing both types of foods we notice another difference. Since muslims are the majorty in Saudi resturnats there don't offer pork. The most notable difference between these two countries is how to eat the food. In Saudi Arabia people use bare hands to eat while in the USA people use spoons and forks to eat. In conclusion differences are so little. Having all the famous chain restaurants that I'm used to back home made my life easier while studying in the states.
