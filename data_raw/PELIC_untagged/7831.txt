Welcome! I'm Coco. I build this website to record my life here. I've written this page to introduce myself. I grew up in Shanghai China. I've been living in the U. S. Since 2003. I've always been a working hard studying hard kind of girl. I've been studying in the ELI for a couple of months but I still take time out to play. Since I moved to U. S I've tried a lot of hiking. In fact last month I saw a fox and he followed us for one hour. Here is a picture to show you how the fox looks like. I've included more pictures of this history hiking.
