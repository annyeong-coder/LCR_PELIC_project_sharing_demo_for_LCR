I was born in Bucaramanga Colombia. Before I traveled to the US I was working at Santo Tomas University San Buenaventura University Rosario University in Bogota. Now I am studying English as a second language at Pitt. I didn't study English in my country. English is a new experience and learning in my life. The most interesting experience in my study about English is that now I can read books in English about philosophy. In my free time I am reading a book about Marcus Aurelius The Inner Citadel. I am fascinated to read this book because the Hadot's interpretation the author of the book remarks that the emperor's philosophy had like goal created rules of his own life . I am taking notes about the passages in which Marcus Aurelius exemplifies the personal rules that he applies to himself. I am enyoying this reading very much. I usually read books about philosophy but especially this book captivates me. I think that the most valuable contibution of Hadot's book is the idea about an inner writing that sought to build a wall around the soul for liberate it of the vain desire.
