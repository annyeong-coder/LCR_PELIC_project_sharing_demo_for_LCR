My apartment is clean and comfortable. The room cheers me up when I go back form school. Clean makes me feel good because I and my roommates always clean the room on sunday. We like throw away the trash everyday. Noise makes me feel bad because our room is on the bottom of the apartment. Sometimes people make up noise when they are walking. Now I need to turn on the light everytime. So I want to sun can direct light up my room. I want to add some windows in my room. I hope it become more comfortable.
