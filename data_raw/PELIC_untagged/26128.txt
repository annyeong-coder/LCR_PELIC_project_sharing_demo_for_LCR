I think the most important thing is a tent because we don't know how the weather will be so we have got to take a tent. Also matches can be helpful for starting a fire and cooking. We shouldn't forget to take a knife with us two or three knives may be better we have to be aware of animals because desert is a area which includes different kinds of animal. In addition flashlights must take a place in our bags the desert might be scary at night.
