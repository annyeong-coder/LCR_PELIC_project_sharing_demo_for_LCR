Saving endangered animals is the most important thing we need to do. The first thing to protect the endangered animals is to reduce environment pollution. The animals don't have enough food and habitats by deforestation and oil spill etc. Widespread deforestation damaged the habitats of the animals. Oil spill caused the deaths of many animals especially the polar bears and the penguins. It should be made laws to limit the amount of deforestation and should be avoided the accident of oil spill. The second factor caused endangered animals have massively diminished that is the unrestrained slaughter of wild animals. People who want to have tortoiseshell ivories corals and high rated furs. They use illegal trade to get the products that make more and more animals are killed. Making laws enacted to prevent the importation of rare animals and the products made from their skin and bones. There laws must be strictly enforced. Also the public must be cared about the animals which we will lose. If we don't care this issue the next endangered species maybe is human.
