In my opinion there is no difference of language between human and nonhuman primates. For example Koko can use sign language very well. It can show its feeling appropriately even though it can not make a complete sentence. Sometimes the staff just say in English without sign language Koko can still understand and response them. If it finds some words it hasn't learned before it can create a special word or sign. Although some people think that apes or chimpanzees are just imitative I believe that nonhuman primates can understand how to use language.
