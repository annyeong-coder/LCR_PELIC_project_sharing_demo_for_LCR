A I have to bring my make up set. B No you shouldnt. You should bring something important to your life. A If I cant do my make up my face will change. You will be surprised. B Fine. You can bring that. Should we bring several pairs of underwear I dont want to wear the same underwear for a while. A You dont have to worry about that. This is a TV show so the designer must prepare clothes and underwear for you. The name is reality show but not real. It is different from going to an island alone. If it is real you could die. B Can I take matches A Yeah. That works.
