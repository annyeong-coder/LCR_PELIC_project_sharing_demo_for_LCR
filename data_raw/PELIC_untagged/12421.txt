We get a lot of stress unless we live in a big city. Even though people who live in a small city they get too much stress. So we want to something entertainment. I think sports provide entertainment more than other things. First when we had a game many people watched TV or WE went to a sports stadium. Because while our team played the game they made exciting to us. Second we can talk with friend or our family while we watched sports. We can have enjoy the pleasures of family or friends togetherness with the game. Conclusion sports provide entertainment to us. If our team win the game we will very exciting. Even if they lose their game we won't be disappointed. For these reasons I think sports always provide entertainment to us.
