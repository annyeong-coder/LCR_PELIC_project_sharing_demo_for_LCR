In the age of computers finding a book in a library has become very easy. First find the computers that contain the library's catalogs. There are two catalogs one for books and one for periodicals magazines newspapers and so on . In the book catalog type the topic you are seeking information about in the space labeled Subject then scroll through the entries from the books that are displayed on the computer screen and determine which ones seem the most relevant. After that write down the title and call number of each book that you want. Then locate the books on the library shelves by their call numbers. Before you take the books to the checkout desk be prepared to show your library card at the checkout desk.
