I'd like to change my room's style. First I want to turn my bed around. It makes me fresh. I turn curtains over and I put the vase on the table. It also makes room bright and vivid. I hang up the picture on the wall because it makes me comfortable. In addition I hang up the mirror on the wall because it is helpful for making up. When I go to the market I pick out the new desk instead of putting the old one away. If I clean the chairs up it looks more spacious. When I go back to my room everyday small changes cheer me up.
