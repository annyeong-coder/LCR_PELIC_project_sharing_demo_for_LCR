Frank Writing 4 June 19 2008 Through our research it is evident that high blood pressure is one of the major reasons which increase someone's risk of heart disease. High pressure causes a heart to work in overloading status. When this sort of situation lasts long time or happens frequently it would damage arteries and eventually result in heart disease. However having a type A personality has a minor effect on heart disease through our investigation. A person who owns the type A personality always feels stressed sometimes looks overly competitive acts aggressive and treats everything intensely. This sort of character would lead to negative effect on his blood pressure. But considering those scenes are mostly temporary events this factor has a tiny impact on heart disease.
