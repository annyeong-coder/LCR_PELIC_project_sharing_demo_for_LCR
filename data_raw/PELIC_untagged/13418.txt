I used to live in my country. I went to high school. In those days I didn't use to go school alone because always my parents carried me and pick me up. At home I used to watch did my home work and going to bed earlier. I didn't use to wear skirt because I didn't love them at that time. I used to working too late I got used to thinking that cartoon movies wasn't important to me anymore. I used to be single. Today I am normal person and I use to take care of my self of my husband and of my future baby. I use to go shopping and buy wherever I love I don't use to dance because I think that I am too lazy. I use to brad my own hair because I don't have who brad me. I use to cook every week but in weekend my husband takes out to eat.
