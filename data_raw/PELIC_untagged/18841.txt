After this semester I will be still in Pittsburgh because I am going to study here next semester too. I have just rented an apartment and I need to work on it. I am going to buy some furniture. I am also planing to review the things we learned in this semester. After I finished the classes in ELI I am planing to get my master degree. Thus it seems for a while studying is not going to end.
