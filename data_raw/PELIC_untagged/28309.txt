I grew up in Seoul which is capital of South Korea. Seoul is the place which is located on the Han river in the center of the Korea peninsula. Seoul is the largest city in South Korea and Seoul is the place where too many people live. So driving a car in Seoul is difficult. But Seoul is educational and economic center of South Korea and Seoul is the place where you can see beautiful night views and many things of South Korea.
