My apartment is cold in winter. So we tried to keep our room warm. We took thin curtains down and changed to blanket. In winter I hate my apartment. It has heater that doesn't work enough and other apartments block out our light. I like my apartment for only one reason. It is big. Sometimes we held a birthday party for our friends. We straighten up our apartment and through trash away. We also put some pictures up to decorate our apartment. We always use our apartment for party. Now I'm looking new apartment up on the Internet. Next time I want to live in nice apartment which has no problems.
