Five years ago I met with my husband in a company where I worked. My husband who had already gotten his job in the US was going to work the company temporarily until he would renew his Visa to work in the US. Initially I didn't have any special feeling for him. He seemed unique to me because he had worked in Germany and the US and told me interesting stories which he experienced there so I was attracted by him little by little. After he got his renewed Visa he left the company for the job in the US. I kept working there in Japan but I kept in touch with him by e mail and phone call. When he visited in Japan during Christmas vacation we went out for dating. After our relationship became serious I didn't tell the story to my colleagues whom my husband and I worked with. I just wanted to go out with him secretly because I felt a little shy to talk about him to the colleagues who knew my husband well as a previous coworker. After I had gone out with him for 2 years distantly I decided to quit my job and to come Pittsburgh where my husband was working. I told my supervisor I would quit job still I didn't talk about my relationship with my husband. After we got married we visited the company to let my colleagues know our marriage. They were really surprised to hear that and congratulated our marriage. My supervisor who had experienced living in the US told me that it would be a very precious experience for me to stay in the US where we can see many people from various countries. Besides they planed quickly a party for us in a nice restaurant which was located near the company. I was really moved to with their kindness and I will never forget the day when we had the wonderful party.
