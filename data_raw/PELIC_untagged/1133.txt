The best meal experience I have ever had was about one year ago it was my birthday. I went with my parents to the most famous Japanese restaurant of Caracas. When we went there we coul see a beautiful decoration with many Japanese chairs and tables. First We ordered three cups of white wine and then we ordered three differents kind of sushi and sashimi when the waitress brought the sushi and sahimi they were in a small wooden boat. Finally when we finished we ordered three fried ice crean and three cups of cappucino. I think that it was my best meal experience because I ate a wonderful Japanese food and I could had a great time with my parents.
