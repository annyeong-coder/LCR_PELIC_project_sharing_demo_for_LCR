CSI Grissom and Catherine investigated a man's head that was found in the trunk of a vehicle. The vehicle was stolen by two young girls. Although these girls stole the vehicle by accident they didn't know anything about the head. Because they just did it in order to run away from a weird guy whom they met in a bar. Grissom and Catherine found one picture that was torn half away in the dead person Dasilva's house. With the picture he could found one man who was used to be an intimate friend with Dasilva. Because they could see earrings in the edge of the picture and a manager of the restaurant which Nick took them could recognize whose earrings were. By checking the footprints of the suspect whose name was Applewhite they were able to have a confidence that he must have been a murderer.
