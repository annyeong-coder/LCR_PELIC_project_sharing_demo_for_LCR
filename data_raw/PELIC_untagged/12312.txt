I agree with the author's opinion. When Kids enter the elementary school they anticipate that they do a lot of interesting activities which they have never experienced. The school is a new and surprising place that they try to get involved in their work. However as time passes they get used to the environment and realized that activities aren't interesting anymore. In first and second grade teachers try to teach more passionately to motivate children to study. Yet in third and fourth grade teachers pay attention to their study and skills needing in society more than building their creativity.
