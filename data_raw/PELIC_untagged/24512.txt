My story with English will not finish! When I was in my country I did not have eligibility to speak English with someone else but I had some English words or expressions that can be told when I order in a restaurant or somewhere else. For instance we usually say when we order at the restaurant Could you please give me. . . Etc . Honestly I had a simple use of English. So that I got an opportunity in the US to study English in order to acquire the dominant language of the world that will enable me to speak with anyone in worldwide easily. My language improved because of the ELI English Language institute I could communicate with my friends who are non native speakers but when I spoke with American speakers they did not understand me distinctly even thought my friend who was from China understood me perfectly. That might be because of the using of appropriate words. I realized that American speakers used specific expression when they talk. On the other hand foreign students use complicated words to express about something which does not make sense to American speaker.
