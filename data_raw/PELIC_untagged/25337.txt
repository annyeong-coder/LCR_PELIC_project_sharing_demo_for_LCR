Spring festival The spring festival is one of the most significant festivals in China. People celebrate the festival to welcome the new year. The festival lasts for a week during which people convey their best wishes to their friends and families. At the same time they hope that they may have good luck in the coming new year. As a result under no circumstances do people want to spend the festival without their families. The most important thing in the festival is the reunion dinner. On the last day of the year every family prepares a bumper meal for dinner. All the family members gather together to have this rich dinner which is the last dinner in the year. After that all the family members wait for the new year together. When the first tinkle of bells is ringing in the new year every family is revelled in the happiness. The second thing people must do is setting off the firecrakers and fireworks. The activity takes place in the evening of the 4th day of the Chinese new year. The reason why people do this activity is that in Chinese traditional culture setting off the firecrakers and fireworks can lead the god of wealth come to their home. That means their road to wealth will be wide open in the following new year. Last but not least a red packet is given to the children during the spring festival. The seniors in the family put some money in a red packet and give it to the children as a present. People use this way to tell their children that they are one year order now and they shoud be more sensible intelligent and courageous. The moment when children get their red packets is really a wonderful memories for every children. To conclude what I have mentioned above the spring festival is a festival when all the families gather together and celebrate the Chinese new year. Futhermore it is a gorgeours festival which contains all kinds of happiness and beautiful memories. It is deep rooted in the heart of every Chinese. I love spring festival.
