Do you have to find people who have the same personality to be friend with I don't think so. My friend ANON_NAME_0 and I are best friends who complete each other. He's a capable man who can do many things. We are not people that have the same personality but we are best friends. ANON_NAME_0 who I trust lives in KSA. So if you are trying to find people that have the same things in common with each other you will be along.
