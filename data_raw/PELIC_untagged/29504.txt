Since some environmental associations informed people about global warming soil pollution and many endangered species the authorities of France took some restrictive measures. The most important concerns garbage. First of all French government has invested for building modern recycling factories. Those factories eliminate waste without polluting air. Second some materials and products are now restricted. For instance use plastic bag was forbidden two years ago. Stores give no plastic bag to their customers because plastic bags pollute too much the environment and are difficult to recycle. Third French people are encouraged to sort their garbage. Every residence or house has three different trashes. In addition we can find easily trashes for ink bulb and battery. Finally if we want throw out a piece of equipment or an article of furniture we can bring it to the store where we bought it and in exchange we have cash or a reduction for our future purchases.
