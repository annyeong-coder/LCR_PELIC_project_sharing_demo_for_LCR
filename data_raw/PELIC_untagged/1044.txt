In Brazil we have many subcultures I have experience with some that subcultures but I want to explain just about my region because we have a stranger customs. I live in Northwest from Brazil and we have for example typical foods from corner different style music and different Portuguese accent. In my region we have nine states and all the states have typical foods music and Portuguese accent. I think that our music is very specific we like other style music from Brazil but our song is very different is like salsa but more fast. In our region we have typical parties too that we don't have in whole cauntry
