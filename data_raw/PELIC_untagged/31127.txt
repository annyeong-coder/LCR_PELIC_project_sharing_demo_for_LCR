One of the most surprising events in my life is that my husband who was then boyfriend got an admission from CMU. The event was surprising to me in many aspects. When I first heard the news I was happy with what he achieved since I knew how strongly he wanted to go to PhD program in the US. However I became worried about our relationship simultaneously as I knew that we need to be apart for years. At the time it had been only 1 year since I had started my career and I wanted to continue the career in Korea. Even though I knew he had been preparing to study abroad how I felt about our future and recognized impending separation was totally different at the news. I can say that the time was when I had to deal with conflict in my emotions. In specific I was supposed to congratulate and support my husband's admission but the fact that we should be apart made me sad. In addition it was one of a few moments that I experienced emotional turmoil from the thought that my career plan may be changed due to other people not myself. Before then my plan doesn't usually depend on whether someone will be with me with the plan. Anyway I married him and moved to Pittsburgh as you know.
