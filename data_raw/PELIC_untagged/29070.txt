Living in Europe I like playing and watching soccer. Since I was ten years old I had played in the team of a town called Bonvillars. Playing for fun we were not very good but had always a good time together. However others teams not always shared our happiness. Indeed even playing also in the regional league they believed that we were in the World Cup. Loosing a game some players insulted the referee and us constantly or tried to fight at the end of the game which is a bit pathetic in view of the fact that those players weren't good at all. Soccer has become violent not only in regional league but also in professional leagues. However at that level it is not the players who fight but the fans. Thinking that they defend their city some fans go to the stadium only to do battle with other fans. Very well organized or having connections in the police they are able to avoid police controls and to go into the stadium. Thus being a global problem violence in sports should be eliminated. However being afraid to become unpopular politicians don't dare to struggle with the problem.
