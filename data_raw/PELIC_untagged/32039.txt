If I were able to travel to any country I would go to an island countries in Pacific Ocean. I really like sunshine and hot sun because they make me more enthusiastic. At beaches on the island I would like to take a rest under the shed of trees and I would like to enjoy blue colored ocean with sitting on a beach chair. It is better for me if I go with my family.
