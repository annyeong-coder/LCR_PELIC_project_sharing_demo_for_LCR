Business Management and Engineering are the most popluar fields of foreign students we can get these informations by the pie chart. It has 19. 4 Percents foreign students are studying Business Management and 15. 2 Percents are studying Engineering. This mean that almost 35 percent of all foreign students are studying either Business and Management or Engineering It is over 1 3 percentage of all students. Finally in my opinion the schools need have complete business English class and egineering English class before these foreign students enter their program. By these numbers we can understand these two fields that are most popluar fields of foreign students.
