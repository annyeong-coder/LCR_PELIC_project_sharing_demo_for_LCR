I was born in Seoul which is the capital city of Korea and I grew up in a town that is famous as the place of traditional Korean urban houses. I also lived in that house which has made by wood. The town was always crowded with tourists who came from various countries. In a front garden it has located a big tree which my grandfather planted. When I was a child I spent a lot of time under the tree.
