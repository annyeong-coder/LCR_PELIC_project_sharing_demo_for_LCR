When I was working in a hospital I saw a patient had problem in his brain. He could not move his arms or legs. Sometimes he could not speak clearly but he can understand what we need from him. This case was first time to see like it. One day he asked me to talk with his parents. He want to continue his education. He told me I can understand and speak clearly most time . He was even able to move one hand. Also he was able to change himself to be better. He could write very well by right hand. Finally one school accept him to continue his education by online.
