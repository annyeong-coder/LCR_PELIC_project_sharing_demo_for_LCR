I traveled to Dubai last summer. When I was there I was interesting to try their traditional cuisine. I asked some people about the most famous dish in UAE and they told me it is called Mohammra. The main components are 3 kilos of boneless chicken and 4 slides of eggplant. Also you have to have one spoon of salt a grain of rice a cup of fresh milk and spices. Begin with boiling tow liters of water with the chicken and the eggplant slides. Then add your spices and the salt. After that cook the rice with the milk. This dish was delicious I gave my mother a piece of advice to learn how to cook it.
