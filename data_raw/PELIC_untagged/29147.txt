I think that sports are valuable because they provide entertainment. I watched TV a lot when the Olympics or the World cups were on. Recently I enjoy watching football and ice hockey games. Before I lived in Pittsburgh I was not a football or ice hockey fan. Anywhere I go I can meet the people who wear a uniform of the Penguin or the Steelers team in Pittsburgh. About one month ago my husband and I went the Penguin's play. At first we were not sure whether we could go or not. Because my husband had a lot of homework we were hesitated to go there. Since we already got ticket we decided to go. There were a lot of people. We ate some food before they start a game. Fortunately the Penguin won the game. Because we worried about traffic we went home when the game was almost over. It was so much fun. Even though my husband had a lot of homework to do we were happy. He told me that he could forget about stressful stuffs for a while. If we can get a chance to go there we'll go to the game.
