The school library is very rich and varietal place for students. When you walk in the entrance door the first thing you notice is that there are a lot of tables in the middle of the library. There are computers above these tables and a plant beside one of them. On the right side you will see the BOOK CD DVD CHECK OUT desk. On the wall there is a portrait of the nature between the CHECK OUT desk and the entrance door. Also there is a clock on top of the door. Next to the CHECK OUT desk there is a large paper recycle basket. On your left hand you will find the book cases with the most subjects.
