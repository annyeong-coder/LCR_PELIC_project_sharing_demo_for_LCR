Pittsburgh is one of the most cities has many universities for that a lot of students studying and they should stay for long time in regular apartments. Every student has a different way to find an apartment like looking by location rent or how many rooms. The time is important for student because they have a lot of things to do everyday. Wherefore student will save time when they locate close to them school and they will live near to all facilities in the university. Live close to the university is good but usually expansive. The transportation in Pittsburgh is one of great things. Thence every locations in Pittsburgh are nice to rent because you can move from any distention to another by using public transportations. Some universities give free buses tickets for student university of Pittsburgh is one of them. Living alone is the best way for some people to organized them self. However some people like to share with roommate in the same apartment and organized schedule for all home work like cleaning and cocking. For me living alone is better than live with roommate.

In general renting place to live it will be the first step for any one had moved to new a city as I did when I came to Pittsburgh.
