I think food is different from regions. If you were living in Western country you can eat more bread than Eastern country. As your residence you might have changed your food style. I used to eat rice with soup when I lived in Seoul but now I have changed my food habit like eating instant food since I have accommodated myself to Pittsburgh. It is more convenient to have meal here. Now I am going to contrast food in Seoul with that in Pittsburgh. My goal is that how different they are such as main ingredients recipes and eating manner.
