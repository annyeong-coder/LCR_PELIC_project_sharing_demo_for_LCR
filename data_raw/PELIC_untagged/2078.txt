Are there different cultural expectations of success for males and females I think there are several different expectations of success for males and females in my country. First of all when we were children take falling down as an example if you were a boy and when you fall down and cry your parents will say don't cry your are a boy get up by yourself. In contrast if you are a girl the parents will comfort you and help you get up. Therefore the parents expect boys should be brave and strong but for girls these two characters are not necessary. Second for males it's important to have a good job and a high salary if men don't have job people will say they don't have great ability. On the other hand for females it's good to have a job but high salary is not necessary moreover if they don't have job it's okay. Thus people expect men should have job because it represents how great their ability are but for women it's not because their ability maybe show in another way such as taking care of their children and family very well seem more important than having a good job. Finally taking drive as an example for men people expect they should drive very well because it seems natural if you were a man you probably could drive very well. If you were a woman and you drive very well people will feel surprised and applaud you. For example in my experience when I sit in a car and the driver is a man when the driver see a car moved very slowly he always say the driver must be a women. For this reason people have different expectation for males and females about driving a car. The different expectation for males and females above is just a common situation but not necessary. Especially now people change their thinking about fairness of men and women for instance if men can do their job very well the women must can do it as well as the men.
