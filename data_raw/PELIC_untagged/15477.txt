Stress at work or school In my opinion I think that I will do my best to handle anything. Althuogh I can't do it to reach standard I have do it . In addition when you have any trouble you can give youself some confidence and tell youself I can do it . Finally I think that No pain No giin but don't give youself too much stress because stress is also the reason of failing . When you finish something you need some recreations such as watching movies shopping . . . And so on . Every day tell youself tomorrow is also beautiful day before sleeping.
