Bout everything. I think that reading has helped me to understand the world better especially when I read about the different cultures. I like writing too. Of course the more I read the more I become a better writer. One day I will write a book and I hope that it will be a good book. These are my interests that I try to do from once to a while. There is nothing wrong of working hard and enjoying your life at the same time.
