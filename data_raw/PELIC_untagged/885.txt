CLASS Writing Level 3 G Activity 3 30 Second draft Oct 16 2006 Dear Falah I recently went to see the Laptop that you asked me about it. I saw different Laptops from different companies. The best of them were two Laptops. One of them was from Sony Company and another one was from Toshiba Company. Both have good options but I prefer Sony more than Toshiba. Sony's Laptop has more Internet speed than the Toshiba. Also Sony's Laptop memory is more than it is in Toshiba Laptop. In addition I liked Sony's Laptop color it was wonderful. Finally Toshiba's Laptop is heavier than the Sony's Laptop and you're freeman to choose which one that you wont me to buy it for you. Sincerely
