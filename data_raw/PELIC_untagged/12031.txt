My name is ANON_NAME_0 I come from libya my major is internal medicine my interests are watching TV and serving internet. I am single and right now I am cocking washing and cleaning by my self. In 2000 I started my medical collage study I was very happy at that time but in the same time it was very difficult because my english language was not so perfect. But gradually it started to improve. I was studing hard to achieve my goals. By the time I fineshed my first year medical study my english language had improved too much and since that time I have become comfortable with my study and my tongue have started to speak more fluently. I was so happy with my progress. I have graguated from 7th October university school of medicine with gerneral grade very good. When I fineshed my medical study I joind Tripoli Medical Center TMC for clinical training. When our government decided to award me scholership I had been working for two years in T. M. C.
