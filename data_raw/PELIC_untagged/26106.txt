First A. C. L. U is challenging FBI's no flight list which is a list of people that seem potentially terrorists. FBI made this list to prevent crimes. The problem of this list is people who is listed in the list can't know that they are in the list before boarding the airplane. Also they can't know why they are in the list. So A. C. L. U is fighting for the right to know. Second news is people in Turkey can't access google and youtube. Because of that businesses which is relevant to google and youtube get financial damages. Government of Turkey is blocking these sites to preserve their culture. There are too many information of Turkey on the internet and the government thinks that those informations are ruining their culture. However the government said if google and youtube want to service in Turkey they have to pay taxes. This decision makes people confusing. Third is about bonus in bank. Banks in Europe are providing bonus even if they have financial problems. The issue is the bonus is too much in the period of financial problems. Fourth is about new energy resources. One is solar system which uses sun as resource and the other is bio gas which uses animal's wastes and human's wastes. Next is a spy from central asia published a book which has information of terrorists. Because of this U. S government allows the spy to live in U. S. Last news is scientists found whale's teeth which are from long long time ago. This discovery can help to research how species are changed.
