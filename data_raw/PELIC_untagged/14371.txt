I remember the park where I played when I was a child. There were the park in front of the apartment where my family lived. I could see the park from my apartment. In the park there were large ground children could play. I often played with my friends who lived in the same apartment. At that time I was a only child who could not ride the bicycle so I practiced to ride bicycle with my farther very hard . Finally I could ride the bicycle by myself in the park. This is my sweet memory which I never forget. There is stil the park whenever I go to the park I feel homesick for my childhood.
