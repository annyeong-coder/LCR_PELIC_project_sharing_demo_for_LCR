I want to introduce how to make a green tea essence pack for keeping fair skin. It is easy to make a pack if you follow several steps. First of all prepare a soft thin towel green tea and honey. Second mix the green tea and honey in the ratio of 1 to 2. You should make it thick for applying to your face. After that make the tower wet enough and then heat it in the microwave for a short time. Be sure not to overheat because if you overheat it it's too hot to cover your face. Next wash your face with warm water. Warm water makes your skin put off bad things. After washing use toner for cleansing your skin and contracting the pores enough. After that attach the tower on your face and place the green tea pack on the tower for 20 minutes. Finally take off the tower and don't wash your face. Just apply for essence to your face and take a rest. It's my secret to keep fair skin. If you try this way you could have fair skin like the White Princess.
