My soul mate is a women that is very spiritual. Who is totally aware. Who is able to listen as well as talk in a conversation. Who is in good health and practice good health. Who also is willing to do many different things. Someone who is secure enough with him self that she can easily accept and encourage a successful ambitious me. She is beautiful to my eyes. She has nice dark hair. She is tall about 5' 9 or over and someone who is similar but enough of a difference to make me grow. Someone who can be humble and confident. Someone who is willing to accept no matter what their age. Someone who is smart has a good sense of humor enjoys travelling.
