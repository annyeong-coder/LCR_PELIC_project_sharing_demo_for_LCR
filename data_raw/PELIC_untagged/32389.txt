I am living in a nice apartment. It is very clean up. Moreover I can hang out with my neighbors at the park and play around. It is located near my apartment. However it has some damages. First the dish washer did not throw out the water last weekend. I called the maintenance many times but the maintenance's engineer asked me to call them back in the working hours and he hanged up.
