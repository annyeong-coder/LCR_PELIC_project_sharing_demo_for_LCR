I think that students are usually free from pressures. They can often do what they want to. They have many friends to turn to. They have more free time than others. In fact I have ever rarely feel pressures as a student. However it is not true that everything always goes fine. Sometimes they run up against a wall. Once it start annoying it might be hard to fix the problem. One reason for pressure is studying. I think it is the most common cause of pressure. Getting good grade is important to enter the good schools or to take a job with big company. Students want to get good grade. Their families also want them to get good grade. But it is not easy to do. Sometimes having other things they can not make a time to study. Even if studying hard they can not always get good grade. It can be a pressure for them. In Japan many parents make their child go a cram school from their childhood. It makes competition harder and their families often give them a pressure by expecting. Other reason is relationship. If they can not make a good Relationship with friends or teachers or families it becomes a pressure. It is difficult for children to make a good relationship. Actually I have seen the problems of bullying on TV or newspapers. There are students who kill themselves because they distress by bullying. Whether you can live a full life or not depends on relationship. It is true for everyone. I think that school is the place where is not only for studying but also for practicing making relationship. The other reason is personal things. They might have troubles with what to do after graduate. People are often annoyed with their existence in adolescent. If students feel the pressures they do not have to be nervous and hasty. Being student they are in a time that they prepare for becoming working member of society. It is natural that they have things that they can not do. They have much time. They can solve it slowly.
