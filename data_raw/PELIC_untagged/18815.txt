I learned many things in the ELI this semester. However the most important thing is that I learned about many cultures from all over the world. I met and studied with people from different parts of the world in the ELI classes. Now I know a lot about their cultures such as the Japanese Chinese Chilean Mongolian and the Turkish cultures. And even them now they know about my culture or at least I correct their incorrect image about us. Like some of them think that we still use camels as transportation. This is one of many benefits of studying in the ELI. And I hope I will meet with people from other parts of the world next semester to learn about their culture.
