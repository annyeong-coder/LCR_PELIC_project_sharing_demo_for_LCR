Hello!! I'm Ana Vaira I've been living in EE. UU. Since October 2004. I've written this web page becouse I want to share some of my experiences here. When I arrived in EE. UU. I was very anxious and nervous. My English was so bad I didn't know how to drive and my son was in his terribles twos . But I've always been an optimistic person. . . . . Now my son grew up I've learned how to drive and I've been taking English class. My hobby. . . . . I like to dance and latelly I've found and exciting Zumba class. This class has become very popular in EE. UU. I've posted pictures and videos of the last Zumba Master Class . I've hope you enjoy them.
