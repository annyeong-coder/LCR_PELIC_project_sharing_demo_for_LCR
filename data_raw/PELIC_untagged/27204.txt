If I'm going to live alone on a deserted island I'll take some chocolates fresh water solar radio fishing equipment and a book Navigating by the stars. Fresh water is very important to human. People can't be alive without fresh water for 3 days in deserted island. I think sometimes it's hard to find the water source. Chocolate contain high calories if you can't find any food calories maybe can help you to spend the tough time. Solar radio will give you much information. If you are lost you need a book to tell you how to recognize the directions and the stars are the good coordinates. If you have fishing equipment you can hunt fish it will extend your life and have some fun.
