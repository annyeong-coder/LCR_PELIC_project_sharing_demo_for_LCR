I moved to the U. S. A. In Feb 2007. When I enrolled the middle school I first studied English. My older sister got married in 1969 when I graduated the middle school in 1968. While I was playing soccer at my high school. I met my best friend. When I got a job in 1980 I graduated from the university in 1981. While I was working at a company I learned how to play golf. I met a beautiful girl who is now my wife at the Seolak mountain while I was climbing the mountain. While I was reading a newspaper my son was playing on the computer. I had my daughter in 1988 when I worked at the Hyundai construction co. Ltd. My daughter was working on a part time job when she was studying at a university. When my mother died at home in 1997 I cried along with my family. My daughter graduated at a high school in Pittsburgh while I was working at a company in Korea. My nephew was arriving in Pittsburgh while I was studying at ELI on the last summer semester.
