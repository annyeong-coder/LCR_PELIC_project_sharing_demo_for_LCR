What I listened for outside listening report is Michelle Obama's interview. She choose some questions which were sent to her over twitter and answer the questions. The first question was what her hopes and dreams for her daughters are. She said that she wants her daughters to find things that will give them passion and also hope that they're never afraid to take risk to achieve their goals. The second question was who her role model is and she answered her role model is her parents who worked hard and sacrificed themselves for their children. The third one was what kind of advice she can give to young women. She said the most important thing is believing yourself and finding mentors. The last question was about eating healthy especially for children. She recommended letting their children pick fresh produced fruits and vegetables in anywhere and anytime.
