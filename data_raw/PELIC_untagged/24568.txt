Armani Last Name Outside Reading Assignment 2 4 1 2010 According to Richard Hooker Language is a complicated and interesting episode. The differences between terms of languages are impossible to equate and one needs to focus on the words and the way in which native speakers often use them. Native American languages are varying. There are around 2000 dialogues roughly 200 are spoken in North America 300 400 are spoken in Central America and 1400 1500 are still spoken in South America. Nobody until now has showed up to understand the principal of a representative version of these dialogues. European languages all generally have the same characteristics. The most common differences are between objects and actions that are included in declarative sentences. When verbs work together with nouns in such a way that they appear to blend it suggests that a culture doesn't separate objects from actions. European languages separate actions from objects. The languages also distinguish differences in time such as past present and future. Native American languages however do not. For example the Navaho verb intertwines many things. European languages do not do this. Agglutinative defines North American languages because they use combinations of words to replace one single word. These words often are used in reference to a part of a sentence as well. The English words for tendency are used to elongate the utterance opposed to suppressing it. Agglutinative languages link words much closer together than most other languages.
