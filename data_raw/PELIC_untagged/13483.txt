I met my best friend who looks like me in the university orientation class. We took many classes because we were in the same department of fashion design. Many professors who were in the university found it difficult to distinguish us. She has two brothers and four sisters. Her family members are related to art. Many of them are artists. My best friend whose father was a famous sculptor in Korea. Her younger sister who got married with a rich man has her own gallery. Now my friend works as a director in the art gallery. The gallery which was design by her brother who is a architectur is located in the downtown in Seoul. Now it became famous modern building in Seoul.
