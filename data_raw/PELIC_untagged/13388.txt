I really enjoy trying new food when I travel to foreign countries. However I have a nightmare about it and it was the worst meal I have ever had. It was the buffet in the Bin tan Lagoon hotel in the Indonesia. I do not have any chance to choose restaurant during travel because it was package trip so I had to follow the plan. When I heard that we are going to eat buffet I was happy because we can try various foods at buffet. However when I got there I was very surprised because all foods are made of seafood such as fish and shellfishes. It was a terrible because I can't eat seafood. I tried to find other kinds of food which made of vegetable of meat but I did not have choice. Therefore I had to eat a loaf of bread and I drink milk orange juice and water whole day. It was a new year's day and the hotel prepared many kinds of dancing however I did not have any energy to enjoy performance. Moreover I drank a glass of red wine to celebrate New Year's Day but it made me feel sick because I did not eat anything before drink wine. We stayed there three days and I lost six pounds. For my sister and parents it was fantastic world because they really like seafood however for me it was the worst food.
