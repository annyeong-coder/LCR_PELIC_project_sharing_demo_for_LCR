Last month I went to my best friend's house. We went to the sky station. The sky station is very beautiful. There was a turist lost and I could help his with my basic english. It was very freezing but we could enjoy. We didn't take anything along because if you want you can rent all things there. We skying during all day. Then we didn't eat nothing during all day. After we go back home and cooking a dinner. Finally we had a good dinner in this day.
