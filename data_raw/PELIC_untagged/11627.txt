When I was in high school I did very well in history and dreamed to be a famous historian. In order to attain this goal I studied very hard and got good score in every historical test. My history teacher often said to me If you choose history to be your major you will be a good historian in the future. At that time I decided that I would choose history department when I attended in university. A teacher in the student office told me You can save most tuition and can study in the university which is close to your home if you enter history department. However when I began to choose major before my college entrance examination I chose accounting instead of history because my parents persuaded me that it was very difficult to find a job after graduating if I studied history. Finally I accepted their suggestion and changed my major. Now I have graduated from the business school of Sun Yat Sen University. Sometimes I think the decision I made ten years ago. If I had chosen history to be my major I would not have studied in Sun Yat Sen University. If I had not studied in Sun Yat Sen University I would not have met my husband and come to the US with him. Life is very interesting. But I still feel a little pity. Sometimes I wish I hadn't abandoned history. If I were a historian now my life would be very different.
