Usually my little child cheers me up and he is laughing too much when I pick him up. He makes me angry when he turns the light off since I am reading. So I would like to change the position of the light's key. Also I am planning to paint my room with a bright color but I have not decided yet about the color and I will discuss it when I get back to my house. Before doing that I will touch its walls up.
