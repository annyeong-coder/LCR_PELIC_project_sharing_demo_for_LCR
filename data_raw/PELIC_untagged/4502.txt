I have been most influenced by a chief nurse who was my co woker. I was encouraged by her when I failed my task. I was taught by her to take care of patients with our kindness. It was seemed that she was a angel. After I was a chief nurse it would say that young nurses are persuaded by me to take care of patients with our kindness. I am still inspired by young nurses who I taught. The chief nurse will always be remembered by me and a lot of patients as a important person in our life.
