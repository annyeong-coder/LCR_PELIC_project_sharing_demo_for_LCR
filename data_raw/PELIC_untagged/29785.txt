In my opinion joining Second Life is a good idea for ELI students. The first reason is making friends over the world. Actually students don't have many chance and time to make friends in real life. But on the internet students can make friends easily and can choose what kind of friends to make with. For example students meet a person who has the same hobbies online. They have the same topic to talk about and can share the experience together. They don't think about how the person look like is and rich or not. The second reason is learning knowledge. Since the internet is getting more and more popular more and more students use it for studying. Ther are a lot of resource on the internet. It makes life easier. They don't have to go to library to get what the information they want. Furthermore communication on the internet in different language whic students interested in will improve their language skill. The last reason is reducing pressure. Nowaday a lot of students get huge of pressure from study society living. They need to relax for a while. They may complain with friends of the internet without worry about any trouble because nobody really know who you really are. Also students can play the games online with friends. They can forget everything
