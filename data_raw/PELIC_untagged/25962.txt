My soul mate is someone who helps me to overcome difficult situations in life and who teaches me to discover essential values such as openness and responsibility. A very nice soul mate is one who knows how to make me happy with simple things. Sometimes people think that only big things make a person happy but I think that the value of small things is unparalleled. This person is someone who looks after your welfare and who regards dreaming together is great.
