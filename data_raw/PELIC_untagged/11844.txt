My favorite place to eat lunch in Oakland is Oishi. There are 4 reasons why I like that restaurant. First it is Korean restaurant. Because I am Korean I miss Korean food sometimes. There are lots of Korean foods there. For example they have Bibimbop Bulgogi Kimchi and so on. Besides the taste is good. It is just same as what I used to have in Korea. Second they have also Japanese food although the owner is Korean. I can have Japanese food there also such as Sushi Udon Roll and so on. Third its cost is cheap. The most of its cost is about 6 and under 10 at least. Because I am a student I don't have much money so I can save money if I go there. Most importantly it is closed to Cathedral of learning. I usually don't have much time to eat lunch after I wait for my friends and put my books in the locker. In fact there is a Korea restaurant that serves better food compare to Oishi it is too far from Cathedral of learning. For these reasons I often go to Oishi to eat lunch.
