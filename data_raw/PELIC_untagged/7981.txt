I had never thought I could go aboard alone with my poor English. That was my first time I went aboard. I had spent last hour in Thailand with my family in Bankok International Airport. I had gone to the departure lounge with a carry on and a backpack 1 hour before departure time. When I was waiting I noticed that people around me were all foreigners. I kept worrying about what I was supposed to do if I got lost in other airports or wanted to order more food on the plane. After I got on the plane I realized that my long frustrated journey had just begun.
