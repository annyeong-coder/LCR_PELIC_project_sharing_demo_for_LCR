My best friend Hazem is someone who is very helpful. He lives in a house which is very big. I can depend on him in many things which make me feel better. Sometimes he comes to my house which is very big to study together. He has many friends who are friends with me too. I sit next him in class which is small. His face is look like my face that is very beautiful.
