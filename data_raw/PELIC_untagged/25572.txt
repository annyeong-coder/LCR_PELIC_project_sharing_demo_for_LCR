My favorite meal is AL baik which is a fast food. It always comes with four pieces of chicken. It has a big amount of spice. It is served with some potato and a garlic sauce. I eat it with a cup of water. After that I usually eat some desert . One cake or two pieces of chocolate. Sometime I add a cup of milk with the desert. I know it's not healthy but I try sometimes to eat vegetables.
