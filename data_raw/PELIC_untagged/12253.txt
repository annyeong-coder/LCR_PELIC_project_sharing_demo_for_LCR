I disagree. I have three points of the view. 1. If parents and teachers pay attention to their creativity and interesting in their growing of the progress instruct and encourage them children can remain and increase their curiosity. 2. With more experience they open their mind and distinguish which is their real creativity and interesting. 3. There are many choices and creativities what they want. They engage their own learning.
