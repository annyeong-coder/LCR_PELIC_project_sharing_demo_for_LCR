Good things happen when you least expect them . Surprised . Excited . A good job . A lot of money . Win a big race champion . Call my parents my best friend . Talk about it with my husband then enjoy it One day when I was made a meal for lunch my phone rang. A delighted women's said to me Is this ANON_NAME_0 you were employed by Xiaya Hospital please you come here tomorrow. I only say thank you thank you . . . I could not belived I opened my mouth. I was so excited. You know this was my first good job. After a while I call my parents at once and my best friend just tell them good news. I asked for my husband to go back home. I want to enjoy it with him.
