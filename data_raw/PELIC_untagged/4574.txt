Music has many different ways for people to express. Some of them like to use it to sing others like to play. There also have different kinds of ways to sing by music. One is teenagers' favorite pop music. Some of them like rock music others like R B and others like RAP. People who like rock music have two choices. First is heavy metal. This kind of music could make you deaf because it's loud and noise. If you don't like heavy metal you have another choice. You can try light metal. This is much more comfortable for our ears to listen to. I like light metal the most but when I feel depressed I'll listen to heavy metal to express my feelings. Another kind of music is classical music which is musicians' favorite. People are familiar with Bach and Beethoven the most especially Beethoven. He's the most popular musician. Sometimes listen to classical music can help us relax. For the people who have insomnia it might be more helpful than taking medicine. The other music production is drama in which actors need to sing and act. Mei's Shadow of The Opera and Cats are famous by people. Almost everyone in the world knows these two dramas. Even if they never see any one of them they might have heard the song from the show. I never wanted to see a drama but after I saw Cats advertisement it really got me interested. If I get some time I will go to see Cats. Music has many different ways for us to listen to or to admire it. We can always find the way we like. By listening to music you can find more songs you never heard before and you might fall in love with them.
