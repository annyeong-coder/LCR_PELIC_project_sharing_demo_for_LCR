In 2006 I went to China for a trip with my company. At that place I ate the multiplicity of Chinese tradition foods. Especially I was impressed the 'beggar chicken dish'. The dish is easy to cook but very delicious. This dish's name stems from an old China story. Once upon a time in China some king got lost in forest when he went for a walk. He got tired and got hungry. At this time he smelled a very delicious food's smell. He found that a group of beggar ate some food. That food was 'beggar chicken'. There are several materials how to cook this dish such as bamboo leaves china traditional spices a spray of the wood for fuel and chicken. First you should dig the ground and burn wood for making hot the ground. Second you should add the china traditional spices to the chicken. And then you should wrap in the chicken in the bamboo leaves. Finally you should put the chicken in the hot ground and wait until well cooking.
