Rob tried to coordinate a trip to Niagara Falls last summer. He made an announcement about it to all the student in ELI. Most of them are interesting of the trip. Also he was working very hard to success the trip coordination. Then they went to Niagara Falls and had fun there. Everything was coordinated. We can say Rob is a great coordinator.
