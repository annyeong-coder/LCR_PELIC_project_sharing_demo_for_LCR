I grew up in Bangkok a capital of Thailand. In my lifetime my family had moved for 3 times. I have a lot of memories in my first house where my family was living when I was born. This house had two floors the first floor had living room dining room and kitchen. All of our bedrooms and a room of worship were in the second floor. In front of my house had a small pond in which I cried very loud when I fell into it but I found it was very shallow then I was walking up by myself before my mother reached me. Beside of my house it was a lawn that my mother planted many kinds of trees. I really love our rose apple tree where my brother and I usually climbed up. When the weather was good not too hot my family always did some activities in this lawn such as played badminton picnic etc. I had been living in this house until I was 13 years old then I moved to a new one that still in Bangkok.
