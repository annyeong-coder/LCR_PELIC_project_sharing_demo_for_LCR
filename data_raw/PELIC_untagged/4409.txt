The number of Hispanic in New Orleans has been increasing since Harricane Kattina attacked the city becase there are lots of jobs such as reconstruction. According to the 2000 census they used to be just 3 in New Orleans and 67 of residents were American African. Some of Hispanic are legal residents from other states and some of them are illegal immigrants from South of the border. It causes some damage to African American which is that the wage of them is getting decrease because Latinos work at the low wage although the living conditon of Latino day labors is terrible. They also hope that it will change.
