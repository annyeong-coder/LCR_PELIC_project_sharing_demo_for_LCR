I know that some of you are discouraged because it is taking you so long to run five miles but don't give up yet . First look on the chart is be easy to understand . It is so difficult to run first time five miles but you take long time to be running fast . Second the second year it was very easy to running five miles. Maybe you toke short time but not the same the first years. Next when you are practice the running every day will be easy and don't take long time. Then there are some years the same time to running. Finally if you are running very years. You should time grow down that mean you are improve the running. Look the chart it is clear to understand the every years the time grow down.
