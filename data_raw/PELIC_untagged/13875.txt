I decided we're going to picnic on Schenley Park. We'll play Frisbee and football. I'll bring them with me. Also I'll take some chocolates and some sandwiches with me. After we finished some activities we can have lunch together. And I'll bring a lot of water and some juice. Because we may feel thirsty between picnic.
