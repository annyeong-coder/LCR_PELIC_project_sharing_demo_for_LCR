When I was a child my country used to have less tecnology than now because the internet is changing everything. I used to study with books but now I study with internet. Computers used to be very large and we didn't have personal computers now people got used to working on personal computers and the computers are smaller. When I was younger I often used to go to the cinema but now I prefer to watch movies in my house because I have cable TV with high resolution and DVD. In my country the public transportation used to be limited but now it is better. Also when I was a child many women didn't use to work but now there are women that work in all kind of professions.
