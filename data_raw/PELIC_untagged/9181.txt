When I was an undergraduate student in Japan I did many researches. Just one or two experiments had good results. I should have considered more before I started the experiment. One of my coworker was lazy. I gave him warning but I thought his boss should have jumped on him. And I should not have given him so many warnings because he cowered at me.
