Last summer I went to Thailand for trip with my friends. We really wanted to enjoy shopping and traveling. In addition we were looking forward to eating Thai food and we tried to eat Thai food eight times and I experienced worst meal I've ever had. When we got there first we wanted to experience Thai culture so we went to traditional market which is in Bangkok and nobody used English in. We ordered 3 dishes and 3 cups of soda. However I couldn't eat any more because those were too spicy and too disgusting to eat. After 8 attempts I gave up eating Thai food and I went to Outback steak house and TGIF restaurant.
