I have a lot of good friends. My best friend who lives in Izmir calls me often. Izmir is a city which is my hometown. He is married a while ago. He has a daughter whose name is Melisa. I have seen her picture which is beautiful. They moved to another city Istanbul where I want to see that city. I knew his wife whose went to the collage with me. My best friend and I used to go to the restaurant where he met his wife where in Izmir. I have a best friend whose friends are important to him. My best friend was my neighbor whose house was next to us. That's how we met.
