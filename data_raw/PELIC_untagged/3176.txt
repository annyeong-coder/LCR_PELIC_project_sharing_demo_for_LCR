There are four people in my family. My mother WHO HAS THREE CHILDREN is a successful businesswoman. She owns a company and raises us by herself. My elder sister WHO LIVES IN TAIPEI is a Japanese teacher. She found she loves learning Japanese while she was studying at college. My brother WHO WORKS IN A RESTAURANT likes to drive fast. He wants to be a race car driver but my mom didn't agree with that. On the weekends my mom likes to bring us to visit her sister WHO LIVES IN TAICHUNG COUNTY. We always have a lot of fun there.
