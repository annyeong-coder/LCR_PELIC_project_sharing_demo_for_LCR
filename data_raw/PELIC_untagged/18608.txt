I grew up in a nice neighborhod that was owned by my grandfather. I have seven uncles who were living near to our house. My uncle ANON_NAME_0 who was older than my father was very nice to me. I loved him so much. I have twenty three cuisens seven of them who were the same of my age were my close friends. My oldest uncle whose name is ANON_NAME_1 was the boss of our big family. He was very kind he taught me how to ride his horse which he gave to my old brother. Friday was special day because it was the day when we go to my family's farm to have picnic with my whole family. My family's farm was near to the beach where we went to swim in summer time.
