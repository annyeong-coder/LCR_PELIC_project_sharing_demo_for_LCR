It is common today about the skills required to get a good job nowadays. There will be three main points I will be discussing such as academic personal management and teamwork skills. Firstly academic skills are probably the most important skill you will need to get a job. For example an employer looks for in an employee they are skills which give you the basic foundation to acquire hold on to and advance in a job and to achieve the best results. Secondly personal management skills can be further divided into three sub groups just as academic skills which are positive attitudes and behaviors responsibility and adaptability. For example you must have good self esteem and confidence in yourself. And you must have the ability to identify and suggest new ideas to get the job done. Thirdly teamwork skills are those skills needed to work with others cooperatively on a job and to achieve the best results. For example you should show your employer you able to work with others understand and contribute to the organization's goals. Involve yourself in the group make good decisions with others and support the outcomes. Don't be narrow minded listen to what others have to say and give your thoughts towards their comments. Be a leader not a loner in the group. Finally I would like to say that all these skills I have discussed are critical to get keep and progress in a job and to achieve the best results possible for you. Of these skills though academic skills would be the most important skills you will learn I think. So if you keep at these skills you will be happy with what you are doing unlike a lot of people who are forced to get jobs that they do not like.
