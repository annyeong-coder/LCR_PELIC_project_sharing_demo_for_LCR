I think having a pets it s a good idea. Two days ago my husband s friends gave us a cat. She is so funny and very smart. We can play with the cat. I like to talk with her. I think she can understend me. Our life became more interesting. I think when people have a pets they become kinder. Because they have to care the cat. When you come back home you know that somebody wait for you. Especially if you live alone it s great opportunity not feel lonely.
