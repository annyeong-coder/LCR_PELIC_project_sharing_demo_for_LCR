I had summer vacation two years ago. I had enough time. First I was plannig to trip. I prepared some food and some water a few clothes in backpack. And then I preserved a train ticket. The next day I went to Sulak mountain by the train. But I didn't have any information of mountain. I arrived at Sulak mountain. I made an ascent of a mountain for 12 hours. When I took a stand at top I had enough impression by nature. When I went down at mountain I had little food and water. Finally when I got to home I had sleep for 20 hours. Because I didn't have enough sleep.
