As we know that the kingdom of Saudi Arabia is the most important country to produce oil and export it to many countries. Yunbua and Al Jobail have the biggest two oil wells. However people whom live there have suffered from air pollution that has been caused by oil refinement. We can limit the damages by moving these factories to an empty area or creating a new city for the citizens. Chronic diseases namely all kinds of cancer blindness and asthma are the most common diseases which have been caused by oil refinement. The people have denounced to move them away to a desert. Lawyers were haired to defend the citizens from air pollution. They suggest building factories in a desert and pumping the oil to those factories. Nowadays the government is studying the lawyers' propose. Causing lots of dilemmas by oil refinement have pushed the government to think about creating a new city for the citizens. This is another solution that the lawyers provided the government to solve the problem. Some of gave heard about Saudi Arabia and its spacious area. The government has thought to build two new cities near to the capital Al Riyadh and move the people to their new homes. This movement is regarded as the most expensive solution in the history of Saudi Arabia. There are many solutions to reduce the damages of air pollution but creating new cities and moving oil factories are the most reasonable. The government must have thought about air pollution as a result many people were killed and some still struggling from diseases. I hope that we could solve oil refinement issue as soon as possible.
