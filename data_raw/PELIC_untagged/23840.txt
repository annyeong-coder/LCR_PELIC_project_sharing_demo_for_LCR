I am from China and I live in Beijing . Beijing is the largest city in China . I think Beijing is the most interesting and exciting city . Always you can find the least expensive car on the road. And you can buy the least expensive apartment in Beijing . But there are too many people in Beijing so Beijing has become one of the most crowded city in China . A lot of people know Beijing is the oldest city in China.
