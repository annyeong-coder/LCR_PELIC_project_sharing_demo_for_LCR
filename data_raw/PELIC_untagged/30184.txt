Some people think women can serve in the army as well as men even though the men have more advantages rather than women. The male soldiers can serve better than female soldiers because the men have three principal advantages. The men are characterized as having durability and they are more capable of facing any enemy. Also they are able to sustain in the most difficult circumstances. The male soldiers usually have a strong physique so they can use and carry weapons easily. The last point is that the male soldiers can control their emotions while the female soldiers cannot. The male soldiers always do not let their emotions affect themselves.
