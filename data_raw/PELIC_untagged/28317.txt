I meet my conversation partner whose name is Tyler who majors in Chinese and politics to discuss something that involves American lifestyle and the politics in Taiwan and do my homework which is assigned by teachers who are teaching in ELI at the Starbucks which is located at the corner of Forbes Avenue and Atwood Street for about two hours in the afternoon when I finish ELI classes on Thursdays.
