Oct. 16 2006 Dear mom Recently I noticed that most students have either a laptop or a desktop because they can use them to do their homework and get some information about the course. Thus I think I may need a laptop or a desktop. I prefer to buy a laptop because in my opinion a laptop is more convenient for me for three reasons. First I can bring a laptop with me when I go to school. For example if I need to search some information on the website in school I can use the wireless immediately. Second the size and weight of a laptop is smaller and lighter than a desktop. It'll be easier for me to bring it with me because I can put it in my backpack. Lastly laptops are more practical than desktops because I can use a laptop while giving a talk or doing a presentation. For instance when I want to present my speech by using Powerpoint a laptop is quite useful. Therefore I think I'll buy a laptop. If you have any suggestions please tell me. Love
