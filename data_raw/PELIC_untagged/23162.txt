Teaching styles Last semester when I came to study in ELI I met few teachers who taught me some English classes. I have noticed some similarities and differences among them. Teachers are alike in their behavior and how much they give homework while there are different in the way of how they teach and how they deal with student in class. First of all speaking teacher and grammar teacher are similar in their behavior. This means that both of them are smiling all the time which gives crucial effect to students and it reflects on their grades. This means if students are happy with teachers they will make extra efforts in their classes. In addition both of them enhance students to work with them as friends not as students and teachers. However speaking teacher brought some extra materials which helps students to understand more during the class while grammar teacher restrict with curriculum. This means that speaking teacher adding new techniques to the class. This new techniques reveal extra benefits to the students and do not keep them feeling bored. Speaking teacher dealt with students in individual way and tried to explain to each student who did not understand any topic. On the other hand grammar teacher explained the topics generally and sometime few topics are ambiguous and to be more clearer than it was. In conclusion grammar teacher and speaking teacher are the same in terms of their personalities and how much they give an assignment. Furthermore grammar teacher teach in a general way but speaking teacher is going in detail. Thus students were trend toward speaking teacher rather than grammar teacher. ANON_NAME_0 Last Name
