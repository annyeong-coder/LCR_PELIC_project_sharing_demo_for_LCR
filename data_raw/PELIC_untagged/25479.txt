When I was in high school I used to live with my parents. We used to eat dinner together. I used to drink Arabic coffee with my family in the backyard. My family and I used to visit my grand parents. My father used to drive me to school. My brothers and I used to play cards each weekend. My friends used to play soccer during lunch hour. After school I used to ride my bicycle home. I never used to smoke cigarettes. ANON_NAME_0 who is my best friend used to smoke in a park.
