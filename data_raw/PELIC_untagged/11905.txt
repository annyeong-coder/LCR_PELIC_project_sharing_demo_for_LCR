The most interesting experience I have had with money was about 15 years ago. When I was 12 I went to my aunt's house. My aunt gave me a new pink wallet for my birthday present. It was pretty and I liked it so much. After few hours my family left her house and headed to my house by subway. My family was waiting for a train at the station and I kept looking and touching my new wallet. Suddenly the train came in and our family was in hurry to take the train. Our family rushed into the train and sat down. When we passed almost 5 stops I knew that I left my wallet at the station. I started crying and our family had to go back to the station but my wallet had already disappeared. The wallet didn't have much money in it but it was a big shock for me. Afterward I got a phobia against the wallet. I have to check my wallet every time after I use it. I cannot forget that day through my whole life.
