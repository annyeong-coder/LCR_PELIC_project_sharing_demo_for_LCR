MY ideal neighbors are reliable and helpful. When I have some problems that I can't solve by myself I can ask them for help. I hope they are neat and considerate because it can make our surrounding clean and we can live happily in a beautiful environment. I hope they don't turn the music loudly when the time is late. I hope they are not so serious and gloomy because we all have heavy pressure in the day time I need a quite and comfortable place to rest completely.
