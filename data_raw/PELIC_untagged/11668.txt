If I didn't met him It is my husband's birthday today. We have celebrated his birthday together three times since we fell in love and we have been married for one and half years. Sometimes one question flashes in my mind what would my life be if I hadn't met my husband I think I would be working as a doctor and living with my parents in my hometown. In addition it is common in China that doctors get married with their colleagues whom they spend most time to contact with. So most probably my husband would be a doctor instead of a researcher in lab. I knew my husband in 2004 when I was a master student in Microbiology. Choosing it as my major is the most important decision which has exerted far reach influences on my life. If I hadn't chosen this major I wouldn't have had opportunities to study in Hong ANON_NAME_0 University as a exchange student If I hadn't gone to Hong ANON_NAME_0 University I wouldn't have known my husband If I hadn't gotten married with my husband I wouldn't go to the United States. Before we knew each other our lives like two parallels which never intertwine I lived in Nanning a city located in Southern China and had never left my hometown while my husband grew up in the Wuhan a city located in the middle of China and studied as a PhD student in Beijing. However as Chinese aphorism put it fate brings people together even if they are far away . Because my mater advisor has cooperated with a professor in Hong ANON_NAME_0 University who has collaborated with my husband's supervisor so my husband went to Nanning to carry out his PhD program in Nanning and I as a native person in Nanning was asked to assist him. Since then we fell in love. I think my husband is a gift god gives me. Before I got married I wish my lover would looks neat and have an affected smile. Most importantly I wish he would keep a childlike innocence and understand me. Fortunately my husband exact is a person who I expect. Although if only he was more sensitive.
