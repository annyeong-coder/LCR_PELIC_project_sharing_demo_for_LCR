I have read many books that either were in my major or others. There was the book that is called Time management . That book affected my life because its author has lots of experience witch add to the book a strong influence on the reader especially in the last chapter that has the conclusion of his experience . I have decided to buy that book after I had some problems that made me angry. The book consist s of six chapters that are considered abstract for the successful man who is the book author. When I followed his recommendations that are in the book I found myself has control on a time.
