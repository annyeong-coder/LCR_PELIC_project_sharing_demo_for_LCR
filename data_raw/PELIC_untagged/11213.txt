I think the Olympics are becoming more popular because they are the international activities. For example they are on behalf of all the people of the world and countries compare each other in the competition. They contain many sports items in order to show all of the countries that their best aspect so the players of all countries practice their skills and abilities many years in order to have the best expression. All countries also have a chance to spread their culture and development if they are voted after many phase of process. For instance sightseers players and related persons that many countries will visit the host city so it's important that the government how to prepare and support all of the related events like safety hotels transportation race stadium etc. Before they begin. Finally there are many counties to apply to be a host city every two years but the competition is very violent and difficult. It's easy to see why the Olympics are becoming more popular.
