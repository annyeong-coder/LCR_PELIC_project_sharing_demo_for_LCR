When I came to pittsburgh I just thought that East American is unkind people but sometimes my thought is wrong. Before I used to live at Portland OR. I decided to move to here and I told my friend. My friend told me East America is different from West America and usually East American is unkind people. I just believed my friend. After that I moved to here. First time I came here and I went to downtown. I wanted look around there. Then I lost my way. At that time I just have a bus time schedule. I didn't know where am I where can I take a bus I walked along gazing around. Suddenly one woman hit my shoulder and she told me where do you find I answered I want to take a 61d bus and I find fifth ave at market st. Bus station. She walked me to bus station. I was thankful to her and I realized that I had a wrong information about East American. I was wrong. After that I changed my mind. Unkind person is depend on person. It is not continous with area. Now I have a good image about Pittsburgh and East American.
