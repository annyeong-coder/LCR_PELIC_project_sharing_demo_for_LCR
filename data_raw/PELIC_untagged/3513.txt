03 19 07 Dear ANON_NAME_0 I recently went BEST BUY. There were many televisions but I saw two beautiful televisions. The first one was from JVC. It is price was 1900. This television has highly desirable features. For example it is black and it has a DVD player. It looks modern. This television is a 32 inch. The second one was from SONY. It costs 2500. It is silver. It has a DVD player. This television is a 27 inch. I prefer the first one for three reasons. First it is not too expensive. Second it is color is more beautiful than the other. Finally it is bigger so if you want the television please call me because I will buy the television this weekend. I miss you
