My personality is a mix of more than one group. I am not introvert but at the same time I do not like to talk with people who make me feel uncomfortable. In addition to that I think I belong to intuitive group. Also I am thinker and feeler in the same time. Sometimes I take issues personally other time not. In the last category I'm more judger than perceiver. I'm form the kind of people who like to take forward decisions. Furthermore people whose personalities like me have more chance to get along with wide verity of other people. The environment where you grow up and the family in which you live control the type of personality that you will have. On the other hand there is no one study that can totally define the personality of person.
