I have two friends who are known from middle school. One of them is now my best friend in Korea. Her name is ANON_NAME_0 a. She is someone whose personality is very out going. If she goes to new place that has many strangers she can make new friends very easily. The other close friend is ANON_NAME_1 na. She was living an apartment which is very near from my home so we saw each other almost every day. Although I'm living here in U. S I talk with them very often. Their characteristics are very similar to me so when I talk with them I feel comfortable.
