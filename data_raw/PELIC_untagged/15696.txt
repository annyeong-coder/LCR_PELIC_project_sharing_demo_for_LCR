I agree with Charles Stangor who stated that people employ stereotypes mainly to simplify how they think about others and to enhance their views of themselves and the groups to which they belong. Therefore I think a generalization about other people become harmful stereotypes when this generalization is a dreadful judgment. For example if we describe Chinese people as hard worker it's acceptable but when describe Italians as lazy it's not. In my opinion we should keep the encouraging and positive generalization better than the negative ones.
