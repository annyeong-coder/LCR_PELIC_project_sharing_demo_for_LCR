Each country has problems but the country usually focuses on the biggest problem. In my country the biggest problem is that seventy percent of population do not have own homes. I think this problem is strange because the area of Saudi Arabia is large and the population is not huge. In my opinion the government can solve this problem if they followed the other countries that faced such this problem. It is not a problem if they benefit from the experience of others. Also the main cause for this problem may be because of people who have a lot of white lands the lands that are not used so the people can't buy. To solve this the government should impose an annual fee on these lands. As a result people might sell the lands cheaply.
