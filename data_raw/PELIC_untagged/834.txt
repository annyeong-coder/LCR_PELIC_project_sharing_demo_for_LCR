Otc. 16. 2006 Dear Mom I need a new computer my computer is too old to use it . You know my computer I used it for five years now it's too old . When I use it to work it always let me become upset . Can you buy a new computer for me I think I want to own an ipod computer . You know that many students use it in American it's easy and good for students . Yes it price is a little high than other computers but it's good for me . When I use it I feel comfortable and relax . You know that like HP and SONY its are a little different from ipod . I like ipod it's design so easy they have black and white color for choice . I prefer white ipod more than black ipod . If you have time please order a computer on internet for me thank you! Love
