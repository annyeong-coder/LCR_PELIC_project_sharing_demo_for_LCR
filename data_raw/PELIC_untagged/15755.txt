There are many people I respect. I can't pick one person because all of them are esteemed for me. My grandmother is one of them. She always gives me some advice. When I was young I didn't really hear her. I think I was kind of immature. I have realized many things that she was telling me. She has been right for everything. By the way my parents are also respectful people. They also give me many advice. Sometimes it is hard to follow these advice though. But I am trying to keep lots of advice that they give me.
