I have come to the United States with my husband for his job. But I have been studying English these days. I was taking an English conversation class in Japan after going back to Japan from Germany. However I had often to put breaks on the class because I had to take care of my grandchildren. In the class I couldn't speak so much but listening to the pronunciation or the fluency of students who studied at ESS in England or America was very useful for me.
