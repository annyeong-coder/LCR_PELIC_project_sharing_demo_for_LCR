The song from my country I found a song that is called K pop. K pop means Korean pop that makes me relax. The title of song is 'Americano' which is a type of coffee. The song was directed by '10cm' whose songs are very freestyle. '10Cm' is not very famous group in Korea. Because they are new group of sing a song writer who emerged TV on March 2011. When I get stress I usually listen K pop music. So that songs make me comfortable is obivous.
