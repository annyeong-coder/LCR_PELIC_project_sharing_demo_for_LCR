Left Handedness Do you know anyone who is left handed You probably do. About 10 percent of the population uses their left rather than their right hand for writing and other tasks. Although many athletes musicians artists and world leaders are left handed being left handed certainly has a few disadvantages in a world designed by and for right handed people. Social situations can provide opportunities for left handed people to feel clumsy. First of all it is handshakes. Right handed people offer their right hands and expect to grasp the right hand of the other person. The instinct of left handers however is to extend their left hand. They have to train themselves to extend their right. Another social opportunity for awkwardness occurs at the dinner table. Left handed diners constantly bump elbows with a right handed person unless they sit at the far end of the table with no one on their left. What's worse left handers have to concentrate in order to avoid grabbing and drinking from the wrong glass. Left handed people can face inconveniences at school too. Consider the chairs in classrooms with little fold up desktops for taking notes. Most of them are made for right handers. Left handers have to write with their left elbow hanging in midair. Or else they have to turn themselves around almost 180 degrees in order to lay their notebook on the desk. Furthermore when lefties write in a three ring binder or spiral notebook. The rings get in the way of their hands when they write on the front side of a page. Finally left handers write from left to right so their hand smears the fresh ink across the page. Last but not least are the many inventions of the modern world. That makes life convenient for right handers but inconvenient for lefties. These include scissors can openers corkscrews automobile gear shifts cameras and computer keyboards. In sum in a world organized for right handers left handed people must confront and overcome challenges every day.
