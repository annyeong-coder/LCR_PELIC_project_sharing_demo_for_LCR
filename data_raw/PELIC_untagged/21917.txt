Hello everyone. I'm writing this to introduce myself. My name is ANON_NAME_0 Last Name and I'm from Korea. I arrived here three weeks ago. So this is my first semester in the Pitts ELI course. And now I'm living in Oakland. So I always walk to the school. I'm planning to study here about a year. And then I'll go back to Korea. Nowadays I am enjoying cooking food. The grocery is not far from my apartment. So I usually go to the grocery and buy some ingredients. I'm trying to make pancakes this week. But it's too hard for me to make it delicious.
