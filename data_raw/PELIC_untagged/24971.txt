The two texts exhibit two opposites of points of view about the situation of English language. I think I found the most convining in the test De throned . Because the author enunciates that English can be dethroned by listing some organizations of other languages such as Arab League International Organization of French speaking Countries Association of Portuguese speaking and so on to indicate that all these non English speaking countries are acting to protect their language. The author also cites the fact that each language has own geographical sphere by giving the examples of the constitutional languages of India the languages of the Russian nationalities etc. Moreover there are 100 national languages that are taught and used in schools. Even though in the world English has still been the most important language and has had a situation of monopoly the in communication many countries have acknowledged the language issue such as linguicide ethnocide deculturation and so on. All these can have a effect De throned on English.
