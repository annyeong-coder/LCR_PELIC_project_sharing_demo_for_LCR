Many people say that sports are overemphasized in our culture. My opinion is that the advantages of sports outweigh it's disavantages. I believe that sports provide opportunities to people who don't have many other opportunities. Consider that the inner city boy for example whoes parents can't afford to send him to college even though he's a good student. One of my best friends fell into this catagory. He waited until the football team pittsburgh steelers joined him. He will practice with the steelers when he ariivesto pittsburgh. Steelers arereally big in pittsburgh. While pittsburgh lost previouse games my friend played with them eventhough he played really good and put all his effort they still lost those games. Finally he succeeded in playing for the steelers eventhoug he didn't get education like the other players.
