I agree that the opinions expressed in the text. And I strongly believe that a company cannot be allowed to freely choose its social responsibility. Let me explain why I insist on my statement. A corporation or a company is a form of business organization. Its purpose is to create the maximum benefits or advantages. If companies can choose their social responsibility they will choose one that is the maximum profit for them. No matter this social responsibility is benefit for civilian or not. For example Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company TSMC donated money to National Taiwan University to assist in building a new learning building. TSMC not only have a good reputation but it also can get tax relief. A Company always choose advantage to do social responsibility. But if there is a conflict between the company purpose and the social responsibility what is the answer Especially in this text corporations cause a tremendous damage to the environment and other elements of the public interest. I think the answer is markable. So I agree that legislatures have to pass special laws that focus on this issue to control companies behaviors. Let social responsibilities make their rules their rules of the games. Under this situation social responsibility should be considered by companies. Something can be freely chosen by companies but something cannot especially involving of public profits.
