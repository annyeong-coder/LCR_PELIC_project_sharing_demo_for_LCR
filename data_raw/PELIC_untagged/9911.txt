Hi I'm Kyung Jong Last Name . I wanted to drop by and introduce you to my first blog. I have been recently starting this blog about my interesting field. Now I am currently studying English at the ELI which provides me with English skills for Academic Studies. When I arrived in Pittsburgh five months ago I was fluent in only two words which were 'ok' and 'thanks' in English. I was inappropriately dressed and culturally inept. Through hard work and determination I have excelled academically and I have initiated extracurricular involvement as I have overcome the language barrier. By the time I came here I have worked for a construction company for various engineering services related to the scheduling and planning of projects analyzing integrated schedules for construction and monitoring project costs and schedules in coordination with budget and building code. The reason why I became a civil engineer is because of one event. In 1994 the Sung Su Bridge in Korea collapsed. Thirty people were killed and twenty more were injured. This event inspired me to become a civil engineer. The collapse of the Sung Su Bridge was the result of fatigue cracks that grew in size. This accident caused enormous amounts of damage to human life and to property and it inspired me to pursue professional qualification as a civil engineer to learn about safety techniques for structures. When I was a child moreover my father used to bring me photographs of the world's bridges and books concerning mechanics and construction management. This sparked my interest in civil engineering. When I grew older I wanted to understand not only how structures were designed and built but also how mechanics functioned to prevent structures from collapsing. I want to continue changing refining the ways in which I approach civil engineering.
