ANON_NAME_0 Barasheed Feb. 16. 2012 Description of beach Sitting in the beach is really captivating what a wonderful day when I watched the waves hitting the beach leaving shells behind while children building a castle of sands. I really enjoy watching the blue sky while birds gull flaying and musicians playing. I apply some oil to my body to get a tan then I participated in the volleyball when my other friends BBQ the seafood it is smell really good. I am feeling warm I wish to eat ice cream but I am hanger so I will eat seafood first with lemonade juice then I will have ice cream for dessert. Waking in the sand bare foot is really relaxing. My friends want me to I join them in wind surfing but I preferred to hang out with my dog.
