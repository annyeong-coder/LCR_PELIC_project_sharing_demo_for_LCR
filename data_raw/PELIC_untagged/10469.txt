This weekend was normal like another weekend but had more activities. First of all on Friday I attend school early what it makes Bob happy because I was on time for his class. I attend most classes except the last one it was listening because I was participating with some of my Saudi brother's help them to organize the Saudi open house. I was help them till 4 00 clock then I left to my apartment to get ready for work. Actually I miss the Saudi open house but I didn't regret about that because I cooperated with them to finish preparing for it. I started at work at 5 00 clock till 3 00 at morning. I went home and I watched the 3rd part of THE GODFATHER and I went to sleep after that. Next day I wok up at 10 00 clock at morning like always. I had along day working till 3 oo am. Because I didn't sleep good for two days I was late for work on Sunday. In addition I spouse to start work at 11. 00 Clock something wrong happen maybe my alarm it didn't goes off or I was tired and I ignore the alarm. Anyway I started work late at 1. 00 Clock I worked till 5 00 afternoon.
