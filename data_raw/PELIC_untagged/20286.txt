I remember this experience and emotion well still now. I was 4 or 5 years old when I started to write words and I liked creating a short story. I liked imagining stories of fantasy. However one day my parents found the writing. Then they asked me what I wrote and said comments most of which were compliments about my writing. I felt very shy and uncomfortable to hear their concern about my writing. After that I became reluctant to be found what I wrote by my parents and stopped generating stories. I cannot explain why felt in that way. Maybe I felt some anticipation of my writing or surveillance from parents in retrospect. I think it was the very an example of creativity killers and my inherent ability of creating new story was inhibited. If there was no psychological pressure I could have enhanced my ability of writing. I missed a chance to be an author of a best seller.
