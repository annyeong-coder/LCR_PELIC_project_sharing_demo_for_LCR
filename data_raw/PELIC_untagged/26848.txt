I like animal movies. For exemple Marley and Me G. Force and Alvin and the Chipmunks. Alvin and the Chipmunks one of which I've seen is my favorit movie. This is the movie which has a simple story line but I can get strong impression and fun. Also I can enjoy the many genre of music which are very popular. Jason ANON_NAME_0 is a leading actor playing the song writer. In this movie we can see how three chipmunk brothers and song writer could be a family which based on love.
