21 Is the most excited age in the United States for the majority of young people and it is neither the age for driving nor for being in collage. In addition it's not even the age for being the president. But it is important age because it is the time when anyone can drink alcohol. What are alcohol beverages to be restricted by age limit They are divided into three general categories which are beers wines and spirits. Small amount of them might not be a problem but when people drink more than a cup or two they will lose control on themself. Alcohol beverages are significant in the social events in the U. S. Because it release stress by reducing attention and slow the body action. The law in the U. S prevents people under 21 from drinking because it believe that everyone below that age react differently to alcohol for example they are unable to control the amount of the drink so they become drunk faster. Despite the fact that many people think it is safer to keep young people under 21 away from alcohol beverages I totally disagree with them for three reasons which are many countries considered the limit age for drinking is 18 people in the U. S can vote for the president when they are 18 and being unable to drink while other can do.
