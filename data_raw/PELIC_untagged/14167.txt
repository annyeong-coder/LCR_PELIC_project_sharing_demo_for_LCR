I think the ELI is a good choice for students who want to study English as a foreign language. First there are many options and events that we can enjoy using English. As you know from the graph the number of events has increased every semester since fall in 2007. I think we can study things for English skill more than other schools commented Gajin ANON_NAME_0 who studied the ELI last semester. Moreover we have many teachers who assist our improvement. Also in order to the graph 14. 67 Percent of students take only one couse. It means it worth to take even only one course. I think the ELI gives us not only English skills but also good experience.
