It is hard to decide the best meal experience I have ever had because my mother is a good cooker. I think I am a very lucky daughter. My mother can make various Chinese dishes dumplings noodles roast chicken or meat pies. When I was a little girl I was living with my grandparents in a small village. My grandma is a good cooker too. Since I am the youngest grandchild every family member took care of me at that time. I still remembered that I told my grandpa I liked to eat the pigeon's brain. I was so little that I did not understand that my grandpa liked his pigeons so much. However I would not talk this with my grandpa if I knew that he asked my grandma to cook all his pigeons after that. I ate 12 pigeon brains at one meal. I did not see my grandpa to raise any pigeon after that. I think that meal is the worst meal experience I have ever had.
