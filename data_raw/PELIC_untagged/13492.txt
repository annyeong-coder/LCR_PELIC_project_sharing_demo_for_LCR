The space is the mystery that many people hope to discover and to know if there another life instead of us. So one of those people is me. If anyone has a chance to go to vacation in the space he she will prepare himself to deal with any situation that he she will be there. He she will train to move into place with zero gravity no food like in the earth changeable in sleeping schedule etc. I think they will discover another life with stranger people or alien with quite different look and different language. I think sometimes they will deal with dangerous situation during their trip. For that they should have a weapon to protect them self against any dangerous situation. Maybe they will see different scenery such as trees rocks and mountains. Also they will take many samples to make an experiment on them when they return back to their home. Finally they will feel kind of scary and excitement because they haven't any idea about the other life there thus the person who wants to going to this place must be a brave and has a capable to do things that the other people can't. This is my imagination in brief maybe it will be true or just kind of vision.
