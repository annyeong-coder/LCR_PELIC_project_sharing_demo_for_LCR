Hi Gina The last months were busy and tired but everything lay on. I fixed up my new apartment that was a big problem Not having a car is so strange I have to rent one every time when I need to pick up new things. I really miss my car now and all the furniture here is disassemble. I had to put all the pieces together which took me double the time but all the effort paid off because I did my apartment up. I love it now. My days are completely full I wake up at 7 30 am in the morning you know I need to run to start my day. I try to run for 1 hour after that I go back to home them I check my email I read some on line newspapers from Chile looking news up of public policies. I get on the bus at 9 30 because my classes start at 10 AM. Mondays and Thursdays are the worst days because I spent all my day at the University I don't go back to my house until 7 30 PM. Tuesdays and Fridays are better because I go back to home at 4 00. Wednesdays are my free day but they aren't really free. I spend all day cleaning up putting stuff back throwing garbage out and buying groceries. I'm so tired I really need someone to help me out with all the work in the apartment. Where were you last Monday I call you up but nobody answered me. You have to call me back soon I have great news for you. Anyway see you soon I'm waiting for you visit. Kathy
