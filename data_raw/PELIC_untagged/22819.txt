My room my world in the U. S. So I'm cheer up when I set down in my room. Usually when I be there I take off my jacket and I write my homework down. I pick out all furniture from Ikea. Sometimes I fill out some forms and I go along with my room. Sometimes I keep on my room about three a hours. When I want to sleep I turn phone off.
