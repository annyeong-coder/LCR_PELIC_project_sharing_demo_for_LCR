One of the key persons in my life was my grandmother. She passed away a few years ago but she helped me a lot when I was in school. She always taught me math I like her way in teaching. I would be bad in math but for her I did very well. She always lends me money when I don't have any. Really I would be in very bad financial situation but for her support I am always good. I wish she still alive to help me. I wish I could stay with her for a monument but I couldn't. I wish my eyes wouldn't get moist when I remember her. Had I known she was ill I would have done something to help her. In her last years she was in a bad financial situation but she didn't told me. Had I known she was in a bad financial situation I wouldn't lend money from her. I wish the old days would come back to help her. I wish she didn't passed way to she me when I graduated for university.
