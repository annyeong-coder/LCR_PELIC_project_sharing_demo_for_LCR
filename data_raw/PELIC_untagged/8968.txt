Since the last order boom in 2005 Boeing tried to increase its pace in delivering the aircrafts. According to the data we can see that in 2000 Boeing was almost successful in meeting the demand. Between 2001 2003 there was a steady decrease in the number of aircraft deliveries. We can interpret the data to mean that the difference between the orders and the deliveries in these years were likely to be caused by the previous orders. In 2004 all the orders were delivered. But in 2005 there was a drastic increase in the number of orders and the company was not able to respond to this increase. The largest number of orders was in 2006. The graph indicates that there was a drastic decrease in the number of orders in 2007. Boeing is trying to deliver the orders of 2005 2006 and 2007 by increasing the number of deliveries steadily.
