I would like to talk about a situation for which I received the most encouragement. That was in 1997 in my first year of BA. I was the top student in the class in the English department which by that time had been launched for tow years. In other words I was in the first year of a two patch department. It was a trend to read in the English department that time. I still remember how Dr Tamimi an Iraqi professor admired my English. He encouraged us all the time. He helped me a lot. I remember that once he convinced the teacher of psychology to add me some marks in order to pass the subject I was about to fail and which I disliked the whole course. Dr Tamimi once said to the other class the second year students if I have influence I will open a third year class for ANON_NAME_0! That would never happen under any circumstances but he was fostering my tendency toward the language. I have been engrossed with the course of phonetics he taught us. In the following year I felt enthusiastic to teach as he instilled my confidence in teaching. I really seek to make him credit and for me to encourage someone does not mean that your biased in favour of them.
