Graduation is next month!I need to make some plans now because when exams start I don t have any free time. What am I going to do when I finish school My roommate is going to take a vacations before she look for a job. I can t do that because I need to earn some money soon. I think that when I ll graduate I am going to take a word processing class. As soon as I learn word processing I ll look for a job as a bilingual office assistant. It s hard to find full time jobs though. Part time jobs are easier to find. Maybe I ll take a part time job when I find a good full time one. Or maybe I ll take a workshop in making decisions before I do anything.
