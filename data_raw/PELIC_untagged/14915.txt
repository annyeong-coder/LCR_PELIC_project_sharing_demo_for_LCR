I was born in Jeddah. I grew up in it. I was a calm girl. I have my uncle in UAE. So we've visited him alot. I had a great time in Dubai with my cousins. We played together all the time. But five years ago I lost three of them in car's accidents . It was hard time for our families. I never forget them. I've tried to make my thinking away as I can. In addition before three years I lost even my father. We've hurt many times. I've asked our God to help us.
