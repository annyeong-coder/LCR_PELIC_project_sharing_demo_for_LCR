The author mentions that surveillance and watching the kids make their creative urge goes underground and hides. I think sometimes it's important to watch them because they may feel better and say to them that their work is amazing they would continue to work very well. Also the author mentions that putting kids in a desperate win lose situation this is might be a serous problem for kids because other kids would feel depressed which might kill their creativity rather then make it grow more. It has affect on the majority which might consider it unfair sometimes. Finally the author mentions that make the parents choose which activity supposed their children might lead to the creativity killers or kill the creativity because children know what they like by their feelings and nobody can control their feelings so we have to make them choose the activity that they want and support them.
