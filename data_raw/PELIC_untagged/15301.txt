The first month in Pittsburgh was very dificult. For one reason it was the first time that I travelled out of my country. Second I did not have enough experience. First of all I did not use to the cold weather and I did not have enough money to buy clothes. Most importantly I changed my housing three times because I lived in bad appartment and bad area. Another proplem I did not know how to use the public transportation and and I always loss my way. Most of the time I was hungry because I did not konw where is resturant located. The next month was different. I got use to live in this city and I found it very nice and not exepensive. In addition to this Pittsburgh is one of the best residential areas. Finally Pittsburgh is good safe andgeat city and I liked it.
