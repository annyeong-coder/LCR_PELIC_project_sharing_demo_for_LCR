I have read the quote by Diane Arbus. I think it means she likes to travel in different places where she has never seen before. I feel the same way with her because it is boring if you have just traveled the same place many times. I have been to dive in the South of Thailand. I would like to go to the Niagara Falls because I have never been there yet.
