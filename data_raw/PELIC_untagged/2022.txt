From my childhood my dream was to be a doctor. After I graduated from high school I was thinking to enter school of medicine. I heard that school would be difficult but it was not. Also some people told me that wouldn't be able to pass the exams from the first time but it was not. These information have challenged me. It made barrier in front of my goal but I have accepted the challenges to achieve my dream. I remembered my father's saying when he told me that you would be able to reach you goal if don't listen to the people. I have studied for 7 year from school of medicine. I have past all courses from the first time with reasonable grades and fulfilled my dream
