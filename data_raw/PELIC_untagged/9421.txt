Writing 4 Kayoko Ueda Jan 29 2008 New York is good place to study English New York sounds like a great place to study English because there are many kinds of foreigners. Of course other cities also have many foreigners. But I think that New York has most kinds of foreigners in the world. I think that many non native speakers study English at the kind of English school in New York. If I go to the English school I can make many friends there. When I talk with my friends I have to speak English. Additionally I like to go shopping and eat at various restaurants with my friends. New York has many kinds of stores and restaurants. So I have to use English in order to enjoy my life. I think that it would be the trigger that my English skills are improved dramatically.
