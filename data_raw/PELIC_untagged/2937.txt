I do many things befor I start to write. For example I found a clean place in my room because my room is also messy. Then I make favorite coffe. I turn off the music or the TV because I like studying with out noisy. I make a plan in my mind then I pick the examples to siport my topic and start writing. But sometime I change my ideas. My most important learning style is visual. For in stnce I watch TV and lusing to the radio befor I watch TV I dress begam I feel ckmfrtbal. Finaly is too very defront to leran English for my but I must work hard.
