When I was working in Japan I had to develop the vaccine for leprosy. My boss had gotten the funding from Japanese healthcare department regarding such research project. He always encouraged me to work hard because he also needed the data to get the funding continuously. However my coworkers were opposite. They said that your project is non sense because leprosy is already degraded and nobody needs the vaccine for leprosy. In fact my opinion was same with my coworkers. While I was working I always felt so bad because I had to do the things that I believed were not worth. Finally I gave up continuing the job. Now I think that I should have communicated with my boss to make clear the meaning of that project. Also I ought to have told to my boss what I'm thinking of that project and I should have changed the project as soon as possible.
