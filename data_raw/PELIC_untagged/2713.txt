When I went back home four months ago I was completely afraid about what I was going to see there because I was stayed in America for seven months and no one sent me any news about my country or my family. So I was thinking about my family and how they are doing and is something has changed there or not. All these thought was in my mind when I was in the plane until the captain announced that we are reaching the airport of my country. My heart was beating so strongly. However I think this is the first time for me to be far away from my family and my country. After that I was trying to calm down and to get used with this condition. So when I reached the airport I was sure no one knows that I'll be here at that day. When I finished from bag check I went through security to get out of the airport terminal but before I reached the exit gate I heard someone calling me and then I surprised for what I saw there. It was all my family and without any notice from me I cried with my mother and my sisters because I did not talk to them for long time. Then I have asked how they know that I will be in this day. After that I asked my brother and he told me that his friend who was in the same institute with me studying told him that I was coming at this day. I was a little angry about that and I told to my self I should insult him for what he did then realize that not fair because my family was missing me so much.
