Today I am going to tell about my best meal I have ever eaten. Definitely it was here in the United States. I love meat especially Steak. Therefore I went to Ruth's ANON_NAME_0 Steak house. I ordered a Filet Mignon medium well and as a side I ordered mashed potatos and spinach. As an appetizer I ordered a Caesar Salad just a normal one without chicken on it and as a dressing I ordered just Italian dressing no typical Caesar Salad dressing. When I got my Steak and ate the first bite the meat was melting on my tongue like butter. The meat was so soft and smoothly to eat. The secret of Ruth's ANON_NAME_0 Steak house is that they serve the meat on a hot plate which is still frying while it is served. The mashed potatos were served with a small slice of butter on the top and the spinach was refined with garlic and a little cream. For dessert I ordered a hot chocolate cake with a scoop of strawberry ice cream. For decoration they put some fresh strawberries cut in thin slices and a slice of kiwi. On top of the chocolate cake there was a mint leaf.
