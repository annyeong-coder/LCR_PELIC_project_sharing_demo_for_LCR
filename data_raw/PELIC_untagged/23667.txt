I regret the fact that I was taking swimming lessons as a child and the instructors told my mother that I would be a great addition to the swim team but I turned it down because I was extremely shy and afraid of being in competitions. I always wondered what would have happened if I had tried it. I was a really fast swimmer and I think I really would have enjoyed it.
