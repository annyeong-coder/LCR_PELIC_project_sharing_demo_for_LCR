I have been living in a small apartment for eight months. It's bad place to grow up my children in it . Also I don't like to keep on in this apartment . I will give up this apartment and I'd like to pick out a pig one. I'd like to cheer my family up . Now I'm looking up for it. If I find one I'd clean up its carpet or take away the old one and take a new one. I will hang up some pictures in the dining room and I will buy new furniture and throw away the old one. So I will but up the sofa in the dining room. In conclusion I'd like to live through by my life with my family.
