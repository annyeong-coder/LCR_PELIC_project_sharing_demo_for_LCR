I agree with friends are the most important influence on young adults. Friends are the most closest people except parents and most of the young adults will tell their deepest secrets to their friends. When children are not at the age to go to school they stay with their parents every day. At this time parents influence their children the most. But it just for five to six years. After children go to school they spend most of their time with their friends. From the moment they go to school parents can not control their children. In Taiwan students spend nine hours at school. After school they might go to cram school with their friends and it costs three hours the most. They only get one or two hours at home with their parents. If their friends are hard working students they can learn a lot from them. But if they are students who just think about playing even they are at cram school they still cannot learn anything. What friends do young adults will follow. When they come to the age of to go to work the friends in their workplace also will influence them the most. Because they work together they spend all of their time at a place or even after work or on weekends. They will learn each other's habits. But this time they can make decisions by themselves. They will know what can learn which should not follow. Because of young adults spend most of their time at school and at work place the people they get in touch with the most are their friends so friends influence them the most.
