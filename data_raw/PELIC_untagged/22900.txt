There is many places around the world I like stay visit it when I have vacation. The best place for me is Sharm El Sheikh it is nice place In northeast Egypt. There are tourists visit it throughout the year. I feel comfortable when I visit it because it is quit place and there are many hotels around the sea . My favorite's hobby is divining and I can practice my hobby there because it is located close to read sea . There is something I like it in this city are the voice of birds . If I hear it every morning when I eat my breakfast I Consort with the voices and give me The promise of life . The special place in the city is Naama Bay street it is in the middle of the city . Usually I go to the street in the night because there are many restraints and coffee shop . The most beautiful in the street is no car in the street just the people walk. When you walk in the this street you will be smell the smell of Hoka and coffee. Sharm el Sheikh deserve to be the most attractive place for tourists.
