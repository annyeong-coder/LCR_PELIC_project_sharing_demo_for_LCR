While I was going home today I saw the accident. When the accident Happened the driver was turning left by red light. He wasn't paying attention. While he was driving he was listening to his car radio. When he saw another Car he immediately stepped on the brakes but it's too late. Another driver Wasn't paying attention either. He wasn't stopping at the stop sign. Then the Police arrived they solve the accident very quickly. The driver will be ok No one hurt it's a good news.
