I met my husband in Russia where he was staying in order to practice Russian. I was studying French when my teacher offered me to host in my family one of the French students who would come to our city to study Russian. I was so exited! While I was studying French dreamed about meeting some French speaking people for practicing and improving my skills. I never thought that this meeting could change my whole life. My husband did not stay in my family instead it was a girl named Isabelle. However almost every day Russian and French students had party and spent time altogether. One day while we were walking in downtown I saw ANON_NAME_0 for the first time. I remember he was carrying a very big Russian dictionary. When we spoke together we realized that we have many interests in common. Soon we became friends. He was teaching me salsa dancing. We went out to a lot of dance club together. When ANON_NAME_0 had to leave he promised me to comeback to Russia. We were calling each other every day and waiting for a new meeting. After eight month when ANON_NAME_0 was visiting me for the third time he asked me to marry him. And seven month later we got married.
