I think I am a judger. I will be going to Austin in the spring break. Before going there I will make sure that I have everything arranged. I will buy a ticket on line that has a special price. I will also book a hotel room that is closest to the airport. Austin International airport which I choose to land in. This airport was the place where I met my first American friend. My friend whose house is at Austin will be meeting me at the airport.
