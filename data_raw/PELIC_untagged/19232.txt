In my country we do not tip. That's why when I came to the States in 2004 I was not usud to it at the begining. There was once I brought my son to a Chinese restaurant at Hershey. We were the only customers and the waitress was a pretty young girl. She was smiling at us the whole time when we were eating so we enjoyed the dinner there. When I went to the front desk to check out she waited until I signed the slip and pointed out I supposed to pay tips at least 15 of the dinner fees. I felt embrassed and her face turned into green. I grabed my son's hand and ran out of the door.
