I will put three things in a time capsule to give future generations clues about what life is like today. First I will put my diary in it because I can write about my life. Second I choose photos the photos can show people how I wear and look. Photos also will show the environment. Finally I will put newspapers because they contain a lot of information about our world. All in all I think these three item will to give future generations clues about what life is look today.
