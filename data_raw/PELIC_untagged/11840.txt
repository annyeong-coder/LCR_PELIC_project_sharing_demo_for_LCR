My favorite place to eat lunch in Pittsburgh is Cathedral of Learning C. L building for several reasons. First of all I can have lunch which I brought from my house at the C. L. I always prepare 2 lunch box for me and my husband. I'm a student which means I don't have enough money. It costs a lot of money to live in the United States as a student. So I'm trying to save money as possible. There are many people who bring there lunch at C. L. So I can enjoy my lunch with comfortable. Moreover I can save my time through having lunch at C. L. I'm studying English at the same building now. I don't need to go to far. And I have a lot of assignments to do. If I have lunch at the C. L I can do my homeworks in the rest of time. Finally C. L is very warm inside. The weather of Pittsburgh is very cold lately. I'm very week in the cold weather. Besides I didn't bring my winter clothes when I came to the Pittsburgh. So I don't want to go outside when the weather is cold. For these reasons the place that I most like to have lunch in Pittsburgh is Cathedral of Learning Building.
