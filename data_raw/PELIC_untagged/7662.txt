In my opinion 'Can English be dethroned' is more subjective and passionate than 'Winners and losers' and 'Winners and losers' is more objective and analytial than 'Can English be dethroned. ' I can say 'Winners and losers' is objective and analytical because it consults several datas such as a graph. 'Can English be dethroned' has no special data and it used not a few emotional words like linguicide Language and so on.
