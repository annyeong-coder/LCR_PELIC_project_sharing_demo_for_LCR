When two similar options come to people it's hard to decide what they choose. It's the same for me. If there is only one thing I can buy between a piece of jewelry or tickets to an event that I really want to attend I will probably choose a ticket. It would be different the pursuit of each person. Some people like jewelry and that kind of stuffs and some people like doing something worth which they think it is for them. I'm one of the latter group. I prefer things I can want to do. And when I have enough money I can buy a piece of jewelry I want to get next time. There are a lot of jewelry stores around me and I can see them even in the some store whose main products are usually clothes like pants or shirts. But the event doesn't always come to me. It would get a chance to go to the event only once in my life time. Foreign musician's concert is the one of examples I can show. Most famous musicians have a concert and sometimes they come to other cities for their fans from aboard. It's a chance to see them in person even though I can meet them personally. If I lose this time I have to wait for them until they come here again or I might not see them anymore in real. So buying tickets to an event is much better for me than buying a piece of jewelry. Because I don't want to regret my choice and to lose a good timing when the chance comes to me I think it's more worth to do what I will do.
