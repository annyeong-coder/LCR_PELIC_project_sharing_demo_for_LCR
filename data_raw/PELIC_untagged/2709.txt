My father had a difficult life. He grew up with his father after his mother died. They lived in a small town. My grandfather was a farmer and my father could help him before he went to school. My father wasn't able to continue his education. In 1968 he was able to apply in Saudi Army. He was 18 years old. When he turned 25 he was able to return to school again. He was working in the morning and studying at night. Although the school was very far away he could go to school everyday. He was able to get high school diploma. He couldn't stay with his family every time. He could send some money to my grandfather to help him working in the farm
