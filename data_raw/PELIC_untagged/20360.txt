If I was going to be shipwrecked near a deserted tropical island. I will take a lot of pastas enough fresh water a watch many maps and a lot chocolate. The chocolates and pastas can give energy for my body. The energy is very important for my body. Many people had dead in the woods because their body lost water and energy. So the fresh water has important. I am going to take enough water. A watch can help me know the time. In the woods the time has important. And sometime the watch can do compass. These maps can know where am I.
