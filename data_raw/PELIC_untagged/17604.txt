15 Years ago I was on a blind date for the first time in my life. What makes the day memorable is the fact that the date is now my husband. I was wondering whom I was going to be introduced to but I had never imagined that he was whom I was going to marry. The person who had set up the blind date was my friend's sister who were going to school with my husband. The restaurant where we were supposed to meet was closed. My huband who is always functual as the clock arrived before me and left a memo saying he would be at the restaurant across the street. I sill remember what he was wearing that day. I can't believe that it's been already 15 years since I met him for the first time.
