I enjoy travelling and visiting natural and historical places. Last year I have been to The Black Sea Region in Turkey. This region has an interesting and beatiful natural environment. I took a lot of photographs. The Black Sea Region is famous for linking green and blue in Turkey. Everything on land is green and Black Sea is actual blue. You can watch all blue and green shades there. Hazelnut gardens on land and small sailing boats on the sea harmonize perfectly green and blue. Trabzon a city in the Black Sea Region is full of historical places. For instance charming Sumela Manaster and impressive constructions were built there. Besides other many historical buildings and places are there. In conclusin with having natural and historical places The Black Sea Region is worth of visiting.
