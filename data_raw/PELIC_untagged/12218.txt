I have always been able to move objects by my mind. My parents had been suspicioused about the way that I act in home by that time till they figured out my superpower. One day my father came and sat next to me when I was watching a movie on TV. My dad wanted to change the channel but the movie had not finished yet. Before he had picked up the remote control I moved it from its place. He had been staring at me for one minute approximately. Then I admitted to him that I have the ability of moving objects. Since that day my parents have become proud of me.
