The love of money is the root of all evil. Is a Biblical phrase. I agree the phrase. Because I experienced that. When I was a University student. I found a wallet on the street. The wallet had a lot of money. I decided that I spend the money. I drunk wine by the money. Suddenly I heard a voice from God. He said What are you doing now So I feared and I was heart ache. There are none but fear God. It was not till then that I knew the fact Heaven will punish you for an avarice of money. Many people believe that money talks. But! It is not truth. I think that money buy something but no amount of money can buy happiness. I knew from the experience. If you want a lot of money. Well you should earn an honest penny. Thank you.
