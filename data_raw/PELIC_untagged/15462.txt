Misurata where I born and grew up is quit big city on the coast of Mediterranean sea in Libya. I was born in my grand father's house which was very big house with many rooms but when I was seven we moved to the house I grew up in. This house where my parents still live is in a quit region. To me this was the best place in the world. My father had a big garden where we played in. My elementary school which was small was near our house. After school I always went straight to my room where I lived with my young brother in. Near to my room was our huge kitchen which was the place where my mother cooked every day in. Next to the kitchen there were two small rooms for my sisters. The late my grandmother who stayed with us usually was really very kind and she told us a lot of stories which was wonderful.
