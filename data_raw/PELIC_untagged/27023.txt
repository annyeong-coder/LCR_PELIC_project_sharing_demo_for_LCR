First my hobby is dancing a salsa. I'd like to dance Salsa. I learned how to dance a salsa in my friend's birthday party. It was amazing! From that time I have been dancing on every saturday. When I have been dancing I can feel that my soul flow in my body. It makes me feel good. Also dancing salsa at the club can make many friends. Then I have been meeting them who like salsa. They teach me how to dance well and make me fun. Second hobby is making a accessories by myself. I have made earring and necklace by myself. I had been bought some stuffs for making accessories and made it. It is hard to me but I have been feeling fun and fun. Third hobby is traveling. I'd like to plan to travel. And I have been Europe Australia and many Asian countries. The best place where I had been is Australia. They have been protecting their nature. So I had seen many wild birds on the street. Even Kangaroos were running on the street. It was amazing! These are my hobbies and what I like.
