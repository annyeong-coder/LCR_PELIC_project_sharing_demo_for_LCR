When I was 18 years old I went the North of Korea with my highscool friends. This was a highscool excursion. We stayed about 4 days at the North of Korea. We saw much scenery. First we climbed the Mt. Kumkang. We watched sentence to write red letter on rock. This was about to show respect to the North the Korea president. We were little scared. Then we saw the show that called the 'Moranbong'. This show was surfrised me. Many people cried because they sang a song the ' We wish the unity'. The song means unity of Korea and everybody the South of Korea and the North of Korea know it. I wish I went to the North of Korea again.
