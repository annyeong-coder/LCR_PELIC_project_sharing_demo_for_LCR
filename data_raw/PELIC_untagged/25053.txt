In the first article which is Can English be dethroned . A Geolinguist professor discusses the predominance of English in the world. However in the second article English seen as Co Star among global languages disputes this argument. This argument is divided into three areas which are English widely used languages and minorities languages. The Geolinguist professor in first article points out that English has become the dominant language in the world and taken place in many aspects such as diplomacy relations economy and military. On the other hand Randolph has a cast doubt on that point. He quotes from British analyst that English will not retain its position as dominant in the worldwide but it will be one of the most important languages though. And it is still one of the important languages in science magazine. The Geolinguist claims that English will eliminate widely used languages languages like national languages in Russia and Arabia or India because He acknowledges that the perfect method to dispose of these languages is to teach another language. Randolph thinks that Chinese people will be soon in enthronement and the number of English native speakers will decrease in 2050. Eventually in my opinion I personally agree with the idea that English is the dominant because of some compelling reasons. Nowadays our country which has Arabic language has to deal with other countries by English and the country has acknowledged that English is second language in our country. Likewise they have imposed students to learn this language in order to have a good position among these countries
