Next summer I will go back to my country. There it is going to be winter. In my country the winter is going to be very hot. If I want I will go to the beach and I am going to be bronze. The city will be very empty because everybody is going to travel. Today I miss my country. I can't imagine in April. I will miss a lot!!
