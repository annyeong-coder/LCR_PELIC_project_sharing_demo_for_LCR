Population of today s world is seven billion. Each of peoples is located different lands or places. In fact although many different lands exist there is just one air which covers the world. However it is known that fact every single person keeps polluting the air conciously or unconsciously. According to me the main cause of increasing air pollution is exhaust gases. Because of incredible growth of high technology production of vehicle has gone up in a very short time. For this reason usage of energy resources and waste of energy resources has increased day by day. If we don t take some precaution to prevent the air pollution next generation is going to encounter several dieseas.
