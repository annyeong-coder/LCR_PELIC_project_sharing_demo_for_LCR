There are many decisions people are taking and in the future they regret taking them. In my case the word if is not a big trend in my life but after my coming to the United States of America and because of the obstacles I have faced in being accepted in American dental school I said if I had studied another major I would have been accepted easier. If getting the acceptance is not a problem here I would be happy. Some people trying to cheer me up and I am always telling them if I just had had acceptance I would not be so depressed. My life is not bad without this acceptance because I have already started a good independent life and in one year I made a huge success. However seeing the high American dentsits' education and their salaries making me sometimes saying if only I came to the united states just after my high school. Despite these regrets I believe that I did my best and that makes me sustain the idea of being unaccepted. Actually we have saying in Arabic that means the word if brings the devil to work. Finally if our teacher Rebeca had not given as this assignment I would not have said these things to any other people. That is all what I could write.
