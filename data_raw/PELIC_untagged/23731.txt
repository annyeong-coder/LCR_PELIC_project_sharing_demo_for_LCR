My exeperence is you Can find a variety types of food because of the multiplicity of nationalities so you can try Mexican food Japanese food Italian food Indian food and Mediterranean food. I do not think that Americans can not cook but they can not cook every day because of their busy life. I know many American who cook every weekend. So they just need to reheat and eat.
