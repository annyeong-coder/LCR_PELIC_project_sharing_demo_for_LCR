I love my parents from I was born until now they give me too much they love me this kind of love is nature and obviously . From I was a baby I can't eat food or drink water by my self they teach me and help me . Now I am a big girl I can do anything by my self I can cook dinner for my father I can wash clothes for my mother I can earn money by my self . I think my father and my mother very proud of me . But I know I am a baby in there heart forever ! I wish when I find a job I can make a lot of money I will use these money buy a lot of beautiful clothes for my mom and I will buy a big car for my father . In this world there is another person I love him same with myself .
