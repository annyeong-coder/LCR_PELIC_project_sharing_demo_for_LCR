I would like to have smell and sight hooked together. It means whenever I saw something I would smell something else so these two things would come to mind simultaneously. In other words When I saw something my smell would be activated. For example if someone watches a wedding party on TV he will smell a certain kind of perfume. In this case that scene will stir up some fragrances smelled in the past.
