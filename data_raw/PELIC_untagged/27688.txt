One day I was waiting for my conversation partner in the university campus but I did not know where we will meet exactly so I called her. When she picked the phone up I told her that I am near a big tree. She did not know where I am standing so she kept on asking me about what I am seeing around me. She did not know and I gave up describing the place. Finally we figured it out that we will meet near the Carnegie museum dinosaur. When I arrived there I turned around and I saw her.
