Do you know what Formosa means Portuguese came up with this magnificent name for Taiwan when they saw the island of Taiwan for the first time in their ship from the Pacific Ocean. It means How beautiful beautiful island! Well this is where I came from. Before I came to the United States I have already studied a traditional Chinese instrument Pi Pa for 20 years. Also I have been a Pi Pa teacher and professional player after I graduated from university for 2 years. And then I found a job as a social activities coordinator in the Public Relations Department of the Taipei city government. I planned and executed large scale arts festival cases until I came to the United States to studied English. You can click on my photo to see my concert and activities pictures. I have been living and studying English in Pittsburgh for 1 year and I like Pittsburgh very much. I hope that I can improve English very fast.
