My apartment is very messy because all my roommates don't care about their room's weather inside it or outside it. It's like garbage with a lot of trash in it and around it. They keep avoid cleaning their rooms all the time except me I never leave my stuff without I take it to what belongs. However I've tried talking to them to clean every thing up. When you entered their rooms you will see their books every where on the floor and you will see tissues on the ground too. It's like pieces of broken glass thrown every where on the ground. Moreover their beds aren't tidy and when you come close to it you will smell something weird though. In the hall you will see their shoes not placed on the right place they just throw it away. In addition sometimes you will see their shoes at dining room. Every thing in the dining room is missed up because no one take his stuff back when he done with it. They just leave it away until someone else comes and take it if he didn't find anything instead.
