In this year food costs have risen 4. 4 Higher than previous year. It is obvious that the cause is due to the jump in gas prices because most of our food's prices include transport charges. But we don't need to be pessimistic about this situation. Americans don't spend much money to their meals and the ratio between income and costs for meals Engel's law is low. The reason of this is that not only America is rich country but also they don't have to spend their money for foods because of the cheep and convenient food with high calories and low nutrients such as cone derived snacks which the subsidizing continuing after Depression makes it possible to produce at low cost. But behind of these low costs there are two social problems. One is environmental damage and another which is most obvious is obesity due to taking excessive calories. More than half of the Americans are overweight and 94 billion is spend to treat the diseases related to overweight. Certainly natural foods such as fruits and vegetable are expensive and have fewer calories compared with convenient food. But they have much more nutrients which we really need and give us more satisfaction with low calories. Very now when the food costs is rising we should know the real worth of the food that is not dollar par calorie but is dollar par nutrient .
