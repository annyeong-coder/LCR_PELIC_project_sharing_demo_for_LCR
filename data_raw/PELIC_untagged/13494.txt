After International Space Station took place in its orbit around the Earth one of the suggestions of using it was to make this space laboratory as a station for space tourist. In other word was to launch a new kind of tourist projects to new destination. The space trips will be too expensive they are going to cost some millions per person so rich people only are going to be able to travel to space at least for first few years of starting such projects. Let us dream that one day will have a chance to visit ISS we will take a space vehicle with very high speed before it will land and stuck on ISS. On that site we will live in a dark sky between stars we will see how scientists work in space we will float inside this lab where no gravity and we will eat some special and strange food. The visitors to ISS will swim in feelings of dangerous as the dark will surround them they will ask themselves if they are going to see our plant again. They will be real witnesses on the advanced technologies that allow people to go far away from the Earth and then come back. I had read about ISS and since that I started imagine how people will live in such unknown place for months. It is going to be awesome trip so it will be good to send rich people first.
