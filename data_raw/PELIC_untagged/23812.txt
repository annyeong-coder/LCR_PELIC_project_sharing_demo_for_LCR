A country must be prepared to fight a war or just defend the territory from the enemies. In a world with many political economical and religious problems all countries should try to avoid of a war but it is inevitable. For example unfortunately just a few countries in the world have oil and it is necessary to use every day for countries to develop in general. This situation brings as consequence that many powerful countries try to impose their power through of a war. It is a complex situation where is required thousands and thousands of militaries in both side as much the country that has oil as the country that wants invade. Another problem refers about religion it is common in the Middle East. Some frontiers in this part of world are in constantly war for their different religions and they need a considerable amount of militaries to keep safety the border. When countries are preparing for a war or defend the territory the most important feature is their human capital it means militaries that must be prepared correctly to do a good job. Military service must be considered as a kind of job such as medicine marketing or lawyers.
