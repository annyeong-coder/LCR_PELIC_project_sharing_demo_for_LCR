I have been living in Pittsburgh for 2 years. When I lived in Korea I had worked for company. My hobby IS WATCHING sports such as baseball football and soccer but I DON'T LIKE a basketball game. My favorite team is Detroit Tigers which was American Champion last year. I expect to watch their game this year. I am studying in ELI because I want to master Grammar completely. I AM NOT TRYING to find a dictionary because my reading teacher recommends it. It is so difficult to inferring a meaning.
