I had never been snowboarding before but three years ago when I was skiing in the High Tatras I saw one girl doing that. She was excellent and it was a little bit dangerous. I also decided to try it. I had bought some clothes for cruel start and my first snowboard. I had wanted to teach it by myself but it was impossible. It was too difficult. Now my boyfriend has been trying to learn me how to do it. I haven't regret it. It is beautiful winter sport. I haven't decided yet but maybe I will buy snowboard here and try American mountains.
