When I quiited suddenly my boss must have been glad that I wouldn't work with him anymore. My boss and I could never have got on well each other. However I should have tried to find a better way instead of quitting suddenly. It was a sudden decision that I didn't think deeply. I might have talked about the problem with other people who can trust. They had to have given me some good advise to solve the problem.
