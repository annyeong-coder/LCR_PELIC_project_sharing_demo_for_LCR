Then I have to praying to Allah that means GOD . Second in Wednesday I'll go to ELI at 7 45 a. M. Because I have to take some of classes with my friends. So I'll meet someone who works in La Roche College at 1 00 p. M. After that I'll do my homework such as writing listening and grammar. Third in Thursday I'll go to visit my favored friend and we're going to eat dinner together. Finally in Friday I have to go praying to Allah and I am going to DC at 4 30 p. M. With my friends because we have something with my government . However I don't know how long we had better spend in the WD. This is my schedule for this week I would like to enjoy with my favored friends.
