I agree this researching report. Taking myself to be an example when I try to find a closer or soul mate I always pay attention to smell his her odor. I do not refuse if the odor is the same as mine but diverse scent takes my curious and more attention. Smelling his her odor has already become one of my hobbies and one standard while I am choosing a closer or soul mate. If my mate does not have any scent or I cannot smell it from my mate he she still can be my friend. Hence good smelling adds a point when I choose a soul mate but without any smell is ok for me. If someone's odor smells not good there will be a shortcoming come out in my mind. It forces me to fall back from a process of making a friend. Even though I bolster this smell research I am still curious about how the odor defenses against disease and illness. Does any other article or Tim Jacob's research refer to how the odor defenses against disease and illness
