Studying in the U. S. Has a lot of advantages. Most importantly we can easily get used to English. We can meet many people using English everyday everywhere we go. Even a day we cannot help speaking or hearing English to live in the U. S. The next advantage is that we can naturally learn about all of the U. S. Such as its culture society political issues history geography etc. Through TV radio newspaper magazine and so on. In addition we can make many friends from other countries because we have the same feeling as a foreigner and have trouble adapting to the cultural difference between the U. S. And each native country. Moreover we can experience the education system and method of the U. S. Which are different from the education system and method of our country. It is very beneficial for us to study in the U. S.
