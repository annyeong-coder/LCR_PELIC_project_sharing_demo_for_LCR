Hi I'm Yuko. Nice to meet you! I have been building this site for a few months and I am almost finished. Now let me introduce myself. I was born and grew up in Tokyo. My mother has been living in Tokyo alone because my father past away seventeen years ago. My late father was an editor. He gave me a lot of books in my childhood and I read all books that he had recommended me. The one thing which I had promised with him was reading a book to the end whatever I put my hand. I have never broken this promise until today. Besides I am interested in the wine. Before coming here I had worked for the company which importing wine from European countries for example France Italy Spain and Germany. I had been engaged in buying wine from these countries. So I have been learning about wine for a several years. Since I came to the U. S. I have been interested in also California Wine. Therefore my hobbies are books and wine. Drinking wine and reading books always make me happy.
