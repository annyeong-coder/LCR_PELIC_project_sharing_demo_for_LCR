The wealth of nations One of the unanswered questions in the economic world is that how come the poor and developed countries find it hard to push them selves out of poverty and in to growth and prosperity To answer that question a group of economists after studding different cases discovered that the old theory of factors of production can not help developed and poor countries to reach their potential. So they developed a charted map of products that can show each country's competitive edge which will allow them to which product is best for them to develop at the time. On the chart each category of products is represented as a node. And when the nods are close they drew a line to connect them. The nods that are connected to many other nods form a cluster. So by looking at each country's product node we can easily know what other products are connected to it which will help us know what category of products we should develop.
