My best friend is Kie who lives in my hometown. Maibara which has only one elementary school and junior high school is my hometown. So we went to same schools from kinder garden and we also went to same high school that built in Japanese castle. She was kind to me and made me laugh. We fought a lot when we were in junior high school but we made it up soon. In junior high I was always asking her questions that I could not understand in class. There were some friends who studied in classroom after the class. So Kie and I studied in there with them. After studying we usually went to supermarket which is called Heiwado. We always eat ice cream that has strawberry jam inside. Now she is studying in Japan. So when I go back to Japan I want to meet her with ice cream.
