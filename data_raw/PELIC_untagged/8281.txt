Sometimes a litte friend turns out to be a great friend. When I was younger I had a friend who wasn't familier with me. Always I didn't make a great friend as soon as possible so the friend couldn't become my best friend. Someday one of the our classmates had his wallet stolen in the class. Unfortunately I was accused unjustly because my seat was the most close place that was the stolen spot. When I was in difficulty the friend expained the circumstantial evidence in detail for me. After all I could clear of the false accusation owing to his expaination definitely. Then not only could the friend and me become getting the great friendship but also he was just the best friend now.
