Myungji Last Name 5U June 1 2010 In my opinion the birth order has an crucial influence on an individual's personality because parents treat their child in a different way according to the birth order. Parents expect first child to be more responsible and stable while a later child to be more adorable and amiable. Children inherently tend to act up to their parent's expectation leading to the influence on individual's personality. For example in my case I have one older sister and one younger brother. My parents have raised my older sister to be strong and responsible because she is the firstborn child. Therefore she not only has a mature and sensible attitude but also takes care of my family and her friends. On the contrary my parents have been more generous to me and my younger brother so that my younger brother and I are more immature and playful. Even if I've grown up already people who around me always take care of me and I'm sometimes being childish. To sum up I believe that an individual's personality is affected by the order of birth mostly.
