The United States Department of Agriculture USDA changed the Food Guide Pyramid in 2005 to help people personally balance their diet. The new pyramid divides the foods into six groups and uses each color and triangle to represent a specified group. The smaller triangle such as oil means that you need less of the foods in your life. Some of the Food groups include subgroups according to the website of USDA such as the Grains Group has whole grain and refined grain groups. Besides you can find that there is a small man climbing the stairs on the pyramid. It may imply that it is important to take exercise every day. The messages which the pyramid tells us include eating a variety of foods eating less of some foods and more others and taking exercise everyday. What's the difference between the new and old version of the Food Guide Pyramid First the food relationship shows a hierarchy in the old version however it shows that the importance level of the food groups is all equal in the new version. Second some of food such as dry beans and peas are also included in the Vegetable and Meat Groups due to their nutrition. Finally the new version highlights the exercise and it can communicate the concept that food and exercise are all important factors which can lead your healthy life rather than the old version only focus on health diet.
