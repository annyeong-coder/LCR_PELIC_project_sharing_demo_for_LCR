I like riding bicycle One of my favorite sports is riding a bicycle. When I was 16 years old my father sent me a bicycle. It was the first gift from my parents. I began to like riding the bicycle from then on. After I graduated from Beijing Science and Technology University in 1983 I spent two month salary to buy a new bicycle. Then I rode the bicycle to work everyday. My son had a bicycle too. We enjoyed going outside every week. August from 18 to 22 2005 my son and I had finished a long distance traveling. It was about 450 miles from Beijing to Taiyuan Shanxi. It took 5 days. It was extremely hard for us but it was a pleasure for us. I never thought that we could finish so a long distance traveling on bicycles. This travel was really instructive for us. I love riding bicycle.
