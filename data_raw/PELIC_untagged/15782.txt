Two years ago when one of my confident went to France for her studying I often called her mom to say hello. She is very attentive. So we could spend time without being at a loss for word. One day I heard my friend's news into conversation which is kind of secret. Her mom said that her airplane was put off the departure time for the weather so she was going to be late. I was embarrassed. When I had called her up she had told me that she wanted to go on her study in Paris. Actually she had already gotten through with her study before the week. She wanted to drop in my place without any telling. I cleared up this story to her mom. It was funny. After hung up the phone I called up my friend but she didn't answer because she already set out her place. I could figure her out about her plan. So I decided to pretend that I knew nothing about it. But she made a phone call to me at Japan. As her airplane was stopped in there she was so boring. She told me that she just sit down on the chair with holding on the time. My boring friend told me everything about her terrific plan on the phone. Her plan was finished by the weather. I got together with her in the airport with her mom. It was an episode that I experienced about the phone. Actually I am going to do it over when I go back to Korea.
