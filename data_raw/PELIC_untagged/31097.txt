I used to live in the Olya Riyadh which considers as the heart of Riyadh city. I used to hang out with my friend ANON_NAME_0 whose hair is too short. We went to ALMMLKAH which located in the Olay and we talked to every one there . Moreover Sara singing in the Saudi Arabia channel is a great opportunity for Saudi women. Finally I really missed Olya Which is awonderful place to live in Saudia Arabia.
