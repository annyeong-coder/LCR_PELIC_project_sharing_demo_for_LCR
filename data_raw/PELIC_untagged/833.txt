Personal Letter Oct. 16 2006 Dear Mom Long time no see! Is everything okay in Taiwan I'm fine in Pittsburgh. The weather is changeable here and my skin becomes dry. Hence I want to buy hand cream to protect my hands. But I'm so confused about two products one is Crabtree Evelyn Crabtree another is L'OCCITANE. Although they are similar in protecting my hands from dry. There are many differences between Crabtree and L'OCCITANE. First they have different sizes and prices. The smallest size in Crabtree is 1. 7 Fl oz. Costs 7. 00 And in L'OCCITANE is 1 fl oz. Costs 9. 00. The content in L'OCCITANE is lesser than it in Crabtree but the price in L'OCCITANE is more expensive than Crabtree. The large size in Crabtree is 3. 4 Fl oz. Costs 14. 00 And in L'OCCITANE is 5. 2 Fl oz. Costs 25. 00. The content in L'OCCITANE is bigger than it in Crabtree and the price in L'OCCITANE is still more expensive than Crabtree. If I want to use hand cream for a long time I should buy L'OCCITANE. However I think that L'OCCITANE is too expensive for me to buy it. In addition L'OCCITANE hand cream blended with alluring aromas of jasmine and ylang ylang essences and Crabtree hand cream blended with rose water. Hence the flavors in L'OCCITANE are richer than those in Crabtree. However the flavor in Crabtree smells better than L'OCCITANE. If you were me which one you prefer to buy it or have you ever used them before I need your suggestions please reply my letter. LOVE
