I went over about past perfect after I finished the class. He left out my name when he called all of our names in class. He likes to make out such an interesting story. She points out the ice cream which is her favorite. He set up his business well so now he is one of the successful people. I took out the novel yesterday. I will turn in this homework to online after I finish this. I should buy another new pen because my friend used up mine yesterday
