A place that is special to me It was 5 years ago. I had almost empty and huge room which had white walls. The room had double doors and it was white too. At the right I had a green and square closet my clothes were clean and tidy as usual. My window was accross to the door it was round and had a window seat which was green and smoothy. In front of my window seat there was a green rectangle table and a small statue on the table. Statue referred our first president it was made of ceramic. My books and notebooks were on the left and my gray pretty cute pencilbox was standing on the right. I had a comfertable chair it was also flexible because I could move very fast with it. My bed was standing at left corner it wasn't too big but pretty good I was feeling very relaxed after I woke up. When I opened the window I was smelling colorfull flowers. Especially in spring it was unbelievable. There are several trees and a lot of plants in the garden and that combine was making me crazy. It was fantastic.
