Mr. President I decided to write this letter to you because the influence of the US tobacco internationally worries me. As we all know American tobacco brands have been propelled into every corner of the world with just four companies controlling 70 percent of the global market. Marlboro Kool Kent They have become as omnipresent around the world as they are here in the United States. With declining sales in this country foreign markets have become increasingly critical to the tobacco companies' financial health The top US tobacco firms now earn more from cigarettes sold abroad than in the United States. The USA tobacco companies rapidly occupying every place in the world. Some american cigarette companies even found out some profitable way of selling their products they send some samples of the cigarettes they make for free and people who try that of course will want to buy them again. It becomes like a drug like a body need for a person. As it states in Herald Tribune the Global Edition of the New York Times A new report issued by the World Health Organization offers the first comprehensive analysis of tobacco use and control efforts in 179 countries. It notes that tobacco including american will kill more people this year than tuberculosis AIDS and malaria combined. It warns that unless governments do more to slow the epidemic tobacco could kill a billion people by the end of the century the vast majority in poor and middle income countries. I personally think that the USA as a largest tobacco producing and exporting country should decrease tobacco sale internationally or put a limit to every american tobacco company or increase tax on tobacco so that they stop making people dependent to their product and ruining people's health. I hope you will think about my proposal and will take actions on this. Thank you Mr. President in advance for your concern in this matter. Yours truly
