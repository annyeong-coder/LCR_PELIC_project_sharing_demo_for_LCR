Holidays is the best thing in every person life. All people like holidays and it is strat from Friday till Sunday. Many people prefere the Fridays instade of Sundays. Others like Sundays more than Fridays because it is all the day off and they do not have any work to do. People should justify their resons about loving or prefering this days First I am going to talk about the similarities between this two days. As we can see both of them are a days of this is similar. People can enjoy their time in the both days. The time in Fridays is the same time in Sundays. Also the homworks in Fridays is the same as the homeworks in Sundays. For example both days I have to submit. Second their are a lot of diffrences between the two days. One of the huge diffrences is that Sunday is a day for relaxcation and sleeping. However Fridays is a day for enjoynment and having fun such as going to the cinema and having a road trips. Also there are a schools on Fridays so this is not the same as Sundays because it is all the day off. The day after Fridays is a day off and the day after Sundays is a working day. In concloion people prefer the both days and its a matter of fact of the holida resons. If it is up to me I would choose the Fridays because I always have more fun in Fridays. As I saied people are the one who can choose and they have their own resons of prefering the day that they like. They can reveal their love to those days by having fun and enjoying their time.
