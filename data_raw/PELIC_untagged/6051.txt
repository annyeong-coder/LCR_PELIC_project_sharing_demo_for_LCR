Auguste Rnoir was a French artist who was a leading painter in the development of the Impressionist style. Later years he suffered from rheumatoid arthritis and developed progressive disabilities in his hands and ankylosis of his right shoulder. Also he couldn't move without a wheelchair because his limited joint mobility. As he could adapt his painting technique to those conditions he was able to continue to paint by having a brush strapped to his paralyzed fingers and using a moving canvas or picture roll to faciliate painting large work. In addition he could create sculptures by directing an assistant who worked the clay. As the result he left a lot of arts to be able to fascinate people in the world.
