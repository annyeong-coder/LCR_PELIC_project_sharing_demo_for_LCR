In this paragraph I will write about the person who I know very well. He was the best teacher I have ever had. He was Dr. Aziz my Finance professor. He finished his graduate studies in the USA in 2000 at Syracuse University. He was kind flexible supportive and honest. For instance his lecture was very useful and interesting. Also He was the funniest person I had ever known in my life. Moreover when he explains the lecture he would always do something funny to get our attention and to make students laugh. Further more he used the real life stories to explain the lesson which is more interesting for me. In addition he explained the lectures in English language so I get benefit from him a lot. Above all he hanged out with us many times which indicate that he is so friendly with his student. I miss him so much and he is the best person I have known and the best teacher ever.
