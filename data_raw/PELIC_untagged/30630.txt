The united states is a country of immigrants beginning with the Spanish French and English in the 1600s. Immigration was an important part of founding America and economic opportunities have inspired immigrants to move to America. Immigrants are expected to embrace the beliefs and standards of American society. Most immigrants groups try to keep parts of their own culture language and religious practices. As a result traditionally the united states has been described as a melting pot a place where the previous identities of each immigrant group are melted down to create a mutual or shared society. Some people think that the mosaic each piece keeps its own special identity while contributing to a larger design better represents the diverse multicultural society of the united states. Today many Americans value their immigrant heritage as an important part of their identity.
