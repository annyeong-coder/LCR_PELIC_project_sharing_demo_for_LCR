I want to write about my home. I did not think of feng shui before moving in. However I find out that my apartment is quite a good place. My home is located in 3rd floor and heading south so it is really sunny. In addition it is painted in white. That makes it brighter. During the night I light my living room up with three lamps. Thus I always keep my apartment bright. I feel comfortable and relaxed at home. However living in 3rd floor is not so easy for a mom. I have to go up too many stairs with holding my son in my hand. It could be dangerous. So I am planning to move out this summer. We spend most of time playing in the living room. My son's toys are all around in the living room. Before going to bed I have to clean it up. I put back the books and toys and throw away some papers which my son tore it down. And I end my day up with putting off every light.
