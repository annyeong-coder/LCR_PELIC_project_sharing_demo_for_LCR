By the time I was in high school I had been playing soccer with my friends in the neighborhood. Before that I had not touched a ball completely. After I finished the high school I had moved to Dhahran city in order to study in a university. Since then I have not played soccer. But I have been watching soccer games either on TV or attend to the stadium with my friends. I hope to play it again.
