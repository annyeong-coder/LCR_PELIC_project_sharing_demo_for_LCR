First of all in category 1 I am a person who is introvert. I am not a people person. Also I am tired when I am with a lot of people. I get energy from reading a book listning music. My friend whose name is Mee jin has exact same characteristic with me. We often meet at the cafe which has big windows we sit together and see the view where I lived without saying. After then I became energetic person. Also in category 2 I am a person who make conclusions based on past experiences. I spend most of time to think about something that I already experienced and think about other possibilities about one option. It helps me to make conclusions correctly. I have never fought with my best friend whom I still contact a lot with because I always make conclusion of her behavior based on past experiences. Next in category 3 I am a thinker. I do not usaually make decisions based on feeling that I feel instantly. Before I make decision I think a lot about things which bring side effects. Finally in category 4 I am a person who likes to make decision. I do not like when people order something to me.
