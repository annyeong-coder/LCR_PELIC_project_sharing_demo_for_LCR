Today my friends think of me as a serious student but they don't know about me stupid phase. Until two years ago I think mostly about clothes and makeup and I usually judged people by their appearance and possessions. In that period of my life my friends and I always spoke in stereotyped phrases. We said Hell LO when something seems obvious and Whatever when we didn't care about something. I never want anyone to realize that I had interested in school. Some times I read the newspaper secretly and pretended to be unprepared for tests. One day my older brother came into my room while I read a serious novel. NO one has ever seen me do that before even though I had an avid reader for years. He thought I pretended to be interested in the book in order to impress a new boyfriend. I got angry when he laughed at me so I made a decision. I stopped hiding my real interests. Since that day I carried my news magazines proudly and expressed opinion in class. For the last two years I prepared for tests openly. Now I've applied for college and I'm feeling proud of being a good student.
