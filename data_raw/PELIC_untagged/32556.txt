Hi I would like to write a small story about my friend Tuba. I asked her some questions to get some information about something that she has done it during trips or gurneys. She told me that once she has taken a long car trip. She spent about 20 hours between Istanbul and Trabzon. Also she has ridden a horse twice Once in Istanbul in Turkish and another one in Syria. Another thing that she told me she has eaten unusual dissert in her neighbor's house. Another trip that she has been on a boat in Chanacaleh in Turkish. Also she has gone camping but it was exciting camping. It was camping just for women. They spent two days and she told me that it was fantastic. They could do anything without men.
