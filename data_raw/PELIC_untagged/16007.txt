When I first got to Pittsburgh I had an experience speaking to a telemarketer. I remembered one morning the phone went on ringing and was so annoying. I could not even decide whether I should pick it up or leave it alone. So I woke up and picked up the phone. Then I asked for his phone number so I can call him back. However he turned down my request but I didn't hang up the phone right away. Soon afterward he wanted me to sign up their product. I could tell how hard he was trying to talk me into buying their product. Unfortunately I had no interest to find out more information about their product. At that time I was very stressed from my company being closed. I need to talk things over with someone. Then I kept on talking about my problems and concerns. Moreover I asked him how to figure out my life's meaning. At the end of conversation I ended up with him truly helping me reduce stress. As it turned out the telemarketer became my friend in Pittsburgh. To summarize I have come up with the idea that a telemarketer could also be a counselor when you feel stress.
