I should have held my grudge against these advantage takers at that pleasant summer night. Sitting peacefully on the chair of the roof I surrounded by people so called 'colleagues'. Strangely those who deserved my hatred for the countless advantage taking from me during my military serving were drinking and chatting with me harmony. That night the sky was as clear and starring as my thoughts. I sincerely believed that the major reason that forced me grow up must relate to the people and events I encountered.
