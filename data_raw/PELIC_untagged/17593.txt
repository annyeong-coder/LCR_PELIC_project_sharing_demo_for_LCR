What I really like about the us is how people respect lining up for a service. What I really like about the us is how you can order some services online. What I really like about the us is that you can return return items to stores if you don't like them. What I really don't like about the us is how guns are available for public. What I really don't like about the us is how everyone in the street walks and listens to iPod without talking to anyone. What I really don't like about the us is that there is poor communication between family members.
