If I won a jackpot lottery I would have a lot of things to do. First of all I will try to keep it secret as long as possible because I have to handle a great many of situations. I will manage all of the money I have to several parts. Some of them will be kept in the bank for saving. Another part I will spend for new house car etc. . I will donate a lot of money for educational fund. Some of money will be invested for my future. The party will be set up for celebration and I will reveal that I won a lottery. I will use a little money in order to travel around the world. I will bring most of my friends with my trip and may be my teacher too.
