The graph shows presents the number of foreign and American students at Springfield Academy from 1992 to 2002. From 1992 to 1995 the number of foreign students remained the same. Also during those years the number of American students increased. In 1994 the number of American students was twice double the number of foreign students. In 1996 the number of foreign students was equal to the number of American students. Between 1998 and 1999 the number of American students remained the same. In 1999 contrary to 1994 the number of foreign students was twice double the number of American students. Between 2001 and 2002 the number of American students decreased but the number of foreign students increased. So the highest number of foreign students was in 2002. It's a good example when we have a graph that shows presents the number of students at specific times.
