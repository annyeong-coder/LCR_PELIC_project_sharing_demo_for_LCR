I think this would be a good thing if tourism to my country were to double in the next 20 years. First we could develop the business of tourism and gain earnings from the business. Now Japan may not be the most popular destination in the world tourism. However we have a lot of interesting historical and cultural sites which are worth to visit in Japan so Japan have inherent ability to enlarge the business. Also expansion of tourism would take crucial part to introduce Japanese culture to people all over the world. Sometimes some people could have mistaken image to Japanese culture and the image might lead to discrimination. Then it would be expected to generate right and proper image of Japan in the world by expanding tourism.
