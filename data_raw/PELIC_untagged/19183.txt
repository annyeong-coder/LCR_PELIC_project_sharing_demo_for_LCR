An accident happened few minutes before. The car was so fast. I think he didn't know that there is a traffic lights. Because if he knew he could drive slow. The traffic lights was red. When he saw traffic lights he push the brake. But it was too late. He was crush that car. That car was going normal. Because it was green on his side.
