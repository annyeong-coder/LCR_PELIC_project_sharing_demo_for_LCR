In these common days when the parents get older in age usually their children take them to the care center or put them in houses to live with other old people and the nurse's looks after them. Their children seem that this is a very easy way to drop them in a care center. However the parents took care of their children and grew them up so at least they should take care of them. The parents took care of their children all the years and grew them up. They give their children everything they need they worked hard to provide them with their needs and to let them happy in their life. So the least thing that the children must take care of their parents in their home and provide them with everything they need. You must remember that when you need them in the previous days they always help you. So you must help them when they get old. The most important thing that the old people like is to be surrounded with other family members. In my country the most important one in every family is the grandparents. In every small and big thing we ask their permission. On every week we have a common day in the weekend that all the family members gather in the grandparent's house and we spend the whole day with them.
