What are the qualities of a good neighbor We all live with other people. Actually neighbors are the people who live near us. Neighbors are very important because they can be our best friends if we get along with each other well. Here are some qualities of a good neighbor interests to each other frequent contacts and willingness to help when we are in need. The first quality of a good neighbor is a basic interest in our neighbor. It would be the first steps to be close each other. The easy way is to greet gladly whenever we meet. If we don't have any interests in our neighbor there is not a chance to know each other well. The second quality is that we contacts very frequently. If we don't meet often it is difficult to be feel close each other. The more we meet the more we feel close and friendly. For instance I have a good neighbor. We often have a dinner and sometime go on a picnic together and also have a happy birthday party. Especially when we buy something special we share and give it. Through this opportunity we get to a good neighbor and also a good friend. The third quality is the willingness to help in needs. Sometimes we could have a difficult or emergent time. At that time we need other's help. When we really need other's hands our neighbor's help will make the relationship between neighbors stronger and deeper. For example when I was pregnant I broke water suddenly so I have to deliver my baby 3 weeks earlier than my due date. At that time I didn't prepare infant car seat so I asked my good neighbor to buy and bring it to the hospital and they gave me it for a gift. It was very thankful experience. To have a good neighbor is very wonderful. I think that the qualities of a good neighbor are interests to each other frequent contacts and lastly willingness to help when we are in need.
