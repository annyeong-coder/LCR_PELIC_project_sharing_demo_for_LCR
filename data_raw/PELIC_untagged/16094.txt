When I started living in Pittsburgh about 2 years ago I used to drive to go everywhere. That I drive a car is a kind of fun. One day I had parked my car in Shadyside during taking an English class at church. After it finished I could see that a parking ticket was put. Why I got it was not obvious while Wrong way was mentioned on it. Some cars did not have parking tickets in spite of the way of parking. I talked with my English teacher about the problem. He recommended that I go to the traffic court. Although I had never experienced to go to the court I decided to claim that I was not guilty. A few weeks later I went there to take a trial and prove my guilty. That I visited a court made me nervous. Finally a judge likely accepted my guilty. That I made a plea led a reduction of the fine. I was very pleased at the consequence. After the trial I was very surprised when I glanced at my car that was parking on the street. I also got another parking ticket because time was over. I was no better off than I was.
