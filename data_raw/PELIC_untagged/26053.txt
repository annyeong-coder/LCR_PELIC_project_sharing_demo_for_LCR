Dear Mr. ANON_NAME_0 I am a student at the EFL. Computer Training Institute. My classes are very good but the institute had better make some improvements or many students are going to leave. First I think you should fix the ceiling of the lap. Second you ought to call the cleaning office to clean the lap up every day. Third you had better call the students and tell them that not allow to through the papers on the floor. Fourth you should write a note that says you are not allowed to bring any drinks or foods into the lap. Finally the lap does not have enough computers disks and chairs for the students and you should ask the center about buying more lap's stuff for us. Thanks for your time and help Hadi
