My definition of success It is most important to me what I feel now Am I happy Or satisfied Or depressed I always think about my emotion which tells various aspects I have like my characteristic or which situation I feel happy in. Actually it relates to my definition of success. I think if I feel satisfaction happiness or pleasure about something it's my success to me. I don't think success exists too far. It is so subjective and relevant. However the opinion about success of my family is different from me. They somewhat tend to pursue wealth a lot of money or honor while I prefer emotional things more than others. Of course lots of money or honor important to me they also consider their feeling important and want to be happy and satisfied but I think we have different goal and different meaning of success in our lives. In culture it is similar to the case of my family. People usually want to be a famous person and make a lot of money. I was likely to believe that standards of success are wealth honors something like that. But I realized if only chase these things after all I could not find happiness or won't be happy. Do you know the tail of a boy and a girl searching for blue bird It seems like the tail what I would like to say about success. Most people have each standard of success. When we question somebody about what success is someone might say wealth or others might say honor. I answer that my success is to feel happy or satisfaction. Although I'm in trouble with something I always try to be happy.
