Traveling makes me happy. I am really like to travel. One of my memory among the past the best memory was staying in Cambodia. I stayed in cambodia 6weeks for volunteering to help poor people who didn't learn and get foods. I did health education because it was my major in the university. It was hard to teach about importance of maintaining health which are a way of brushing teeth and wearing a underware. Simple things that have to be kept but in Cambodia they didn't keep these things. This expierience makes me change. Before that traveling I was a selfish person. But after that I want to think about other person instead of myself. Also I want to look for my job about helping people.
