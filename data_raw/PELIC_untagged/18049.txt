Wearing religious clothing is a human right. It shouldn't be violated anywhere. That means people should be free to wear their religions clothing when they out of their original place. For example Muslims have to travel for different purposes travel for studying is one of them. These students should feel free to wear their religious clothing at school or in any place. Although students should feel comfortable and save to focus on their study some schools made students lose these feelings by prevent them from continue to study because of their cloths. What happened to Begum in school in London is an example of that. In addition the issue in French these days about considering law to prevent coerced Muslims attire wearing is not helpful. Both Muslims leaders and Muslims parents try to instill many values of Islam in Muslims. One of them is wearing women Islamic garments which isn't revealing cloths. The purpose from wearing this clothing is to protect these women from a lot of attention from men which will increase if they wear revealing cloths. In French people who try to rule this law are misunderstood this purpose. Therefore they think that they will help women to be freedom. Lastly wearing religious clothing is a human right and nobody can decide something about it except religions leaders and religion book. If each one obeys to any law against his her religion in any country where he she lives gradually nobody will have a real strong religion.
