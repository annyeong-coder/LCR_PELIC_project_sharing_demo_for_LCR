I am going to introduce my best friend Ho young. When I was a child I met him in middle school. I thought he was very interesting so we got along well quickly. First his height is about 170cm and he is not fat. He has a high nose and long ears and he has bad eyesight so he wears classes. He also usually wears blue jeans and a big T shirt. His hairstyle looks neat. He is not handsome but when smile he he is cute. Second I always enjoy the time with him because he can imitate almost everyone. He has many funny things. So he is most popular among my friend because my friend makes everyone comfortable and fun. He always smile to everyone and he comforts me anytime when I am worried about something. He also try to care and understand other friends. Finally I am pride of my friend who makes us happy and comfortable all the time.
