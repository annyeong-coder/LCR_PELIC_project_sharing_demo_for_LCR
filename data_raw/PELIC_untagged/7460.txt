When I was 16 years old I had the very best friend in my life. We just looked like real sisters because we did many things together experienced the same situautions and had a lot of fun. But then for some reason she didn't trust me because of something I didn't do. She could have listened to my explanation when the thing happened and I should have forced her to listen to me. Because after it had happened we became like strangers two people who had never met before. Thought we started to talk one year later I felt strange about our relationship. I think we will never be truly honest with each other anymore.
