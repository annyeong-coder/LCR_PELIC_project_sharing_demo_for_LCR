I saw a car accident last year when I was going to school. I felt too bad for that accident. The first car hit the second car because the driver was driving too fast. Then the police and ambulance cars came to help the second driver who was bleeding. The first driver did not get injured. It was one of the worst accidents I have ever seen. I hope that everyone drive safe.
