In America no matter what kind of garbage usually we through all of the garbage into trash cans. Considering the environment this behavior should be changed. People living in Taiwan produce as much garbage as American. However we recycle most of the recyclable resources. For example we collect alumni cans batteries clean plastic bags electronic devices and wasted paper. In some cities and counties they even gather the residual of food to change it into manure. This action reduces our garbage a lot. Therefore in my opinion American government should force people to recycle those useful resources instead burn or bury all of them.
