There are many advantages that I like about watching television. First I can watch my favorite's movies on the TV because there are many beautiful movies I like it on the TV. Also I can find specific channels that served sports in this worldwide. Second I like also some wonderful programs on the TV because they make me exiting to sit on the sofa and watch the entire program until the end and I can't change the channel or turn off the TV like Nancy Gracy . Also there are many commercials I like it because they are too short and clear. Next I can get a lot of information about life or pets or anything I want. I can also practice listening and learn some vocabulary while I watch TV. Then when I have extra time and I don't know where I can spend it I can watch TV to spend that time. For these advantages I like the TV too much.
