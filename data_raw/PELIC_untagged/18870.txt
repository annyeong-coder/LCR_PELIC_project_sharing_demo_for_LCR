When I studied to enter university I lived separated from my family for 7months. I had my friend who is in same case with me. The friend got me to know what real friend is. She had me talk real mind to each other. So We could be more closed friend. She let me say anything to her when I was sad. She helped me to live less lonely during the times. Sometimes She made me annoy. But There won't be real friend like her in the world.
