I know your aspect is so difficult. You love Jim and you want to marry with him and also you love your parents and you don't want your parents being unhappy. On the other hand this is change for you because a lot of people try to find their mate. For this reason you don't worry. I have same suggestions for you . Firstly you should go back to Japan for holiday and you should try to convince your parents. If you wouldn't work out this problem in Japan secondly you should experience to meet them. I think if Jim can be friend with your parents they can be accept your marriage. You have a lot of time to convince them. Good luck. Tevhide
