Haga where I grew up is a very small hamlet in Korea. I went to an elementary school in Haga and I remember the day when I was graduated from the elementary school. That day when it was heavily snowing was very cold. My mother who still live there went to graduation ceremony and I lived alone in Ansung where is famous for a pear until I was graduated from a high school. My friends that were graduated from the elementary school with me still live there. A friend of them whom I met in Seoul last has three children. Other friend of them whose son is going to a middle school was married early. I want to return that hamlet which I always miss.
