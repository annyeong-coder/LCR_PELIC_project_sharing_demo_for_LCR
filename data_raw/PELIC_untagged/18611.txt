When I was a teennager in the Philippines I was an expert on snacks and fast food. I was growing fast so the more I ate the hungrier I felt. The street vendors in our town had better snacks than anyone else. In the morning I used to buy rice muffins on the way to school. They are much sweeter than American muffins. After school I ate fish balls on a stick or adidas chicken feet . Snacks on a stick are smaller than American hot dogs and burgers but they are much more varied. My friend thought banana cue banana on a stick was really great. However they weren't as sweet as kamote cue fried sweet potatoes and brown sugar my favorite snack. When I came to the United States I didn't like American fast food at first. To me it was less intersting than my native food and less tasty too. Now I am getting used to it and it seems more and more delicious. Does anyone want to go out for a pizza
