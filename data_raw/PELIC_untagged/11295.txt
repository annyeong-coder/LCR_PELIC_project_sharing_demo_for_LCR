Many kinds of friends I think that people have several friends who have a variety of personalities. Also I have a few kinds of friends. First one of my friends is very funny. The man who has become my friend since 1996 always used to play the fool and entertain me however I can't meet him now because he's studying in Italy. Another friend really likes cars that have a luxury or sports style. One year ago he became a car owner whose car never looks like a luxury car. However he is happy as before because of it. Finally I have a friend who is serious excessively. He likes something which is a mystery story or movie so he always tries to examine closely when he talks with persons. Although the friends whom I make above mention about have diverse personalities they are all of my best friends.
