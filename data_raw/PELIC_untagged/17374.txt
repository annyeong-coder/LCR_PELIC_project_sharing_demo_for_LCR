I feel in the ELI classroom is not so bad. I wish they would change the color because the ELI is a very old building. I think we should take out the broken chars out the class. I think we had better hang up some posters. So we would touch up the window. My classroom is bright and sunny. This cheers me up. My classroom is small but I can't tear down the walls. I think it will look more spacious if I just straighten it up with just a few small changes. I'll end up feeling happier in my classroom. It is worth trying out.
