People can entertain themselves in so many ways. Some often like outdoor activities the others enjoy hanging out with friends. As for me the things which I like to do every time I have the chance are categorized according to the benefit I can gain whenever I do them Outdoor activities are my number one thing that I like to do whether with family or friends. For example I enjoy swimming a lot in the sea diving and having fun with collecting seashells. Another activity that I like too is playing volleyball and I play it not only for having fun but also to have a good health and a great body shape. One thing I like is horse back riding it is one of my favorite activities because I can relive what old people used to do when they don't have any means of transportation. In addition being brave and not afraid to give it a try. My second thing I like to do is consists of a lot of technological and electronic devices. For example I like making videos For instant I enjoy talking about my favorite TV shows and that can help me improve my speaking skill but at the same time I can have fun too. Also I like recording myself talking about different topics so it is helpful to have more knowledge and the ability to speak very fluently. Finally every thing about music is such an important thing for me to try and get myself involve with. For instance I like singing karaoke I have a lot of good times doing it regularly. This is not only a hoppy that I enjoy but from it I can learn so many strong words that can help me improve my English language and be able to use them on my daily life. In conclusion from all of these activities we can learn and at the same time enjoy our time whether we did them individually or with family and friends. Try to do every thing you like don't be afraid it is now or never.
