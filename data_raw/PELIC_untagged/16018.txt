When I was a freshman in a university I chose engineering as my major. Although I studied my major for 6 years I have felt regret I should have chosen other major. I was interested in painting but my parents didn't want for me to be an artist. Back then I could have persuaded my parents. And since I came to America I have often thought like 'I might have talked other expressions'. While I'm talking to someone I cannot realize what wrong expressions which I used are. After finishing a conversation I think 'I had to used other word idiot'.
