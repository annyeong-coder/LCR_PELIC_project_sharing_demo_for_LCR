Because Pittsburgh is located in North side of the United Stated most of the Pittsburghers know how to deal with a snowstorm. Nevertheless it is crucial to be always careful of a snowstorm. There are several ways that make them safe from it. First of all when it's strongly snowing staying at home is best. While Pittsburghers stay at home they watch local news about weather. In the local news they can know information related to whether the places that they want to go to are open or not. Until weather is stable they have to wait at home cleaning the road in front of their house for the neighbors who want to go through the road though they are reluctant to clean the road. Second Pittsburghers have to be aware that an unpredictable situation can occur. If they have no preparation the situation can be worse even triggering a difficult position. For example electricity can be stopped by a snowstorm.
