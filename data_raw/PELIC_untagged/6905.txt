When you study in ELI you can be classified into three types people who want to enter a university in USA people who want to live in USA and people who want to get a good job in their country. First of all people who want to enter the university are mostly younger than other people. They just finished a high school and they want to enter the university as soon as possible. People who want to get the good job are almost graduated a university or a undergraduate. So they want to learn English as soon as possible. Finally people who want to live in USA are very variety. It include someone who wife of a scholar have master degree. I think they want to improve speaking and listening rather than other subject.
