After I finished a sophomore in Korea I came to the U. S on January this year. If I had not decided to come to the U. S I would have been a junior in my university. In fact I did not want to go to the U. S because I had a short time to meet my family and my friends after I finished a military service on July last year. I might have had an enough time to meet them if I had not gone to the military service. Before I came to the U. S I did not study English very hard. If I had studied English very hard at that time I would have had better English skills than now. After I came to the U. S I lived with a host family. I could not adapt to American culture well. If I had read books about that I could have adapted to American culture very well. Now I have been in the U. S for 9 months. I have learned many things such as English American culture and independence. I could not have learned the valuable things if I had come to the U. S. I will go back to Korea after two months. During the two months I wish my English skills could get better.
