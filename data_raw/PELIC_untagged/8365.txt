Being a student we have a lot of pressures. What kind of pressures does a student have In my opinion I think a lot of students have the same pressures tuition homework and grades. Some of students have troubles of paying their tuition because it is too expensive. Some of them choose to borrow money from bank others choose to find a part time job. If they choose to get a job they should know how to use their time well otherwise they might get a bad grade. Being a student we have much homework. Some homework should take a lot of time doing them. Some of students even more stay up all night to do their homework. If students always stay up for a long time they might have problems of their health even though they are young. A lot of students worry about their grades. For example if they want to enter a good college they should get good grades in exams such as TOFUL and GMAT. If they don't want to fair their exams they must study very hard. In conclusion I think a lot of students have the same stresses. How can they remove these stresses I think if they don't want to study try to do some activities such as do exercise and go outside sometimes it can let you feel relaxed and clear mind. Although being a student has a lot of stresses but don't be afraid just try to do your best!
