When I was a children my parents who invited many friends hiked the mountain and went to the picnic. We usually prepared so many fruit which we can eat when we was hiking. In addition hiking in the fall when we can see so many butterflies was a very comfortable thing. My cousin with whom I liked to play was older than me one years old. We have the same hobby that makes us very familiar. The most interesting thing is picnic that we can play game and cook some food by myself. Sometimes I think the food which we cook is the most delicious food in the world. After hiking the mountain my parents bring me to visit my uncle whose house is very big was located near the mountain. We like to play in the house where has a very beautiful garden is my favorite place. However This is a very happy memory in my mind.
