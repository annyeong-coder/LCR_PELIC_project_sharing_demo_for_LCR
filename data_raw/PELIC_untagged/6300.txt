Being careless is a bad habit. You have to be serious with your deeds especially if your future depends on them. Nowadays most students don't care about their study. Patrick for example a student who studies biology had an exam last Friday. However Thursday night he went to a party instead of studying for the exam. Friday morning after the instructor distributed the papers students began answering the questions. While the students were taking the exam the instructor was reading a book. After a while Patrick saw Mario's answers and then he quickly copied them all. As soon as Patrick finished copying the instructor collected the exams. Next Monday the instructor returned the exams to the students. After Patrick received his paper he looked at Mario's paper. Mario's got A but Patrick got F. After that Patrick realized that he copied all the answers wrong. Patrick was careless and he thought that he can get a good grade without studying. Now he knows that he shouldn't be careless he should be more pensive. That's why being careless is a bad habit. It might easily destroy your life.
