One month ago I had TOFEL. I went to the test center. The recieptionist asked may she saw my passport. I looked at my pockets and I did not find it . She said if my house was near so I caould take the test because half an hour left. I was driving fastly. When I got my appartment I asked my wife if she knew where was my passaport because I did not find it in the suit case that I put my passpot in. She said I had put it in the car because I was a fried to forget it before going to the test. As a result there was no benefit of going to my appartment . Then I went back to the test center.
