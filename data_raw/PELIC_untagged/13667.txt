My home is the most convenient place for me. My mother tidy up our home every day. Each one of my family is expected to throw the garbage away once a week. We used to hang up many pictures. Befor I came to the US we had fixed up the walls. In general each single thing in my home cheer me up bacause of that I want to go back to my home as soon as I finish my scholarship.
