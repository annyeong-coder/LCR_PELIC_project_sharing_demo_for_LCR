Yesterday ANON_NAME_0 and I were at the park where we had our first date. We were remembering what we were like back then when we use to play tennis and golf in our free time. We remembered all the things we had done together since we meet and we started to think about babies and parenting. ANON_NAME_0 who is a little afraid of hat subject asked me which were the characteristics that I thought were more important for a father I told him that we where a lucky couples whose parents had given a great example which would help us figured how to be great parents ourselves. After that conversation we returned home and days later I heard ANON_NAME_0 speaking with a friend of his who has two kids. He told him that the only qualities required to be a parent was patience and that the rest came with the kid's first smile.
