As a matter of fact no one can deny that living in the US is the best way to learn English. All of my friends that traveled to the US became very fluent on it. Of course it is necessary to travel to the country where a language is spoken in order to truly learn the language because you will practice it all the time and learn from native teachers. You can use the language everywhere when you buy something at the store talk with native speakers in the university or even at the bus. Also you can make friends with native speakers and talk with your neighbor. You may watch movies without subtitles to improve your listening skills. Maybe you will marry an American woman to speak English all the time and your children will be fluent in English. If you study English in your country the teacher will be using your own language and English that maybe will not improve your English skills. The teacher in America will use the English language and that is good for you because you will try your best to understand. Moreover the English teacher will do his best to teach you. The teacher will use correct pronunciation and that is good to speak like a native. Some students prefer to learn English in their countries because they will not make any efforts for their daily works like cooking to eat food and washing clothes so they depend on their families to do that. However that is not a good concept because they will not rely on themselves and their family will not stay with them forever. In my opinion it is easy to wash clothes and you can order from restaurants for food. Really it is important that you practice English all the time and learn from native American teachers. You will become very fluent in English if you study in the US so I advise you to do that if you have the chance.
