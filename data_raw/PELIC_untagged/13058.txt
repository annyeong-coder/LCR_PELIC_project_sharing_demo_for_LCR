The person who helped me learn new things is My boss who she had me do all the job without giving me much details and guidelines. That was because she wanted me to learn things from my own knowledge eventhough I don't have any experience in work. After that if there's any mistake she will help me correct it and clarify the reason why. Once I've done a big mistake with all the accounting report that she needed to use for the meeting in the next day. Though it was end of the working hour but she made me stay with her to correct all the figure in the report. Since this big error happened she got me not to be careless with the job again. However she still continue letting me do all the job on my own because she knew that I can handle all the problem from all the mistakes that I ad learn. She is a really great boss.
