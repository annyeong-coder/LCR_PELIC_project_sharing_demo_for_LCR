I am a hesitant person and I believe that this problem should be solved since it has a negative effect on my personality. For example in order to choose my major 2 months were spent before I decided to study in business school. In some cases time and effort are wasted however the consequences of being reluctant are not harmful even for me or for others. It really surprises me when I am asked for help or solution the response is ready. Recently a result was revealed by researcher said that people must be affected by life difficulties as a rational for this issue.
