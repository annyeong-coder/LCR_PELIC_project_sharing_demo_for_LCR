Okland has Extraordinary places where you can enjoy eating lunch with your family and Friends. Last week I went to many restraunts in and around Okland eventhough most of them have good services and food but I am attracted by Italian restraunt called Mellano Because it has pleasant surrounding tress flowers etc . In addition Its front is designed Well that attracts people to eat lunch in it. Beside that the restraunt s' hall is decorated well As well as provided a good quality of lighting which is comfortable to customers. Anotherthing waiters is very polite so customers s' orders are welcome at any time In hurry and good quality of services. Basically I enjoyed trying all new and different kinds of food. It has own special style of cooking food moreover It tastes good to me whatever you want to eat is available in good prices pizza pasta fish etc and all kinds of pavrage. To conclude restraunt is beautiful by its surrounding and it has good food services and prices.
