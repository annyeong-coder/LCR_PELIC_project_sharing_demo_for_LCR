I think friend is a person whom I can rely on when I catch a problem. If you have many friends it means that you have a many people who support you. In my case I have some friends whom I can talk about my problem. They are friends whose personalities are similar and we have hung out from elementary school. So we know each other very well. We can talk anything about us.
