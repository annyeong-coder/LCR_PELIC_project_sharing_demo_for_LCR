A century ago Thailand was a country which is rich in timberland. Most houses and furniture made of teak. From then on value of teak and other valuable timber has been increased. Because of that the number of timber is rapidly increased and the area of timberland is dramatically decreased. Despite of the legislation many traders hire tribesmen in order to smuggle timber out of a forbidden forest and sell on the black market. Moreover some forest rangers let traders smuggle it for extra money. Those impact environments in Thailand and cause many disasters. Thailand is stuck in flood every year and it seems like every flood is worse than before. Last year there was a flood in a town which is located in northern Thailand. The flood carried mud and timber. Furthermore it struck a village and made the village be under the mud. Some houses were flown in the flood and a lot of people was disappeared and killed. That is the worst disaster in the town ever. In order to reducing environmental problems which come from cutting down trees every Thai people should realize how severe the problems are and pool their effort as much as possible to solve the problems. If everyone do that the environment in Thailand will get better.
