When I graduated from university in 1997 I had a lot of opportunities about my future. My parents told me You should be inspector for Government. I made a decision and was an inspector. But I should have been a lawyer because I graduated from the Law Faculty. I think being an inspector is more difficult and take more time than being a lawyer. A lawyer can be earn more money than an inspector. My parents shuld not have told me You should be inspector. They could have supported me to be a lawyer. I could have studied more laws instead of economy. I should have been a law judge. But I didn't take any exams about this job. I think I could have passed this exam more easily. Because entrance exam for inspector was very difficult. And I had some troubles when I tried to pass this exam. Finally I should have been a lawyer or a law judgement. But today I continue to work as a tax inspector.
