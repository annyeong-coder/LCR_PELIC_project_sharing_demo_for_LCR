When I was a five years old. I had a very pretty bedroom. I spend a lot of time in my bedroom. Do you want to predict my bedroom. I can help you to describe my room. First of all when you entered my room my bed was on the back wall. Then I had a many toys. My toys were in the right corner. The carpet was in the middle of my room. On the top of my carpet was pictures about cartoon movies charecter. After my baby carrige was in the right corner. Finally I forgot to say that two windows were on the right wall. I had very nice time when I was in my room.
