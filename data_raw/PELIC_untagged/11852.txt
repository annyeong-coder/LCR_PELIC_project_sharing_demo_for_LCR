My favorite place to eat lunch in Pittsburgh is Panera Bread. First of all you can find in it a type of food healthy and genuine not full of calories and short of supply like other places in the United States especially fast foods like ANON_NAME_0's or Mc Donald's . In fact there is a large variety of choices like freshly baked breads bagels soups and salads. In addition there are also sweets pastries beverages and the Panera kids menu. Panera was established in 1981 its mission is giving a loaf of bread in every arm and from its foundation has always received good press releases. In Panera people can find also a welcoming environment with confortable areas where it's possible to relax and access to Internet without problems. So we can say that all the purposes of its mission have been completed with success.
