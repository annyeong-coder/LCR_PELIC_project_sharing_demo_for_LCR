While I was going to the hospital where I work in 2003 I fell down the stair. When I fell down I was holding cell phone. Unfortunately my little finger was broken because my fingers reached the floor first and were pressed by my body. I hurried up to go to the emergency room in the hospital As soon as I saw the doctor my little finger was fixed. After all my little finger was dressed a cast for a month
