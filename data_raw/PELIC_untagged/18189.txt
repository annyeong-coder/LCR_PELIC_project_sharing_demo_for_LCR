Hi My name is Coach and I am a student Brooklyn High School. I sent you my application form three weeks ago and you didn t answers me any way. I am worry about this. I want to find out any other programs. I am really interested in MBA and I have been making many efforts to be eligible for this program. I hope you could see my sincerity and resolution and please kindly consider my application. Again thanks for you time and all your help in the past. I look forward to your replay. Regards Coach.
