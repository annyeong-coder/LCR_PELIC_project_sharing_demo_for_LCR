I can say that I'm very luck. Since I was 8 I have a group of friends who're my best friends. We meet each other in Sao Luis which is my parent's city. There we studied in the same school which my uncle is the owner. There we had good times that we will always remember. But on my two last years of high school I moved to Sao Paulo that has the best school of the country to prepare me to the medical school that was my target. One of my friends moved to the same city two months after and we lived in the same apartment. After this I tried to get in the medical school in Rio de Janeiro which I was born and always dreamed in come back. Now all my five best friends who I know since I was kid live there too and in the same street! And one of them is my classmate.
