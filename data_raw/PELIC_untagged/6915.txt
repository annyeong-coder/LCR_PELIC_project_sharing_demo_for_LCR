I lived in Korea I have had a lot of phones from telemarketer. One day I waked up by big phone ring and I picked the phone up. A woman said that I was a VIP membership for them. She asked me my address sending a gift for me. I wanted to turn down her favor but I couldn't. Because the gift was a body lotion what I want to buy so I told my address. She wrote down my address and kept on introducing their new product. She suggested that I tried out their new diet medicine just two weeks. At that time I figured out that I was not the VIP membership and they wanted to sell their product to me. I told her to think over but she talked that the event did only one day and asked me whether I wanted to sign up their new diet program. So I said politely No. And hung up the phone.
