This article talks about which planets around other stars are actually suitable for life. In 1964 Stephen Dole published a scientific study habitable planets of man . His paper elevated a discussion about which planets had habitability or whether or not the surface temperature is between 0 and 100 Celsius. The big question now is how much we have explored in other habitable worlds so far. The first layer of the answer is rocky planets should be heavier a few times the mass of the earth. The second layer to the answer is how many of these new planets can satisfy the habitability standard. Possible habitable places must have temperate surface environments. And the author thinks that the inference from Stephen Dole's 1964 analysis about how many planets are habitable might be right.
