One movie I've watched recently is a drama named Million Dollar Baby and directed by Clint Eastwood. This movie starred Clint Eastwood as Frankie Dunn Hilary Swank as Maggie Fitzgerald and Morgan Freeman as Eddie Scrap Iron Dupris. It received several Oscar Awards in 2004 one of which was Best Achievement in Directing . I would like to recommend it to you for several reasons one of which is that it was a tragedy still shocking my mind long time after my first watching. It described a 32 year old woman making her greatest effort to demonstrate her abilities in boxing. She started to practice boxing at a very later age impossible for nearly all of us to succeed in it. However Her deadly injuries caused by an illegal attack from her opponent after bell ringing in a title fighting ended her boxing career and later her life completely out of expectation. What has surprised me is the indifference on her physical status from her family and further their being crazy for taking over her assets before her death.
