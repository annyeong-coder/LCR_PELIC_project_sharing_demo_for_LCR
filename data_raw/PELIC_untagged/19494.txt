I met my best friend while I was studying in middle school. She was my classmate. One day I was going to the market near my house when I met her. So I knew her house is not far from my house. After that she got to my home while I was having my breakfast every morning. Then we went to school together. At noon we had lunch together when we finished our lessons. She was taking good care of me when I was ill . And I made a present by myself when she was having a birthday party. We loved each other. Now I moved to the USA when she moved to Canada. But we still kept in touch. We would be good friends forever.
