Foreign Travel I enjoy traveling to foreign countries. Why I like to take a trip other countries because I can have get several good experiences through it. The first reason is that observing the valuable cultural assets in a museum can help me to understand the cultures of the country. When I went Paris with my family in 1988. I went to the Louvre museum and I saw the pictures. It reminded me to travel the country. The second reason is that I like tasting the traditional food. For example when I went to Thailand with my friend in 2006 I loved eating Thomyangkung. The dish was more delicious than the one I ate in Korea. The last reason is talking with people who live in the country. I have made some foreign friends when I traveled. For instance I lived in Tokyo for 1 year as exchange students. I made some friends in that time. Through these friends my comprehension about the culture of another country has grown. In conclusion I think that foreign travel is a really good experience for me because of these reasons.
