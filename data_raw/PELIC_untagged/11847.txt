MY house is my favorite place to eat lunch. First of all I really enjoy eating with my family especially when my kids beside me . I avoid having the lunch out my house because my wife and my kids always wait me to have the lunch together. I like to eat my traditional food in my house such as ASEDA RUSHDA and UASBAN. Also I dislike eating out my house even in my home country . In addition my wife is the best cooks and she Knows what I like and dislike to eat. Another thing eating lunch in our house it costs less than outside and we feel more comfortable when we eat inside . Finally we avoid eating out side the house because our religion do not allows us to eat some kind of food for example any thing related to the pig meet oil or fat. For these things I like to have lunch in my house.
