Sicheol Kim who is a good guy is one of my best friends. I've spent time with him when I lived in Korea. We went same school from elementary to high school in ANON_NAME_0 where we grew up. Here are reasons why I like him whom I mentioned. First he never has given up. He has kept try to do his best when he had hard time. Second I learned a lot of things when we worked in military where in ANON_NAME_0 city hall. Third he likes to play soccer. Some times we played soccer where near ANON_NAME_0 city hall which we worked together. Fourth he had read a lot of books that I am interested. After he read he recommended to me books which he thinks I like.
