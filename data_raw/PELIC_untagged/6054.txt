Seal pups are taken care of by their mothers until the mothers stop giving milk to them. Many mother seals travel together to get to the place of chosen area the Gulf of St. Lawrence where they can raise their pups before they bore their babies. Seal pups are very small when they are born in few days. At first they are coated white hairs and that help pups warm. Few weeks later the hairs take apart from pups we can see silvery grey coat with black spot then the coat grow as they are growing. When they completely grow mother seals got their pups to stop having milk from them and leave them. After mother seals leave their pups and meet male seals to mate they go back to Greenland where they come from. Meanwhile seal pups lie together on the ice and wait until it melts. They sometimes call their mothers but get used to being without mother then they also go to Greenland. Usually seals live for 30 yrs and they meet many dangerous creatures which want to eat them but most of all humans are extremely harm creature for them.
