My life will have full of glory. By the time I go back to Korea I will have received more than 100 points in TOEFL. After graduate my university I am going to Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology so called KAIST for my Ph. D. By the time I marry beautiful woman I will probably attend University of California Berkeley for my post doctorial degree. Then I will be a young and brilliant professor in chemistry. By the time I die I will have won Nobel price at least two times.
