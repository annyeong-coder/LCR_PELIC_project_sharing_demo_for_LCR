Summary Hans Rosling on HIV New Facts and Stunning Data Visuals ANON_URLSITE_In this conference the author shows the worldwide prevalence and trends of HIV since it emerged in 1981. Data is shown in dynamic graphs where incomes per capita versus HIV prevalence are traced. Specifically Rosling is advocated to explain how the HIV burden on African countries in an heterogeneous phenomena. This diversity among African countries cannot be explain entirely by wars poverty incomes or virus mutations. Instead other factors such as less condom use and age disparate sex could be the determinant factors to explain how African countries have different HIV prevalence rates. Rosling discloses about factors that conditioned HIV effective transmission such as sexual concurrency. He seems to insinuate that serial monogamy might be less relevant on HIV heterosexual transmission in comparison with sexual concurrency where HIV spread may be worst. Rosling concludes saying that preventing HIV transmission instead of drug therapy is the key to end with this epidemic.
