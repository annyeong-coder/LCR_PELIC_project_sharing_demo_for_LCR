Mandatory military service is a great solution of the countries that is in danger What do I mean by this statement Why it is a great solution for countries that are in danger. This solution can be a strong power for countries that surround be dangerous country therefore it must be powerful in order to make balance with these countries They are a lot of countries which require citizens to enjoy army for specific period. Some Example of these countries are South Korea Israel Switzerland and Egypt. They require people to be in army in the age of 18 to 20 and some countries extend that to 22 or 21. These countries want to protect themselves from their oppositions or from any dangerous thing. This is way it is a great reason Obviously Many countries have plausible reason to impose this rule on its people but The situation is different from country to country as well the geographic reason can make for us a rational reason. For example South Korea which is located between one of new and dangerous country which is North Korea. This country accomplished to get his one ambition nuclear military power that will destroy the relationship and create obstacles of peace with North Korea. So North Korea will try to defend on its country by valid reason.
