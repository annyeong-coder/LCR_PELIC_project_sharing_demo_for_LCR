I had an experience about the snow. I had never seen snow before I came to Pittsburgh. I thought the weather will be colder than I felt. I had prepared myself very well before the winter started. As soon as the snow started to fall I jumped to the window. By the time the snow stopped falling I had been setting beside the window. After that I went outside enjoying the snowy weather but it was not colder than I had thought. I did not feel it will hear me. Because of that I have changed my opinion about the snowy weather.
