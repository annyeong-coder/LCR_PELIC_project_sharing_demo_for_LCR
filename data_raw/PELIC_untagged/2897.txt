There are a lot of important things in my life but most three important things are family my boyfriend and money. My family is really important for me because they raised me up and they always cheer me up. They always care about me. My boyfriend also cheers me up and care about me. So the second one is my boyfriend. We love each other and we have a lot of experiences. These experiences make me stronger. I don't want to live without him. I'm sure that there are no person who can understand me more than him. The third one is money. Maybe all of us need money. If there are money I can buy everything that I need. I don't want to get a lot of money just that I need to live. I need those three things to make my life happy.
