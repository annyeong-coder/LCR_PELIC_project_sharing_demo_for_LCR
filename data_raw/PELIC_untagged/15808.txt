I believe that foreign student s should be allowed to work in the country they are studying in. First reason why I believe that foreign students should to work in country they are studying in is to ensure more finical stability in their lives. Today it is difficult for most foreign students to have finical support. Because they have to pay for there liven the collage tuition and the books feel they have to find other income source. For example my cousin who came from Saudi Arabia to USA for continue his education does not have a scholarship. His waif and his 3 kids were come with him. In the same time he has to be ready for facing any challenge that he would face in the feature. One of these challenges was the money. It is difficult to have family with you and studying by your own money without any handout from your government so he has to find a solution he tried to work as part time but he could not. For this it is very important for the international students to have the opportunity to get a part time job at least to grantee their life stability. The second reason why I believe that foreign students should to work in country they are studying in is to sustain a good economy. It is obvious how these foreign students help economy increasing in many countries. By paying the tuition for the universities and paying the apartments rent for sure help the economy refresh. Thus leave the foreign students work is one of the min factors that helps economy in that country maintain. For instance if we suppose the population in Pittsburgh are 400 000 and the foreign students are 5000 students. I think these percentage will it make deference in Pittsburgh economy. For this reason we should consider foreign students as one of the good factors that help our economy to be great.
