I don't think only trained artists can create art. Of course someone who is not an artist can create art. For example there is a young boy who is making a castle at a beach. Even though the castle was not spontaneous it has meanings. It is the creature of the boy's thought. The meanings could be very simple or complexity. I agree that an artist's art and the boy's art are diverse from each other. However both are the arts.
