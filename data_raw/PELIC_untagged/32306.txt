Topic Women are better parents than men It seems to be true that women are better parents than men at lest when their parenting sons and daughters who are in a childhood. During growing up children need to close caring because their characteristics are usually formed in this term through communicating with their parents about who they are where they came from what they should do and so forth. . Boys and girls want to someone who listens carefully what they say and who gives them tender words which jobs are more appropriate to women. Of course men can assist women to usher their children to a communicating field and sometimes men can play more important roles. However it seems more rational that women are better parents than men during a growing up time.
