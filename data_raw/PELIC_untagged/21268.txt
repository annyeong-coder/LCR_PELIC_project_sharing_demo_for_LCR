My classmate Peggy whose face always has smile. She told me who lives apartment in downtown Pittsburgh is close to ELI. Peggy and Katy both came from Taiwan. They become good friends after in ELI. I think friendship is a relationship that emphasizes sharing each other innermost feeling friends are peoples who know each other behind the soul . I will cherish friendship which we have. I want to hang out with them to the park which is close to school on this week end. After then we will go to ELI night party that is in William Pitt Union building. Everyone who comes to ELT night must bring a traditional food from their country. I want to discuss with girls which food we need bring to the party.
