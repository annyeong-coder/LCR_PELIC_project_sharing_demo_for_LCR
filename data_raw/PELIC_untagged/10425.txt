My bedroom is very small so there isn't too much space. I am a lazy guy who is tired of cleaning his bedroom up. Every time when I go into my bedroom I see a mess in my room and that messes me up. I've never asked girls over because of my bedroom. I've thought over a hange to my room for a long time. I'll take down the old poster and put on a new one. I'll also put every thing back. I think make a change will cheer me up bring me the luck and straighten up every bad thing. I have to try it out right the second. I won't let my room bring me down any more.
