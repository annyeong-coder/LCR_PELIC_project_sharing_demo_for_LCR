My strengths in writing in English are my focus in my work for what I am writing. It is my desire to increase the number of strengths at this time this is the best that I can list. For my weaknesses in writing I feel there are many. I sometimes have difficulties expressing my thoughts in English since my thoughts are based in the romantic languages Spanish and Portugese. It is my goal to arrive to the point where I can compose my thoughts in English as well as the other languages that I can speak.
