Tom Higgins opened a new restaurant at Benson University. He called it the Undergrad Grill and he was very happy when he be able to rent appropriate space on restaurant row. Unfortunately the restaurant failed due to three main causes strong competition money and rules. First of all the competition was more intense than he had predictable. The restaurant was surrounded by many other restaurants. He did not hair a professional cooks so he hired a several student to do the cooking so he lost his chance to compete with the other restaurant. Second Tom started his business with too little money. He did not have enough money to do advertising. He just hair two waitresses to take care of the restaurant. He lost some of his money when he ended up overpaying the workers who did the renovation and painting because he wanted to get the job done as quickly as possible. Third the restaurant has very strange and strong rules for the customers. For example no bare feet no smoking no skate boards no children under age 5 and no take out. The result is his restaurant was doing poorly and the number of his customer was decreasing. In the end it is hard to open a restaurant and Tom was not preparing for it.
