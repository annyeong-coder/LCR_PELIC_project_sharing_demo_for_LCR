I interviewed ANON_NAME_0 about his future plans. After the ELI finishes he will study at university of pittsburgh. He will get a master degree after he studies at university of pittsburgh. He will graduates before he goes back to his country. When he goes back to his country he'll find a job. He will find a job as soon as he buys a house.
