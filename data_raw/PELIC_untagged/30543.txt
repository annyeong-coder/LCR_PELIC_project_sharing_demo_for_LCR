We can not WITHDRAW our traditional lifestyle. It has something to do with our morden life. However If we just stay on a traditional lifestyle we feel ISOLATED and UNEASY through morden life. We already PARTICIPATE social community through internet and cellphone. If we give up these things It means that we REJECT community and convenience in our life. So I would like to live a nontraditional life.
