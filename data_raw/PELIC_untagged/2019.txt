Knowing persons sometimes are better than learning in academic study. When I knew my best friend was the memorable experience for me. I met him three years ago in college where we were studying the same college we met in there and I am admiring this kind of smart people which they are very valuable thing in my life. He has a big knowledge about sciences that really will let everyone be shocked that how he is like that. For example when we were in coffee shop in Saudi Arabia someone has asked him about chemistry and the one was asking is professor in chemistry and then he was shocked of his answer which was perfect answer. Moreover he is acclaimed by people day after day. For example someday he has asked about religions in the world and he was explaining about each religion in the world about things they believe and all people were in that event were shocked that how he could get all information about all religions in the world. However he is not even undergraduate student and he knows all of the science's information. Finally I am very proud of knowing kind of this people which are very valuable to me which also I will get a lot of information by accompanying him.
