I am a person who always tries to be responsible and who does not like irresponsible people. I should acknowledge that I cannot get along with people whose philosophy is to do everything for getting rich. My friends are people whose attitude is close to my ideas about life. I can be a friend of a person who likes music but I can never have a close relationship with a person that betrays others for his welfare. I am the one who tries to have realistic dreams and who likes coffee very much.
