I've ever lost my wallet at the last semester when I went to the point state park. While I was on the excursion ship I just knew that I lost my wallet. I could not do annything. After I disembarked from the ship I ran to find the wallet. But I didn't find my wallet. Finally I went to the main camp in hope of jobs and was surprised that there was my wallet at the main camp which someone picked it up and took it to the main camp. I appreciated it to a person who picked it up. I felt that people in pittsburgh were kind.
