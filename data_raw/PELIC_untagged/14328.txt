Since I've lived here I have been afraid of talking on the phone. Sometimes it brings me down. So when a call comes from a number that I don't know I am afraid to pick it up. Sometimes I can't figure out what people say to me but I kept on asking the person to repeat. Sometimes I have to give up and hang the phone up. The First month I lived here I looked for an apartment and I had to talk with the manager. So at that time my sister helped me out. Also she cheered me up and talked me into having a phone conversation.
