Based on what I learnt in chapter 2 I think that both human and nonhuman have language. In spite of that humans use language in a creative and complex way. On the other hand nonhuman primates use simple language for communication. For example in Koko case we can see that she has improved a language to communicate with humans even though her language is still modest and incomplex. She maybe can create some words as when she combined finger and bracelet to say ring . But I think she is not aware of everything she is saying. In conclusion even if nonhuman primates have a language but their language is not compared to human language.
