When I finished High School I went to Buenos Aires to study medicine. While I was studying at the university I saw in a list the name of my husband. His name is Alejandro Sanz exactly the same name of the singer so I thought who is this silly guy and I felt pity for him because of this ashamed coincidence. Later while I was waiting to do a practice in the hospital he approached me and he started to talk me. He told me how many siblings he has also he told me practically all about his life in fifteen minutes. As a result I thought that he was very strange because he did not know anything about me but he told me all these personal things anyway and in a emergency room. While the time was passing I was realizing that he was so sweet and responsible so I felt completely in love with him. In addition one year after this day we had a daughter and we got married ten years after this day.
