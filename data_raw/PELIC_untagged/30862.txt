My room is brigh. The room always light up by the sunshine to window. So I get up early in the morning. Because the brightness of my room. When I get back from the school my room makes me feel comfortable. And it is easy to move around furnitures and to clean up the room due to small size of room. Also the whiteness cover up the wall in my room however my dress room is too small. So it makes me feel bad. Since I can't tear down the wall so I only hope more space.
