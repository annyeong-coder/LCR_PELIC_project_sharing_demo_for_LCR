A memorial place of my childhood is Karuizawa which is located in center Japan. When I was a child every summer I went there. Karuizawa nestled among mountains which is a famous place as a summer resort is my beloved rural town. My late father whose occupation was a editor of a magazine was so busy that he did not have enough time to play with us except our summer vacation. I really loved the time when I enjoyed with my family. So I always waited for the day when we departed to Karuizawa anxiously. Even my younger sister who was very calm and spoke not so much said to me with bright eyes Tomorrow we are going to go to Karuizawa where we can play a lot at last! In Karuizawa we could ride a horse and we sometimes met a family whom my parents knew well. The pictures that we took there remind me of the good old days. In the picture everybody is smiling happily. It was a crucial period in my life when I could feel affections of my parents.
