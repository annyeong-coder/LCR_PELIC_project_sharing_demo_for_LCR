After reading this text I found several reasonable ideas that supporting the function of smell to choose perfect mates. First according to the text every person has a certain odor type which depended on one's own immuno type. The research shows us the fact that people tend to bond with people whose odor type is different from theirs. This result is related to the general nature's phenomenon genetic instinct people try to make their offspring more strong by instinct like other species on the earth. With the partner who has different odor type and immuno type people can acquire much possibility that give their offspring strong defense systems and diversity. That's also one reason why the women prefer male who has different odor from their own genetic makeup. Second the research on the text insists that smell is the most underrated sense among our senses. Smell is one of the strong methods to find perfect mate. Smell has an access to the basic part of brain directly. Therefore people can decide involuntarily whether someone is a perfect partner or not by smelling. The last reasonable example of function of smelling to find partner is perfume that people choose. The research says that the perfume a person wears can shows more about him or her. It is believed that people tend to choose a perfume what is close to one's own immuno type. Hence according to the text smell can influence our first impressions very much. Although this research on the text is just hypothesis I think it is persuasive enough in that it is based on the scientific facts and biological reserch.
