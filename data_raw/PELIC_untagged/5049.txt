I'm in favor of doing give someone the chance to impress us. As Dr. Schwartz says first expressions are not always everything. Even if we don't feel attracted to the person first we sometimes change our minds and feel like seeing this person again. We had better make a dicision after we know the person's personality as much as we can. On the other hand I can't agree with Dr. Schwartz on the point that we shoud do get specific in our online profiles. I think people tend to be impressed by a person they don't know about well. If we write about ourselves very cleary a person will be satisfied with it and won't try to know any more about us. Therefore I think it's better to keep our feelings values or hobbies secret from the person and make these our secrets clear gradually.
