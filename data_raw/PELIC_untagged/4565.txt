My best day I had a fabulous day yesterday. First I woke up at 7 00 A. M. Then I got prepared to go to school. After that I heard someone knocking on the door when I opened I found my family in front of me. Next I was shocked because I didn't know that they were coming from my country to see me. Then I told them to come in and I made for them a very nice food. They liked it very much. Finally I took them to show them Pittsburgh downtown. That's why that was the best day in my life.
