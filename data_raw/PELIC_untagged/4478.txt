When you come in my bedroom you probably think that it's very simple. Because there are some furnitures in my bedroom. If you open the door you can see the big mirror in front of you. When you turn right there is a bed which has one metrics. To the left there is small desk to the study. Also you can find some book above the desk. It's all of my furnitures. Um. . Behind the wall between door and desk I have small clothes furniture. I just have some clothes in U. S. At the center there is air condition. Sometimes I need air condition because some day very cold while I sleep. Actually I don't live in th U. S. I'm just visit in U. S. For the study English so I don't need many furnitures in my apartment. However recently I try to decorate my room because I have been living alone starting of this semester.
