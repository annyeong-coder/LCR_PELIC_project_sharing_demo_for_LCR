I asked ANON_NAME_0 what's the hot news in China. He told me that the price of meat had increased. I asked him from when the price started increasing. He answered that it started increasing from this April. I asked him why it started increasing from then. He explained to me that many pigs in China got sick and the number of pigs which could be used for food was getting small. He added that in China the price of oil and vegetable was also getting high. However he told me that the price of meat oil and vegetable is still much cheaper than that in the U. S.
