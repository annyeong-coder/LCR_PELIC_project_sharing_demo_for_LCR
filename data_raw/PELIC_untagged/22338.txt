Hi I am ANON_NAME_0. I have been writing in this website since 2005 and I have my own page to introduce myself. I was born in Makkah and I grew up there too. I did many things with my friends. We played soccer climbed a mountain and we swam in the red sea. I ve traveled to Indonesia and Bahrain for many times. I moved to USA before four months. I ve searched for a university to study electrical engineering. I ve been learning English since I came to here. I ve learned many things while I m here like fishing and skiing. Also I met many friends.
