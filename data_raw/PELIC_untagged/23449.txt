A major decision in my life is about entering university. I couldn't enter university just after I had graduated high school. Thus I had to study 1 year more. If only I had studied harder. Unfortunately I couldn't enter the university I targeted. And my major is visual design although I wish I studied jewelry design. Though I didn't like the situation in which I was I had to decide to go university then because if I hadn't go university then I couldn't be in the U. S. If I hadn't made the decision I would have studied for the last year even if I couldn't enter the university I want to go again. Now I think I made a good decision. This 1 year for which I'm in the U. S must be helpful to my future.
