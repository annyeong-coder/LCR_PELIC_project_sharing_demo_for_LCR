Being very busy my dad does not really spend time with the family. Other members of my family including my sisters and mother usually have work or other chores to do. My sisters working in my dad's company wake up very early and leave work late. My dad having little time manages to find time to hike for two hours on most days. On weekends my dad invites everyone including his friends at work to go hike with him. Having a husband who loves to hike my mom is sometimes forced to go hiking with my dad. My sisters having little exercise normally are also forced to go. Being away from my family I am the only one exempt from hiking with my dad.
