The type of language that you use is determined by the context of the communicative situation. Although there is not a specific rule about the language it is implicit in all the cultures that you have to be able to adjust your speech depending on the audience and purpose. In my case I try to speak a formal English because I spend most of my time in ELI where the appropriate language is the academic one. However at home I speak a mix French Spanish English Spanish because it is my mother tongue English because I want to practice it also because it is in my head all the time and French because it is the native language of my fianc n addition with my friends I use an informal short and grammatically wrong English which allows me to communicate quickly and freely. I know that when I speak in this way I am almost negating my ELI learning but I need to use it in order to feel comfortable with this Second Language.
