When I was in high school I used to walk from my house to school. I used to participate in the dance group of my school. Also I used to read comic books. I remember that my favorite comic was Memin . I used to read this comic on the weekend because this comic was in a magazine annex to the newspaper that my father bought on Sundays. In high school I used to wear the uniform of the school. Also I used to play basketball and soccer with my friends in the free time. I used to dream about being a great man. In short when I was in high school I used to do many activities like all teenagers.
