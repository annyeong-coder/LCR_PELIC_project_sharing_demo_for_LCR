When I studied in Germany I wanted to go to England to watch the soccer game which Korean players played. Before we thought about going to England we didn't take any trips. So it was little boring. My friend and I made a plan to go to England and both of us were looking forward to having much fun in there. However neither my friend nor I know we should have exchanged mony Euro to Pound. Actually we needed much money to buy tickets for soccer game and for Eurostar. We didn't worry about anything because we thought we had a lot of money. Unfortunately all of that was Euro and we couldn't use in the U. K at all. After we went back to Germany we talked about that. And many friends who studied with us laughed at us. ANON EMAIL
