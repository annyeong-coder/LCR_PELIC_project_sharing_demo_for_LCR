It was my fantastic trip. I went Cambodia at the summer before last summer. It was the short trip only 3 days and 2 nights. I think I should have stayed there at least a month. I saw many ancient palaces in the Sieam Reab city. The most interested of them was Angkor Wat there is the one of seven wonderful places in the world. It was made from a lot of sandstone bricks but it didn't attract me any more because before I saw Angkor Wat palace I had seen some palaces that were made from a pink sandstone brick but it wasn't as big as Angkor Wat. The our guide told me around there didn't have enough pink sandstone to build the a big palace.
