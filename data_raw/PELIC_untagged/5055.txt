About a year ago I went to a restaurant with my friends. We had already knew that each food of the restaurant was really expensive but we decided to go to the restaurant because it was one of my friends' birthday. I ordered beef stake French fries and coke. When the food was given to me I was very satisfied because its appearance was really good. However shortly after tasting a piece of beef stake I could not help being disappointed. The taste of my beef stake was really awful and French fries seemed to be made a long time ago. After that I ordered a cup of coffee. At first I thought that the taste of coffee would be similar to other restaurants' or coffee shops' one. However even coffee was really tasteless even though I put the sugar and milk properly. Fortunately my friend's birthday party ended successfully. I was happy that he enjoyed the meal we prepared. However it was the worst meal exerience for me.
