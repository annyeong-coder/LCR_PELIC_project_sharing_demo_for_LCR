My bedroom reflects my personality in three ways. First the light color that I use to cover my bedroom with reflects the quietness in my personality. For instance I always use white or beige cover bed. Next I always leave my room clean and order including my bedroom. I think that reflects the organization in my receiving the massages of life. To illustrate I don't like to do many different things in one time. Finally I like to sleep in wide bedroom. In my opinion the broad and expansion reflect the flexibility in treating others and understanding them.
