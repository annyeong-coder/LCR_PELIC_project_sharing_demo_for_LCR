Author Nadine Cohodas has written a new biography of Nina Simone called princess Noire. Nina Simone was a Julliard trained pianist a writer a composer and she became a voice of action and anger. She charts the life of a performer whose music was always an extension of and a response to the world around her. According to Cohodas Simone never had an interest in crossing the racial divide and she wanted to confront it. Her song To Be Young Gifted and Black became a staple of choirs in black schools across the country. Simone didn't see the racial progress so she spent much of her life overseas. In addition to anger of racial issues she alleged unfair compensation for her successful albums. Simone gave her last two performances at Carnegie Hall in the NYC. Cohodas says it wasn't great but everybody was so thrilled to see her. She became a goddess of culture.
