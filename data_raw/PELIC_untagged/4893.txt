My opinion is that it is better to take a position in a company and work for a company instead of to go into business for ourself. Because a company has more benefits than a business for ourself. First you are paid every month. But in a business for ourself your pay is not regular. You are always in risk to be bankruptcy. It really depends on your managing and luck. Second a big company has a very good network system. You can share important information and get information easily. All workers can connect to the company network system and search for cases that happen in the past. In the other side you have to do it for yourself. It is hard to get valuable information. Third a company has a nice group of men system. That is very important in business. You can not only get introduction to an very important worker in a important position but also an important contract. You have more chances instead to do it for yourself. That is my opinion why I think it is better to take a position in a company.
