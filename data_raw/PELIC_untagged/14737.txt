In my opinion the US should pass the National Language Proposal in order to establish a oficial and national language. However I think that the law should not ptohibit the use of other languages in government services if many people who live in this country don't have The English Language as their native language. This situation can produce discrimination for people who cannot communicate well in English as they do in their native language.
