TV is one of the greatest inventions. We can hardly find people who do not have TV in their home. We can not think about our lives without TV. TV may influence our lives in good way but there can be bad impact. TV might make our lives destroy or result repercussion. In my life TV also has great impact on me. For example when I was a student I liked watching TV because the programs were very interesting and exciting. When I was young I was always in front of a TV. But as I grew TV became a problem. I could not stop watching TV even though I was a high school student. Even if I had a test the next day I only watched TV and didn't study. So I got a terrible score. But still I could not realize what I was doing wrong. As a result my school life got messed up. There was a friend 16 years old at that time who watched TV as much as I did. I can't catch up with the classes because I always fall asleep in the classes. TV spoiled my school life she said.
