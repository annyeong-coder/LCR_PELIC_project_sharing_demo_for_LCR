In my opinion this is not the precise word to describe Tan's mother. Being an English speaker with imperfect language does not imply that she is limited in her perception as this word may reflects in a negative way. Obviously there are many evidences in the text which support this argument. First of all Tan claimed that her mothers' expressive command of English belies how much she actually understands. Second she mentioned that she wince when she describes her mother's English as broken or fractured to indicate that she is not convinced to describe her mother's by any of these words. Also she thinks limited is even worse because it may be interpreted as having a limited perception. Finally the most important evidence among all is that Tan's mother was reading her stories and criticizing her writings. In fact she said so easy to read .
