I met marwa during the summer holiday at the beginning of the year in Washingnton plaza swimming pool. At that moment I felt about her as something entire in my life. Her parents especially her mother encouraged the relationship. We spend mush time togethar. We were at Kennywood. We were playing many games. And we were doing many activity. We were living with each other befoere I went to my family.
