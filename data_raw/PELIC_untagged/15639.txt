While I was studying in the graduate study to get an MsC I was thinking about continuing my study to hold PhD degree. And I decided to complete my study. If hadn't studied hard I wouldn't've gotten an MsC. This factor gave me a good opportunity to continue my study which made me came to USA. If I hadn't decided to continue my study I couldn't've gotten scholarship. I hope I will get the PhD degree and go back to my country. I wish all my friends who were studying with me in under graduate study could get an MsC to be together in USA.
