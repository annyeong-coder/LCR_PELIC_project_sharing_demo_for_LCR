Seven years ago when I was attending an engineering school I had to decide which feild I want to study after finishing the general subjects. I was looking forward to attend the architecture school. I have had the potential to be a good architect I love math and art classes. Unfortunatily there was no achitecture school in the university where I was studying. Therefore I chose the civil department. After the first term in the civil school I got bored there was no math or art classes. All the subjects that I was studying were subtract. So I decided to move to another university. That was a crucial decision in my academic life. I wasn't reluctant to make the dicision. I moved to a new university which was in another city far away from my hometown.
