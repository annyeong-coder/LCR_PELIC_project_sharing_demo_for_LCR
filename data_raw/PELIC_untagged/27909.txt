The essay made me think about the relationships that I have with things near from me the sofa that I sit on the car which I use everyday the doorman who greats me every time I see him. Each one of these relationship and others ties me in somehow and each one affect the other one and my life. I like to think about metaphors the great power that language move between the words. How a metaphor shin in our minds and how I feel good win I create one even by mistake which happens a lot with me.
