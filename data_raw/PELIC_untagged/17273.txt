In my opinion an international student must meet many problems which sometimes will became their pressure such as dealing with all kinds of food cultures different languages and changeable climatic. First of all all of intrnational students come from different countries therefore when they come to America all kinds of food cultures will affect them. For example the first thing is food culture difference. In Ameica there are many of the fast food such as subway Teco Bell but in our country we don't have. Since we study in U. S. We have to use it. In addition all of the international students have their own language. Therefore if we want to communicate with each other we have to speak English including go nemperature is low negative degrees fahrenheit I can't imagine how can I go to school in that kind of whether. In sum international student must meet many problems but they have to learn how to overcome their problems and learn how to live in their pressure. It goes without saying that they must be grow up quickly when they graduate.
