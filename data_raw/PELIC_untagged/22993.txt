In the past China and India were under foreign domination so their economy and life expectancy were more lower than UK and the USA. After they are independent they are rising very quickly and maybe they will catch up with western world in 2048. The biggest problem in China and India is inequalities. And they should develop social investments in health education and infrastructure. Every country should avoid war because that always pushes human beings backward.
