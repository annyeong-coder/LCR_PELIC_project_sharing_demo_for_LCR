Before living in Pittsburgh I had already gotten different experiences by traveling and living in the U. S. Such as cooking by myself taking a bus to school and driving a car with a diverse habit. I had been traveling and living in America such as Cleveland Teaneck and Boston since I graduated from the university. I had never cooked before traveling oversea. I learned how to cook by myself because it is too expensive to eat in a restaurant in America. Moreover I had never taken a bus to school before I lived in the U. S. I could not afford to buy a car so I was taking a bus to sxhool and everwhere. However it costs you a lot to own a car renting the car is cheaper in the weekend in America. Therefore I rented the car during the weekend. When I drove on a road in Pittsburgh I had never driven so slowly. Living in America gives me several new experiences.
