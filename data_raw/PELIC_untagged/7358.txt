Caral which is the oldest city in the world shows us the evidences of its culural aspect. First of all caral might have a role as a major trade center for the region from the Amazone to the Andes because some plants and necklaces which came from other places were founded in Caral. Second Caral might have the class cistinctions. The trade became so rich that a elite group who didn't participate in production of food appeared. And they could become priests and planners builders and designers. At last farmers in Caral might exchange their cotton for shellfish and dried fish with fishermen from coast to the west. A large fishing net discovered on Peru's coast which turned out to be ad old as Caral and the great amount of cottonseeds fibers were the evidences of exchanging them.
