I met eunji while I was traveling in Austria. I was looking around Mozart's house in Salzburg when she saw me. She was also traveling. When she asked me if I am Korean I noticed she is Korean. To meet a Korean girl in Europe was so glad to me. So we got along while we were traveling in Salzburg. We decided to eat lunch in a famous restaurant. When we ate lunch together we went to other tourist attraction.
