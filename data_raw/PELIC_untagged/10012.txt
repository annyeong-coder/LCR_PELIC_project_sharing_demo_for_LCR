Last summer I and my friends wanted to take a vacation but we didn't have much money. We decided to take a short trip to visit the famous Lebanese mountain The Black Mountain because it was the only trip that we could afford. I made all the plans. I decided that we should share the expenses for food and gas equally and that each one should bring some extra clothes because the weather at high altitude is usually cold. When we arrived the weather was pleasant and we enjoyed the fresh air. When we reached the top of the mountain we saw a beautiful sight. The colors of the sunset were yellow red and gold. We relaxed and enjoyed the view. We could see many trees hills and valleys. We had a lot of fun. We stayed for three days but three days weren't enough we wished that if we could spend much time there but we thanked God that we didn't have any troubles.
