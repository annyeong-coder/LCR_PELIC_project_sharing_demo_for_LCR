I used to live in a small town in Saudi Arabia. I graduated from The King ANON_NAME_0 University. First I worked for the private hospital Then I left the work in the hospital. After a while I got a job in the university as a teacher assistant. The university give me a scholarship to the USA. So I used to be a teacher. I used to sleep early in the night. I used to play soccer. I used to go camping with my friends. Today I am living in Pittsburgh PA USA. I am studying English at Pittsburgh University. I have been here for four months. I am trying to make a new friends. The people here are lovely and supportive. Usually I wake up at 6 00. Then I go to a cafe and read some newspapers. After that I go to the classes at 8 30 a. M .
