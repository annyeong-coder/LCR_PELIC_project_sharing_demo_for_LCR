Very few people can congratulate without envy a friend who has succeeded . This quotation means that the majority of people are jealous of others and a small population really feels satisfaction of the others succeed. That is my case. 9 Years ago when I was at the Surcolombiana University where I studied my career I met Yina who is my best friend. At that time when we were studying we began a solid friendship based in the trust. Along years our friendship grew a lot and my triumphs which could be smaller or bigger were celebrated for her. In my case I feel so fortunate to count on my friend. In our friendship don't exist envy which is a bad feeling or any other negative force. Friendship that is a great feeling between 2 persons who are join by the respect the trust and the cooperation among others is the most important benefit from the interaction between humans.
