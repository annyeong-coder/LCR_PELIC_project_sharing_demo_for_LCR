There is Korean friend that I met a few days ago in Pittsburgh. He picked me up after my classes and we went to play the soccer. We were playing the soccer for an hour. Then I visited his house to have the dinner. He was cooking the steak the Korean food for me. I was really happy. I talked with him while we were having the dinner. His daughters were playing the computer game at that time. After that we drank the wine and we were talking about the U. S life.
