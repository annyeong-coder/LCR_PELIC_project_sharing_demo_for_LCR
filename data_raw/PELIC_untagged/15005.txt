My bedroom is a special place. It is a rectangle. When I walk in the door the first thing is two windows in the wall. It has a view of the basketball court and high school. Sometimes look at the them I think that I used to play basketball with friends. My bed is next to a window. On the left wall is dresser and there is a clock on the wall above the dresser. The table is between the bed and dresser. I most like laptop is on the table.
