I agree with the author that children will lose their interest or curiosity when they reach at the third or fourth grade. It is because they have to handle with heavier schedules and more subjects according grads in school getting higher. Also they have to handle and finish many things at a time. More restriction which restrains free choices of children will be given from instructors or parents. These kinds of school environment will give a sense of pressure and burden to children which eventually cause to lose children's own interest and curiosity in learning.
