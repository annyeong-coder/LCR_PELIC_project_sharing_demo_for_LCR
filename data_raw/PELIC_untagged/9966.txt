I have some adveices to tell you about learning Engilsh. First you can read some articles that you are interested. Second you need to listen to more English and you can lisnen to radios which speak in English. You also can watch TV and movies in your free time that is a good way for your listening and you wouldn'd be under lots of press. Then you try to write some paragraphs with correct words and grammer. Next you have to practice to speak English. It is very important to talk to someone because that is the reason why you learn English. Finally follow the suggestion what I say and do it. In addtion one thing you must remember practice makes perfect .
