Bermuda Triangle Christopher Columbus sailed in the Atlantic Ocean with no problems. However the mystery of Bermuda Triangle began in 1945 with the flight 19 which never ended. Flight 19 was made up of five training aircrafts who had disappeared in a strange way. No wreckage was found and nothing was heard about any of the vanished aircrafts. A rescue aircraft was sent to find the missing aircraft but it vanished too in twenty minutes from arriving to the target point which was in Bermuda Triangle. Since that time many flights and ships were missed in the same area. Nevertheless no clear explanation had been given so far. People who were puzzlingly missed in Bermuda Triangle are not considered dead neither alive.
