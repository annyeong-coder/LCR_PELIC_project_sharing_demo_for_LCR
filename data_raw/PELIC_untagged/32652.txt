A captivating place you need to go when you visit my hometown is the beginning of the Great Wall which has been called the old leader . The name means dragon head. It was built in 1368 to against invaders from the sea. According to legend it is a big challenge to build the old leader because the building is in the sea. The foundation of the building is sand. People finished some project in several days by hard work and then tides come. Usually a high tide would submerge the walls and damaged them immediately. When the tide had gone people had to build it again. Has such one time a chief had seen this situation and an idea come to his mind. He told the workers to put some huge iron pot upside down and arranged them one by one. And then they built walls behind them. Amazingly after a violent tide people found the wall survived. Nowadays if you go to the old leader maybe you will perceive some huge pots in the foot of the wall.
