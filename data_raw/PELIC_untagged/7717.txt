The view out of window at my home I see surprised things out of window at my home. Now I live in a apartment of Shadyside. When I look out the view out of window directly I can see parking garage and many cars. It is very boring to me. The cars are always in same place because they get own district. One yellow Newbittle is located in left corner always. White Toyota is next to it. Black Sonata made by Hyundai is front of entrance of garrage. Ferrai is middle of my head but garrage. You will wonder where surprised things is It is UPMC embrance. I am scared due to it.
