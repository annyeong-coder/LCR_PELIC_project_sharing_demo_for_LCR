I can't forget the city where I grew up because I lived there for 16 years. I had good time when I was child. I had many friends who were same age with me. There had many small house where our lived. I remember she cried the day when she fall over by herself. There were many people lived in where it was not big village. I saw there had big changed when I visited to my friend in there. Now maybe there have a lot of big houses or apartments where I still remember.
