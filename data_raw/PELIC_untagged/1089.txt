When I was an undergraduate freshman student I was studying in Engineering. I spent most of time on playing computer games and chatting with people. Last week in September I had final exam. Of course I shouldn't have spent most of time on computer. I needed more time to study before my exam but I also play computer. I should have studied hard before the exam. I asked my teacher for postponing the exam but he refused. I ought not to have asked my teacher and should have tried to read books. Two weeks later I received my grade. It's bad for me and my parents and I were very upset. My parents made me study four hours per day but that was a terrible thing because I couldn't concentrate for long time. My parents shouldn't have made me study too much. They also didn't allow me to use computer for 3 months. I thought my parents ought to at least have warned me about using computer.
