In this talk Prof. Thomas Hofweber surveyed three major positions in the philosophy of time all of which are positions about the question of what time is that is which aspects of our experiences of time such as the direction in time time's passage the openness of future and so on are real and which are illusion. According to John MacTaggart a philosopher in early 20th century there are two different conceptions of time the A series conception and the B series conception. The proponents of the A series conception claims that time is divided into past present and future whereas the proponents of the B series conception regard time as just an ordering of events. Based on these two conceptions there are three major positions about the nature of time. The first position four dimensionalism accepts only the B series conception and asserts that time is the 4th dimension and the world is four dimensional that is three dimensional space and time and thus the experiential distinction between past present and future is not real. The second position the moving now conception accepts both conceptions and claims that time is ordered events and divided into past present and future. The third position presentism accepts only A series conception and maintains that the B series conception is illusion and only the present is real. Hofweber told that positions have strong and weak points and also emphasized the importance of analyzing tense expressions in natural languages.
