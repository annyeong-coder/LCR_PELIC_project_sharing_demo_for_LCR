When I was in my country I had a car. I went to school every morning many students stood in bus station. And I used to give them ride. It called 'CAR Fool. ' Sometime someone who used my car to go to school give me some money that was lower than bus fee. However it was helpful for me because I could save money although it wasn't big money. Also I was going to that way anyhow. If all of them use own car each other it is consuming amount of oil that is imported from foreign county and is limited. In addition due to oil our county has to pay the consequence of importation. In conclusion CARFOOL is one of good method that reduces the amount of oil I use and helps nation's economy as one of citizens.
