If you want to get a driver's license in Pittsburgh you must follow these steps. First you can get a driver's license manual in the State Office Building. Then you need to do some paper work. For example you need to submit your application to get a form that it is your doctor's certificate about your health and to provide 2 envelops that they show your name and address. Of course you need to bring your photo ID or passport. Second you must pass a test on computer for driver's license permit. Next you can buy or borrow a car to practice your driving skill. Don't forget you must drive with your friend who already has a driver's license. Then you can take a test on the road. You will get the real driver's license if you have passed the test. Good luck!
