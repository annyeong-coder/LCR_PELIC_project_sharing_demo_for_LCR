2. And my dog barked toward me. He looked hungry and wanted to go bathroom. The dog and cat made noisy. I could not eat breakfast because I should have fed my pet and picked dog up the bathroom. When I went outside to take my car I realized that I was wearing a pajama. I had to change my clothes. Finally I left my house. I was thought that it was over nightmare. However when I saw traffic jam I could feel frustrating. 3. On my way to work I decided to take a shortcut through on old part of town. When I took a shortcut there was horrible car accident. I could not move anywhere. I could not wait. I decided I parked on the way and I ran toward a main street. I could catch a taxi. However I came into my boss's head.
