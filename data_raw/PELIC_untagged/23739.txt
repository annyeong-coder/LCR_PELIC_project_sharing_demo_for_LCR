A friend in need is a friend indeed. This proverb means that when I have a problem my true friends will stay with me. All my other friends will suddenly have no time for me. When I am in trouble I will find out people who my real friends are in need. For example when I was working as an operating room nurse I caused the medical malpractice that left a piece of gauze in a patient's body. I counted the gauze. Then I complete discouragement. I got a lot of encouragement from my friend who was also my colleague. She proposed a solution for the issue which took an X ray before patients leave the operation room. Also she explained her feeling that was more important to wait until my mind was refreshed. She is still my real friend whose words did offer me comfort so I sincerely thank her.
