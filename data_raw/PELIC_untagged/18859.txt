My piano teacher was a big help to me when I was a highschool studet. She is so strict to teach the piano. So she got me to do practice a lot. She had me try to participate some competition I had no time to relax with my friends in my youth. Thnaks to her I was able to be graduated from university. She made me scare averytime but now I thank for her encouraging me to be practoce a lot.
