Many parents have been debating about the best way of educate their children. Most of the children are attending public schools whereas others are studying in their homes which known as Home Schooled Children. Parents believe that the public schools have a good impact on the child learning more than the home schools which is totally wrong. Limitless time at home schools provide an opportunity to teach the child more and spend more time in the difficult points. In one hand more time means more knowledge which is the most important component of the learning process. On the other hand spending more time teach your child must gives you an idea about the child skills and interests. The quality of teaching is a major factor which can be affected be the number of students in learning process. In another words there is a direct correlation between the number of students and learning. To illustrate this point teaching one student is distinct than teaching a full class of students whom may disturb classes and make the teacher nervous. Some parents may say social interaction in necessary to improve the children social interaction skills which will reflect on the child personality and communication skills. This point has some merit however a fundamental objection to this argument is that children could learn bad behaviors and face the peer pressure which is more important than social skills that can be learned from other children outside the schools. For example the drugs often start by a bad friend or watching this bad behavior in some place which may be the school. In conclusion many reasons made the parents prefer home schools than public schools. In fact this is totally true and many arguments have been supporting that. In future we will see more home schools and I believe that those schools will be the first choice if parent want to educate their children in a perfect manner.
