Last year took place the most important racial reunion of the world that was in Durban. Countries such as Brazil United States india and South Africa participated this meeting as being the most relavant countries due to their vast racial relation or their enormous discrimination. The European Continent was also present. Some people allege that this international meeting that was useful among other things to disccus a specific affirmative action failed. These people claim that United States abandoned the reunion and India did not accepted that its racial and social classification is a type of discrimination then it did not hold positive outcome. Even though these negative elements occurred black movements from Brazil have a distinct opinion. That was beneficial due to large disuccsion emerging in throughout Brazil.
