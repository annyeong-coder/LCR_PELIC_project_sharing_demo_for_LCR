When I worked in Japan I experienced excellent hospitality at a Japanese restaurant. It was my anniversary for my salary that I went to the Japanese restaurant with my girlfriend. The Japanese restaurant was located in Tokyo and it was famous for Sukiyaki a Japanese dish in the Japanese steamboat style. Whereas I knew that the Japanese restaurant cost much money I was interested in taste. I ordered the most expensive Sukiyaki so I was so impressed about this meal. Beef was tender green onion was fresh some tofu was juicy. Also rice regarded as side of Sukiyaki was cooked in order to suit for beef. Thus we enjoyed eating a delicious dish. In addition the server in the restaurant was so polite. When we enter the restaurant he took our coats in order to avoid being wrinkled. As soon as I asked the server to bring a towel and a new chopstick he brought them. He had never interrupted our conversation while we enjoyed talking moreover he conveniently served a few glasses of water. When I checked he brought our coats to our booth and he vested them for us. Finally when we go out the restaurant he sent off us and deeply bowed. Therefore I spent the most comfortable time at the restaurant.
