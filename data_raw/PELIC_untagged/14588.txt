Next semester I'm going to complete my studying at English Language Institute University of Pittsburgh . Within these months I'll try to get the TOEFL and GRE I may register in Kaplan for preparation the TOEFL after end of this semester. When I finish and get the exams I am going to move to Ohio because my university is there. But I might stay in Pittsburgh if I can get acceptance of Pittsburgh of University because I like and adapt with it. Although Case Western Reserve University is stronger than University of Pittsburgh I will try to get admission. I may spend the next summer in my country with my parents in fact I miss them and they miss me. During my study in the United States I am going to visit many states and entertainment places. I expect I will spend beautiful years in this country.
