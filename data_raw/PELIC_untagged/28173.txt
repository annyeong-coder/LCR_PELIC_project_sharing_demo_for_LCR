Actually I don't like this kind of novel because I felt that this was his self satisfied thought. This story is written from only his perspective I know this is a personal essay though. I like the novel which is written from a objective viewpoint. When I read a novel I like to see the whole story from above. On the other hand a personal novel gives me one person's ample information and it prevents me to think in a different way. However when I watch a movie I like the movie which focuses only one person as a movie which shows a lot of people in one time because it sometimes more impressive.
