The story is about what I experienced during my first flight to America last year. What made me so nervous was the stress of uncertain situation. In the first two hours of my flight I could hardly go to sleep because of the tenseness. After a while an airline hostess came to ask me and the Japanese passenger behind me what we would like to order for dinner. The airline hostess asked chicken or beef and then the passenger behind me replied Kitchen! . What made me laugh was the airline hostess's reaction I realized that she really wanted to laugh but she covered it with a big taut smile. In the rest of my trip the Japanese passenger behind me rang the service ring several times for help. Though it was funny that he spoke strange English and used funny gestures what impressed me the most is that he did not afraid to be embarrassing. This trip taught me that everybody has something he cannot handle and that is why people should ask somebody else for help.
