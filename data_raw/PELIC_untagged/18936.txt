About obesity I reccomend educating children at school. They need to learn about their own health in future. To maintain healty life they have to know about restricting to take a high calorie food. For example they should stop drinking soda and eating potato chips or french fries. Furthermore I advise them to exercise regularly and I suggest increasing the number of a gym class at school.
