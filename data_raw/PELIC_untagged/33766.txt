No one wants to be sad. According to the longman dictionary Sadness is '' feeling unhappy because something unpleasant has happened. '' Sadness causes bad emotions and depression. There are a lot of causes for sadness and Iam going to talk about the three major causes of sadness. They are loss failure and lack of health. The first cause is loss which reflect many aspects For example loss of family friend parents and job. If you loss any of these valuable things you will be sorrow. This sorrow will cause some troubles like depression and isolation from society. Person like to stay alone and doed not feel to communicate with others. In this case people should be patient and try to get over these troubles. I lost my friend when I was 20 years old. It was terrible moment but Iam fine now because Iam trying to forget everything. The second reason of sadness is failure. Each one avoids all types of failure. For example failure of life marriage or business. Some people have wisdom and try to learn from their failure . They consider their failure as lesson for them to identify their errors and correct them in the future. The third reason of sadness and from my perspective an important cause of sadness is lack of health. We understand value of health and people without health can not live happy and satisfied lives even if they are wealthy. If we are not careful about our health we would suffer from health problems and that make us unhappy. Because illness for example cancer kidney failure and other psychological sick such as homesickness and addiction make person feel sad unpleased and pessimistic . To sum up people should face sadness with a strong patience and learn from these difficult conditions. If they learned from sadness they would feel comfortable optimestis and tolerant.
