Don't count your chickens before they hatch. I remember a saying in my culture that has a similar meaning. It says If you look too far away you'll tire. So I have a story that reminds me of this saying. One day before I came to the USA I was thinking about what I'll do in the future. I was thinking many ideas about what I'd like to do. First I want to go to Canada or the USA. Second I want to study. After that I want to get a good job. Next I want to buy a bike. Before I marry I want to buy a farm. Then I want to marry a beautiful girl and I want to be a father to five children three boys and two girls . Finally I would like to be happy forever. So when I remember that saying I wake up from my dreams and I say to myself If you look too far away you'll tire. It means do what you want step by step and don't dream too much.
