My name is Zahra'a and I come from Qatif Saudi Arabia. I enjoy reading literature of all cultures around the world to learn more about the East and West. Also I like to listen to classic music paint with watercolors and read stories to children. I have been in Pittsburgh for three weeks ago but as much as I love being in this city I cannot get used to live far away from the sea. Recently I was thinking of taking a special English course in academic writing. I am sitting on my table now drinking coffee listening to music talking to my sister and typing my homework.
