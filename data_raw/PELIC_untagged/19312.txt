Studying abroad has always been one of the biggest challenges that students face. Most of the students who leave their home countries to pursue tuition in foreign countries encounter many hurdles or hiccups especially when they first arrive these problems could be fund related or about the time given to them to obtain an admission or learning the new language. Students who pay for tuition using their personal funds might find some difficulties due to the differences in currency exchange rates for example in Syria the exchange rate for dollar is 1 50 so if a semester costs 10 000 it's gonna be 500 000 S. P which is really a lot of money because it takes an average Syrian worker about 3 years to make the same amount. As for language issues some students attend language classes to improve their skills in order to get good TOEFL scores which is a prerequisite for admission into American universities. Besides working on academic language comes the ability to interact with people in society which is needed for students to take care of daily life details. Most international students who are sponsored by their governments get a limited period of time to get admitted to a university which forms an extra pressure but on the other hand this could be a stimulus that motivates them to work hard and meet other admission requirements such as GRE GMAT and LSAT so that they seize the opportunity of achieving their educational goals. It is truly important that universities help international students to adjust to the new life and cope with obstacles in order to accomplish the purpose they come for and that could be a major turn in their lives.
