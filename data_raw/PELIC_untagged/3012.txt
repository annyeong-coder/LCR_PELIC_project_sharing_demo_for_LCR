Center One child policy in China Indent One child policy in China is necessary and helpful in recently 50 years at least. Most people in China must abide by the one child policy in China and most of them understand the reason and obey that but a foreigner who doesn't know the reason of the policy can't accept it. In 1940's to 1960's the population in China had a huge expansion without any control. During the 3 years of national diseases from 1969 to 1972 many people were not able to get enough food and some of them lived in the shortage. Solving the food problem is the most important things at that time also some experts gave the government some advice about potential hazard if we let the population gradually inflation. The number of the population became 3 times more than the number of the population before we found the new country. So far the population has had a high birthrate even though the one child policy has preformed for more than 30 years. The experts said the population of China is going to surpass more than 1. 5 Billion in 2010. That will cause a lot of social problems for us. For example the life space becomes narrow. In some big city such as Beijing and Shanghai the most of the people live in the high building with a small room and a high renting or purchase. The price of house is incredible. The education problem let many good students no chances go to college. Found more universities and control the pollution both is urgent. In addition the new problem happens now that is employment problem. Many students accomplished their education and try to find a job but the amount of the required are much lower than the amount of the applied. Therefore controlling the population in China is a way to help people raise their life quality and keep the social environment stably. Maybe after 100 years the population may be low and some family may want to have their second and third child they may not. One child policy is needed to insist for a long time.
