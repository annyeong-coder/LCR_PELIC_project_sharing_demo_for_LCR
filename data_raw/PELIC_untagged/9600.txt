I will finish the ELI semester in April then I will have the spring vacation. I am going to travel to a tourist attraction with my girl friend and friends. Now my girl friend go to NY. She will return to here in Sunday then we are going to talk about vacation plan. Maybe we are going to leave in Medford. I live in the Eastern State but I wish to live in the Westurn State. I heared Medford is famous for wine. My girl friend's major is wine so she will study about wine in Medford. I amd going to go to Las Vegas. When I live in Korea I often hear Las Vegas is fantastic city. I am going to tarvel to Disneyland. When I was young boy I really want to go there. I'm looking forward to come to Spring vacation.
