I'll be a pharmaceutist. I am studing in America because I'm ready for my future. After finish my last semester in E. L. I I'm going to apply to C. C. A. C cumunity college because tuition of CCAC is cheaper than other universities and I'll be able to save money a lot. I will study in CCAC for two years after that I will transfer to University of Pittsburgh which has good medical school in America. If I transfer to University of Pittsburgh I will get chance to study pharmacy for four years. After graduate from U. Ptt maybe I will get a job in Pittsburgh then I will make a lot of money for my future family and parents. When I turn 33 years old I will get married with a beautiful woman. After two or three years we will have a lovely baby who look like my wife. Not me I am going to try make a lot of money and when I turn 65 years old I will retire and enjoy my beautiful life with my wife.
