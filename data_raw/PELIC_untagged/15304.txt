We already knew that every country has many problems. We cannot pick up all problems and their effects. If we did that process we would stay up all night for many days. Therefore I want to focus on the effects of a social and an economic problem. A social and an economic problem have had several important effects on my country. First I there are three effects of a social problem. For example people started to build more hospice hospitals buildings for seniors or the retired. Next we could say that one of the major effects of the social problem is increased crime rate. The crime came from not a severe action like murder but an essential desire to eat like a grocery store thief. Third the effect is decreasing the number of children. Because many women have more chances to work and become more independent they have thought living alone is better than a marriage. That is why the birth rates are too low. On the next stage there are also three aspects of an economic problem. First of all the most serious problem in economic is a growing unemployment rate. Due to the global depression many workers are laid off from their work place. In addition it is too difficult for many young students to get a job. Second many small companies and some of global corporations are bankrupted. For example many construction companies were already bankrupted and merged by other corporations. Third as a fundamental problem whereas the rich are getting richer the poor are getting poorer. The world is not just for rich people but for everyone. In conclusion we got to know that there are many effects of a social and an economic problem in my country. However there are no countries in the world without a social and an economic problem. I think the most important thing is realizing what we have to do. It is a problem not of person but of everyone. We have to go through and overcome these problems.
