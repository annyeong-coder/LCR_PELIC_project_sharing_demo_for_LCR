My Life's Before and After Marriage There is a little change in my life before and after marriage for sure it is for better. Before my marriage I used to sleep alone and I never used to weak up in the morning by myself. I used to be carefree For example I never used to take care about washing clothes and dish washing but now I think I need to get used to it. I used to be quite but now I think I'm getting to used to be more active and funny so now I'm happier than before.
