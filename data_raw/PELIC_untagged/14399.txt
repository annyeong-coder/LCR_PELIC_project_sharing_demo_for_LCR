The house my grandmother where my mother grew up is the place where I used to visite 20 years ago when was younger. I always remember from my childhood that I had good times. I remember one time when I was 10 old year had a big party and all my families got together. My aunt who is sister da minha mother was so happy because was the first time that all our family to got together. I played a lot with my cousin who is my best friend now. I miss the house of my grandmother.
