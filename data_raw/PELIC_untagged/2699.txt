Center My House in Thailand indent My house in Thailand is magnificent and luxurious. When you walk pass though a gilded aluminum gate which is the main entrance of the house you will be on the long and wide shiny marble pathway. There are white and red rose gardens filled with thousands of vibrant roses on both sides of the road. Refreshed with oriental scent of flowers and summer breeze you are a bee flying over the meadow of roses. When you walk pass the fountain with a statue of jumping dolphins nearby the rose garden in front of you lies the gigantic Roman style mansion. As you enter the door you will stand in the splendid main hall. You will feel like you are in the museum because of the paintings and ancient armors around the wall. On your right there is a cozy air conditioned living room with 2 windows with golden edged curtains. In this room you can sit on a large comfortable sofa while watching wide screen plasma TV and savoring jasmine hot tea in silver teacup. In front of you is the opulent dining room. The round oak dining table is compacted with 12 quilted armchairs. The candlelight on the table is the gleaming stars. On your right behind the wall is my bedroom. I have a big bed which makes you feel like you are lying on cotton. I used to sleep and relax in my bedroom when I was in Thailand. However now I am in Pittsburgh. My new apartment does not look like my house. I like it though.
