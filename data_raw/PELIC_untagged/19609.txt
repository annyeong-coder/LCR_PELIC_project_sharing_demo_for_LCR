The previous weekend was a three day weekend but unfortunately I could not go out and have fun. That was due to many reasons I cannot say them now but because I do not want to give an ambiguous answer I will reveal the underlying reason that is I will take the TOEFL next week. Therefore I had to stay home to enhance my English skills to thrive at the test. I hope you do not mind that I would like to take the chance and say that I am not coming to school on Thursday and Friday due to the same reason.
