Money is the root of all evil. People always believe money is able to obtain anything. Sometimes we want too many things but we don't have enough money. If we can't control ourselves the things will become evil. For example more and more people like the famous brands that always are too expensive but not all people have money to buy the famous brands. At this time some people use the credit card to buy brands but they aren't able to pay money to the bank and they must do it by the reason money will make a lot of problems and many evil things. Finally we need to know that if we can't control ourselves the greed will let money become the root of all evil.
