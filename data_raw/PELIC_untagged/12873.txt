According to a Reader's Digest investigation millions of children on five continents are being lured into a nicotine addiction by U. S. Cigarette makers. Why do so many world's children begin to smoke Because of the American cigarettes' advertising they are lured into smoking in the name of the U. S. Itself. For them smoking is sophisticated. Though the cigarettes companies know that smoking is one of the leading cause of premature death they are promoting smoking among the world's children not only on TV but also in public space or many sports scenes to appeal to young generation. Besides the US has low smoking rate 25 5 other counties' smoking rates has increased. If you want to stop this outrage write a letter to the President to ask him to stop helping the tobacco companies open cigarettes markets overseas. I think that we can't eliminate the advertising of American cigarettes. Because some events always need good sponsors. Then in my opinion governments of each countries should place a public advertising for especially adolescents that smoking could be cause of death and it should not be sophisticated. In Japan under 20 year old people can't buy cigarettes. They need evidence when they buy it. In England the cigarettes are very expensive more than 5 so young children can't reach them and you find a stating You may die because of smoking on the tobacco box. To protect world's children from cool American cigarettes' advertising we should contend with the U. S. Cigarettes business.
