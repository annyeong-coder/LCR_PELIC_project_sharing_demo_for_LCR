We have spring break next week. I and my frinds we have plan to travel out of Pittsburgh. Maybe we will spend the vacatihon in several cities in United State. Our car need to fix. My friend told me it could be ready on next Saturday. We will travel to Indiana Naplis first we might be there on Sunday. May not need to stay for a long time in Indiana Napolis we might go early from the city to Chicago we going to stay in Chicago for three days. We could be back to Pittsburgh on next Thursday. I hope we will get a nice trip and save.
