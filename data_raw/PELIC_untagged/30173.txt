Once there was a TV program that introduces two families. The reason that these two families were introduced was because of their particularity of their children's education. That is called homeschooling also called home education or home learning . Homeschooling is one kind of teaching method that the children who get education by their parents at home instead of going school. It may be true that there might be some limitation of acquiring knowledge when their parents' knowledge or education skill is not enough to teach however in many other reasons such as parents concerning about their children's safety while they are in school homeschooling is worthy to consider. I think it's time for the parents to take a serious consideration of teaching at home.
