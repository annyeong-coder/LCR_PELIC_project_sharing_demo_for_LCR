No I havn't. I think I can't try freediving because it is very dangerous. I think it would be like diving deeply in water without oxygen tanks so I have to hold my breath and stay underwater without oxygen for long peroid. I face diffculty to how I can swim in water shallow but how can I dive in a depth of water for me it is like suiciding.
