Personal success cooking well One of the things that I 'm good at is cooking. I think I can cook well because the follow 3 reasons. First I really love to eat delicious food. People in my hometown always say the person who likes eating can cook very well. I think it's reasonable. Second the food or snacks can really make your mouth water and have very different kinds in my county. When we went out to eat and found a wonderful dish we always ask the cooker how to cook it. Then we practiced at home. Lastly I have a useful cook book. The recipes in the book are easy and simple it's suitable for lazy people like me. I don't cook frequently but if I want I can cook very well.
