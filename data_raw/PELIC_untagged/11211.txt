I think the United States athletes are the best at the Olympic events. The events are skiing gymnastics track and field swimming and wrestling they are the best because they have alot of support from the people and companies and government . The United States athletes are committed and they have all the resource good food good life and alot of attention . I think the important things is peas of mind.
