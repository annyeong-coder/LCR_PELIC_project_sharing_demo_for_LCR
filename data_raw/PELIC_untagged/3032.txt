The cultural expectations of success for females in my country Compared to males people expect females to contribute more to their own family than working in my country. According to my traditional society education there are considered the three types of obedience the father before marriage the husband after marriage and the son after the death of husband and the four virtues morality proper speech modest manner and diligent needlework. There are the cultural expectations of success for females. It means if a female can do as much to assist a male she is regarded as a successful woman. Moreover it is important to a woman gets marry than to have a high education or good position. When she gets married to someone the elder members of her family would consider her marrying a rich man who has houses cars higher education and can make a lot of money. For example I was born in a conservative and traditional family. When I was 25 years old I got a master's degree. Besides my parents all of the elder members at my family thought I was eligible for marriage. They wanted me to marry an eligible man they liked. I rejected this idea and got a good position in my country. Although I think I am successful in my life so far the elder members of my family do not agree with me. As my uncle told me I should get married and follow the three types of obedience and the four virtues as his daughters do. To sum up more and more people who born in my country want to ignore these cultural expectations of success for females but the social education still keeps on teaching children these conventions. Even if these cultural expectations of success for females are hard to change nowadays it will be changed sooner or later by the increasing feminism.
