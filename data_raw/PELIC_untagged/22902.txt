I strongly agree with the authors' opinion. Children have a tendency to get lost their interest and curiosity and to get them easily. Even though I don't want to say that they are not mature there is no doubt that they are lack of ability for them to adapt to new circumstance compared to adults. It means that they are too sensitive to be affected by lots of unexpected situations. So I think that they are likely to get lost their curiosity and interest easily in the middle of process. As an example supported by the authors Teresa didn't accustomed to a new environment and an unexpected situation like a heavily evaluation pressure. In view of this fact I think that children are plausible to lost the sense of pleasure in their learning.
