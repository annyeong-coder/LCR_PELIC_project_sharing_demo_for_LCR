After visiting the Undergrad Grill restaurant I concluded that there are three different reasons failed this restaurant and make it unsatisfactory. First the mismanagement of the opening and renovations of the restaurant were in very short time. For this reasons the owner hired the first people he could find to do the renovation and painting. Also he ended up overpaying the workers to get the restaurant ready as soon as possible. In addition he didn't prepare enough money to do much advertising. Second every one knows the importance of serves in restaurant but it is not the case for this restaurant. Because it is not open enough time during the day children under age five are not allowed to get there. However the owner hired several student to do the cooking may should be asked for professional cook. Third the prices are expensive especially for the entrees. You could not find bare feet. Also you couldn't take out your food after you get done your food. After all this things from high prices and rules from the serves added to the restaurant problems and form the mismanagement. The owner should change its.
