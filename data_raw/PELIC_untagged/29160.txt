Essay outlines. Introduction Many people claim that children need strict disciple in order to be raised successfully. In addition those people assert that if we are not being strict with our children our society will have no sense of morals. However I think too much discipline has a devastating impact on children themselves as well as the society. Body paragraphs 1st paragraph The opposing point of view Children are not aware about their behavior's consequences. Their parents should have control on them. My point of view The most important thing is understanding the rules more. Not obeying mandatorily without even asking why 2nd paragraph The opposing point of view Many people say that we have been raised by old traditional methods which have very restricted discipline rules. As a result of that we became fully mature and successful My point of view If a certain discipline way was valid in the past that doesn't mean that it is legitimate now! 3Rd paragraph The opposing point of view With no imposing strict discipline our children will be drifted into depression and violence My point of view According to many research very restricted discipline triggers many psychological and physical problems that children will retain for entire their lives. Conclusion Discipline is not punishment! Self discipline is the best solution. We should explain how important our morals are instead of make our children obey the rules without thinking. They will violate the rules when they have a chance. Nowadays they have chances like never before! References 1 Child discipline. 2010 November 1 . In Wikipedia The Free Encyclopedia.
