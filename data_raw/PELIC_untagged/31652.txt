Using cell phone these days became inevitable in many places or we can say almost in every place. Although many people think that using cell phones in the classroom should be allowed I believe that it should be restricted. Opponents claim that cell phones are very important and many people relay on their cell phones to check important things during the day. For that students should be allowed to check their phones in classrooms. On the other hand I believe that students must concentrate in their classes and eliminate the use of their cell phones. They also need to be dependent on themselves in appointments and important things as if they don't have cell phones. Opponents also believe that using cell phones in class rooms can help students in searching for things related to class yet I believe that it is a way in distracting the attention of the student more than helping him. Students can compensate what they misunderstand after class or by asking the teacher in class. In sum using cell phones in classrooms are distracting more than useful. So students should not be allowed to use them in class.
