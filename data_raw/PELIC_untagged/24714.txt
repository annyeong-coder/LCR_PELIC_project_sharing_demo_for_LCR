I think sports stars earn the money they deserve. I'm not saying that their effort worth millions of dollars but they are actors of a circus that have huge audiences. Since sports stars are just a reflect of what societies want they must be paid for their shows. When a society turns superficial and fanatic people deserve to be robbed in the tickets office of stadiums and fields.
