In my opinion staying out of your apartment will help to overcome culture shock. First staying at home will create depressive time for a newcomer. Second there are different kinds of activities outside to be familiar with people of the new culture. Third it is rather possible to find a person from these people to be friend with in order to get more knowledge about the new culture. Then the newcomer can easily face with the culture to accustomed to.
