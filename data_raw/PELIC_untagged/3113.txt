RAV 2 Bedouins' life Bedouins have a difficult life because they live in the desert and they often travel but they have a good life because they are modest in their life and have special customs. There are many reasons for that. Firstly most people are hospitable and kind because they like to meet people. For example when anyone visits them they kill one lamb for him or her and make place ready for him or her and it is free. Secondly most they are honest and friendly so they often don't close their houses. In addition they help and visit each other for example if anyone needs money or any help they help him. Also they live with a big family so they love and help each other. Most they are married early for example women often get married at 16 years old and men often get married at 18 years old. They always wake up early at 5 30 a. M. And they go to bed early at 10 00 p. M. Finally I think they have a beautiful life because they enjoy their life but it is a complicated life.
