Topic Gender Discrimination in Taiwan Do Men Still Hold the Power Thesis statement Women should be highly respected in this society. There are three reasons to support my position women have merciful hearts women are good leaders and husbands and wives should have equal responsibilities and control over the household. 3 Brief arguments and 3 brief rebuttals 1. Some people think women should not be a boss or a president because they think the duty of a wife solely assisting the husband and educating the children. However I think women make excellent leaders because of their ability to empathize with their subordinates. 2. Living in Taiwan some women must yield obedience to her boyfriend husband or even male colleagues just because some men think they are superior. In fact I think everyone is equal and we receive the same education so women can express their thoughts and ideas as well as men. 3. Most men think that women should take care of children and do all family matters because they are the mother. In reality I think they should share responsibility for chores because both of them need to work.
