Going to Europe is my big dream since I was young. I read cartoons and books related with European culture especially related with the Renaissance. Also I have really enjoyed watching the movies whose subjects are European history. In fact many university students in Korea tend to travel to Europe before their graduation. However I couldn't get a chance to go there. I hoped that I go to Europe for my honeymoon since I went to graduate school but I couldn't either. Now I know I can go to Paris easily from Pittsburgh because Air France offers direct lines. I want to go to Paris Rome London and Napoli which have the great history and cultural heritage. If I go there I will visit the world famous museums and castles. I dream of having a coffee in a place like the one that Vincent Van Gogh painted in Cafe Terrace .
