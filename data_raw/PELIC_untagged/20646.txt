I had passed the level 4 of Japanese Language Proficiency Test by 2008. I had been working in a company when I tried to practise studying Japnese for the test. Although I wanted to pass the level 3 of JLPT I though that it is more important to study English than Japanese. I had planed to study English in America since I graduate from university so I applied for ELI Intensive Program around 5 months ago and then came to America to study English.
