My name is Student's First Name . I came to the States in the end of August. It took 24 hours because of the flight delay. Anyway I arrived safely. I have lived in homestay ever since I came to Pittsburgh. I have made many friends from other countries. But I've been suffering from homesick. So I have been keeping in touch with my family by E mail.
