Hi there Recently I have started to play the game of go which is famous in Japan Chinese Korea etc. I have been learning it since 2011. Among the many games played in the world it is said that go is the simplest yet most complex of all and that it can never be mastered within a lifetime. Actually when I was a high school student I met go for the first time. I have been doing it during the school life but I have stopped it because it was so profound and difficult. If you are interested in go please talk to me.
