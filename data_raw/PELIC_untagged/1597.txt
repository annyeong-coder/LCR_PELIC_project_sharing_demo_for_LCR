Style is different between countries and other. For example style in eating living working and decorate your home. Last week I looked at the Syrian and Lebanese room also we looked at the old American room. It was so different in every thing you can't find any similarity between them. But every room has shone their people style of living eating decorating and social life. In the Syrian and Lebanese room it shoes one of the oldest styles of decorating in the world. It was the living room I liked it because of the decoration it was colorful and the lights was amazing. It was enough for 10 people or more to sit in the room that's means the people who live in that time was social. The decoration was wonderful. It keeps you just looking in the wall and I think that means there were rich. It is also has some religious decoration that painted on the wall. The old American room was great and it shoes many things about old American history. It was a whole house. The colors are only brawn and white. They have the kitchen with the living and dining room in the same place. Also they have the bed room in the second floor with a secret door to hide if they Indians try to attack them. The secret door means that they live uncomfortable life because of the war with the Indian. Both of the rooms were great but I liked the Syrian room more than the old American room. I think because of the colors but that doesn't mean the old American room was not great. It was wonderful but I think if there was no war that time it could have been peter.
