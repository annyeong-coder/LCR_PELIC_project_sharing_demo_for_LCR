I think that ridding the world of nuclear weapons is important. Now some countries have developed nuclear weapons for a long time and they have threatened other countries. For example North Korea has powerful atomic bombs missiles and other nuclear weapons. This country always threaten South Korea and U. S. Sometimes they actually fire them or put them to the test. This action does not help to solve problems at all. This is not fair and very dangerous. To keep world's peace all countries over the world should not create them and keep the rule about nuclear weapon.
