I have been able to move from place to place. Before I didn't know my skill I suddenly found my skill. When I was coming U. S. I really wanted to see my parents. Suddenly I was standing downtown in Seoul. After I knew my skill every day I can move anywhere. Before I didn't know my skill I had come late to school but now I'm not late to school. Every weekend I go to Korea and I meet my friends.
