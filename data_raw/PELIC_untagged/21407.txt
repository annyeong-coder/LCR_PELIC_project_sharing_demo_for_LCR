Types of magazines Nowadays one of the most famous media is magazines. It is easy to get those from the shelf at bookstores bookstores' vender or automatic bookselling machines. People can gain a lot of information knowledge or entertainment from the magazines. In my opinion magazines can be categorized into three types information magazine knowledge magazine and entertainment magazine. Information magazine is the magazine giving general or specific stories that is interest. That is why I think this category is the biggest type. The example of this magazine is travel magazine readers' digest or news magazine etc. For example Time magazine cover with Obama picture in front. This magazine will tell you about who is Obama how he is important and his biography. Knowledge magazine is the magazine about academic or education such as The Economist Macworld or PCWorld. Most of these types require some basic knowledge unless you won't understand and get very boring about that. For example if you want to know how economy is and why it is to be you need to buy a magazine in this category such as business world. Entertainment magazine is the magazine telling about entertainment news sport or fashion etc. I mention sport into this kind because in my idea sport is one of the entertainments. Entertainment CYCLE SPORT or ELLE etc. Are the example of this category. For example OK! Weekly is one of the most famous entertainment magazine. Most issue will talk about super star gossip and hot issue in that week for instant Jen Vince get hot steamy in public! Or Gwen Gavin present baby Kingston . In conclusion there are other ways to divide types of magazines. However three categories above are useful for me to separate types of magazines. In addition the benefit from grouping or separate magazines like above is to use less time to find the magazine that we want easily.
