ANON_NAME_0 told me about the current issue in Saudi Arabia. He said nowadays food price are high. Many people cannot afford the expense of food. I asked him whether prices of all goods are going up. He responded that only food price is going up steeply. Others such as clothes and house price are even increasing but not a lot. Then I asked What causes the increase He stated that in his country most food was imported from other countries such as China and Europe and many good prices in the world had been increasing recently so food price in his country is influenced greatly by the fact. In addition I asked him what percent of food price had increased. He claimed that food price had increased around twenty percentage points and many people tried to contact with Saudi Arabia king. They hope he can help make the price lower.
