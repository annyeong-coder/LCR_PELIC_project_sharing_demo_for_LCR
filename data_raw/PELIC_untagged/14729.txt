My husband has been a great help tome since I started to study English in Pittsburgh. When I came here I couldn't speaking listening and writing in English very well. He encouraged me to study English again. He recommended me to go university of Pittsburgh ELI for intensive study. He lets me do my homework by myself. Also he makes me study English every day. However I make mistakes in speaking writing or grammar he helps me correct my mistakes. In addition he suggests that I need to talk with foreign friends such as American Japanese and Chinese friends. I always appreciate his giving me help.
