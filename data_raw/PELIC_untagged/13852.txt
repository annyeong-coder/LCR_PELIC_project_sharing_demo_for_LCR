These days the cooking has been considered as one of the most important aspects to choose your life partner. Most of the young people either men or women they are looking for this kind of persons who has cooking skills. For this reason I think it is very important for parent to pass their cooking skill to their children. Firstly it could be affect their children to demonstrate themselves as independent person. Secondly after long period of time those children will keep and pass their traditional food for other generation. Thus I think it is very important to keep our food custom and pass it to next generation by teach our children how to cook by themselves.
