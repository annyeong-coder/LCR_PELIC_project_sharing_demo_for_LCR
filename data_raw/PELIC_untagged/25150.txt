I Worked In BRH CQ When I got my bachelor's degree in Accounting. I went to look for work in my filed and found several posts very depending on the salary and rank according to existing ones. Then I found a job in BRH CQ. First of all I worked in function of the auditor was difficult start for me because I am not have any experience the work place. After that I worked hard and was my promotion to the post of auditor key. Then the problem is I did not have good English. It was a major problem in the face of any person employed by the company with investors from different nationalities. After seven months of work I decided to search for English language Institute for the development of my life up in the area of post. But I cannot find the appropriate Institute in my country. Next I decided to go to the USA to study at the Institute of language as well as get a master's degree and training to work in America. Finally now I am in America to studying English and study the master's in university. After that I well go back to my country and get a proper job.
