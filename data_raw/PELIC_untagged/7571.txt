Unfortunately teenagers in some countries have to work for some reasons while they continue their education. Especially before attending a university teenagers work instead of studying their lessons. I think they should prepare themselves by studying their lessons by playing games and by spending their leisure times with their friends for the future. Additionally teenagers who have to work tend to commit crimes and this situation also threaten safety. First of all teenagers should study their lessons while they are students instead of having jobs. For example in Africa people want their children to work because they need. Many students work under dangerous and difficult conditions. Whereas they should prepare and think about their lessons. On the other hand spending time with their friends and by playing games are very important to develop their individualities for students. Students forced to work don't improve their characters and mentality sufficiently. In order to qualify their mental and physical situations it must be offered them good opportunities and it should be prevented that they have to work. Finally people who have to work while they are students tend to commit an offense such as theft drug related crimes and murdering. This situation threatens the safety everywhere. In order to eliminate this risk absolutely these people should be educated carefully while they are students. In conclusion teenagers who have to work while they are still students
