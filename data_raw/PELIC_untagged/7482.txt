In Korea we had a wedding boom last year because people having family events had great fortune in 2006 which had two spring starting days which are recycled around every 200 year. Therefore every church and wedding hall was reserved and many friends of mine had wedding ceremonies. When Chihoon and I were looking for our wedding place and a suitable date only two choices remained in my church. However because we had to go to the U. S just one choice was possible. Unfortunately that date was supposed to be my best friend's wedding in her church. I hoped to have my wedding ceremony in my church but my friend would have been disappointed not to be able to participate in and see each other's wedding ceremony. Moreover our other friends would have been divided to participate in each ceremony. Finally I decided to choose that date because my friend and I saw the positive side of this situation. My friend and I would have the same anniversary and we could meet together on the wedding day to go on our honeymoon at the Hayatt hotel near the airport. I'm happy to remember her wedding date and I shouldn't have worried.
