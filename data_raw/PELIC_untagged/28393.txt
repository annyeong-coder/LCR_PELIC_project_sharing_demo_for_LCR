When I was a child I had a bedroom which had lots of stuff. There was a bed in the corner which was always neat and tidy. That was the bed on which I slept. I had a desk beside my bed on which I did my homework. There was a persian rug on the floor that my grandfather whose daughter is my mom gave me. My bedroom had two windows through which fresh air could get inside. I shared this room with my cousin from whom I received a letter last week and I enjoyed the times when he was over at our house. I loved my room where I spent most of my time in.
