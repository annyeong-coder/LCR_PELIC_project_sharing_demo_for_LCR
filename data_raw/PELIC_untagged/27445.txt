Children stand and they look at the shinny sun for their first time in theirlives. They don't beleive what they are seeing the incredible uncloudy weather. Moreover it is their first time that they feel the heat of the sun. I can't beleive how warm the weather is because the sun do you think it is too hot there in the sun a child says that for his peers. Margrot is still stuck in the closet and she tries very hard to knock and scream but everybody is outside looking at the sun! A man passes through the iwhle suddenly she hears the sound of shoes on the ground from a 100 feet distance. There is a stunned silence that you can hear insects fly. When the man acrosses near to the closet she cries. Unfortunatley the man is deaf and he cann't hear at all. What a bad situation. Outside the teacher noticed that Margrot is not with children. Where is Margrot he asks. All children look at each other and remember that they lock the closet and Margrot inside it. He realizes that they did somthing wrong for her and he asks Peter who is the student always discloses secrets. She is at the clost! Peter says. The teacher runs to the closet and opens it for her. She was tiried crying all the 3 last hours. He helped her is the sun disappeared Margrot asks tem mintues left teacher answers. She runs to a window and looks at weather. She starts crying and laughing in the same time and she walks to outside and stand for 10 minutes in silence and happiness that never happened for her.
