I like categorization of people's personality. After applying these categorizations which is written in the textbook to me and my husband I found interesting differences of personalities between us. I am a feeler but my husband is a thinker. For example we are supposed to have a dog. I am a person who wants to have a dog because I feel a dog is pretty and comforting for our life. However my husband who is a scientist tends to be rational and thinks more realistic things which are related with taking care of the dog and cost of keeping it. In addition he thinks a dog as a guard of our house. Also he usually tries to coordinate our activities so that we can eliminate the waste of time. However my mood is more important to do something in daily life in my philosophy. Next I am a perceiver and my husband is a judger. For example my husband needs to decide what we buy and the place where we go shopping exactly before we leave home. When we go out to have dinner he wants to decide a certain restaurant. On the other hand I am a person whose plans are always ambiguous and flexible. My mind may change at that time when we arrive at the place so my husband is reluctant to go shopping with me who easily change the plans. Such differences of personalities between us are the underlying reason for which I and my husband sometimes make a little conflict in our life. Positively saying we are making up something we don't have each other.
