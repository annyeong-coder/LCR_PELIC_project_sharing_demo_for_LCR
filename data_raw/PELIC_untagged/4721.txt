I met Ramazan who is the best friend in my life while I was waiting in the university resgistration line. While we were waiting the line Ramazan asked me some questions about the registration form. That was the first experience for us. After we finished the registration we ate lunch together in the restaurat. I enjoyed Ramazan and we decided to get a new apartment. We were living in a small apartment until we graduated from university. We went to a lot of good places together while we were attending university. While we were travelling in Italy he broke his leg and he stayed in hospital 2 weeks. When he stayed hospital I accompanied him. He is really unlucy person. When I went home he got a big operation. While we were living together he cooked a lot of delicious food. I can't forget his macaroni. After he finished university he started job hunting and he found a good job. He is a customs inspector. As long as live I won't forget him.
