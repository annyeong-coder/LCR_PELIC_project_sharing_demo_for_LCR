2 When surnames began appearing in Europe 800 years ago a person's identity and occupation were often intertwined. Surname was a direct link between who a person was and what the person did. For instance Taylor is the old English spelling of tailor and Clark is derived from clerk an occupation of considerable status during the Middle Ages because it required literacy. Moreover the names walker Wright Carter Stewart and turner indicate occupations. Take for example a walker was someone who cleaned cloth a wright was a person in charge of a farm or estate and a turner worked a lathe. In addition one of the few occupational surnames reflecting the work of women is Webster which refers to a female weaver.
