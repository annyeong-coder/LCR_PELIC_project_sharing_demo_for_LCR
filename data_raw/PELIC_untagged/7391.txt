My room in my country is a place where I spent most of my casual time. It's a small room on the third floor with a set of desk and chair by which there is a window. The window through which I can see outside when I am tired is bright and clear. Usually I can see a car whose owner is my father. On the other side the place I sleep around which I am sure that there are some trash. Thus my mother always asks me clean my room by myself. My mother is a person whom is very neat but she unfortunately has a messy son.
