What have you achieved this term My idea just generated to come to America to enhance my English ability. Before coming to America I anticipated to speak English as an native speaker. Now I am still pursuing this goal I have been here for almost one year. My good English attributes to practice and correct myself everytime. However my philosophy is exhibiting myself in English surrounding and clarify the abstract vobcabulary or sentences everyday. Unfortunately I am getting adapt to the full of English environment my English is improving stably and my English sounds better than before. And it's the time to get a job and get back to the environment which is no English around me anymore. It is crucial to get into the language which you are trying to learn every single day but this kind of opportunity is getting less when I got back to Taiwan. Hope I can get a job which is in foreign company and I have more chances to achieve my goal. I won't let myslef to waste this year's work English is my love and my second language.
