Hello! I'm thinking what is the best way to begin this profile but I'm afraid I'm not inspired. So I'll use the traditional way My name is ANON_NAME_0 and I come from Spain. I like to know the origin of the words my family says that I'm always searching everything in my dictionaries and that is the reason why I know the original meaning of my name. ANON_NAME_0 comes from Hebrew Mikael and means 'the one who is like God'. Now I'm living in Pittsburgh because I want to improve my English and know new friend. In fact if I must choose one aspect that could define me it would be that I love this kind of experiences meeting people from other countries. And of course I'm learning a lot of English too. So this is the perfect experience. . . One moment. . . Am I dreaming Present simple I come My family says I know ANON_NAME_0 means I love Present progressive I'm thinking I'm always searching I'm living I'm learning Am I dreaming Vocabulary word aspect
