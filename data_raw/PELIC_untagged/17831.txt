I met ANON_NAME_0 while we were registrating for ELI program He was speaking Arabic that how I knew he is from KSA. I walked to him and introduced my self to him he was very nice with me. Now ANON_NAME_0 and I are classmates he has a nice character. Our classmates picked out a nick name for him DOUBLE CHECK it is not bad he always want to ensure that every thing is OK with him. That is a good thing because he asks a good question in the classes. Last week he asked Carol a question while she was answering an other student's question that was funny he can't wait to ask his question.
