Having jobs while people are still studying a good idea or not Nowadays in some countries teenagers have jobs while they are still students. There are different opinions about this tendency some people think that is a good choice while others say that probably this is a way to loose time in our studies. In my opinion and for that it has been my experience I think that is a good idea. It's obvious that there are many disadvantages in this kind of choice but probably the advantages are much more. First of all it's very important for young people especially when they are students at the university to practice different experiences. This means that sometimes studying on books is not enough in people's cultural formation get a job could be a way to appreciate more the study but also to test us in a different activity. Doing this we could be more prepared in future especially in facing life's difficulties when it will be necessary. In addition having the possibility to earn money by their own capacities is really a good thing. This means that students have a big sense of responsibility they don't want to be supported only by their parents but trying to be more indipendent. In this way they have the possibility to acquire new and important tasks to learn what does it mean being totally indipendent from their family but also to be prepared when they won't have the support of their parents anymore. In conclusion I'm in favor of this kind of choices. Young generations and students are the future of our society and countries so they have to demonstrate more than others to be mature people. Having jobs while they are still studying take care of themselves and being indipendent from their families is an important step to increase their skills and to practice these skills in future.
