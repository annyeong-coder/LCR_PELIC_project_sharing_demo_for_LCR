Every student would ask who will be her his teacher while he she move to a new term. We have experienced many different teaching styles. Teacher is crucial for students' studying. I will draw a parallel between the new teacher who just gets a teaching job and a old teacher who has had many years teaching experience in personal model. The new teacher has less experience to run teacher centred classes. In her his class students are easy to feel bored and cannot concentrate the class. Because the new teacher don't know how to make interesting lecture and attract the students. The new teachers also don't know to instruct students in encouraging student's participation and adapting their presentation. Comparing the new teacher the old teacher has great experience to run teacher centred classes with an emphasis on demonstration. They know how to properly do a task or work through a problem. They make students learn efficiently in the classes. After comparing we know why the old teachers are welcome by students a lot. Because they exhibit their good personal model.
