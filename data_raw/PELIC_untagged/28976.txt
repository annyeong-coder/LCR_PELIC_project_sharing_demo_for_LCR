I m alone in desert island . I didn't recognize that I should have prepared myself for they dangerous adventures . I should have toke a matches to start a fire . Also I should have brought a knife to product myself from wild animals. Today I received a call from my girlfriend . I asked her many things that will bring with . I got many advise from her . She told me you should not go alone in the night you had better not sleep under tree and you ought to not use your cell phone . I believe once I receive the supporting stuff from my girlfriend I could start to use water economically . I might not use a flashlight all the night . However this is a big lesson that impact my life .
