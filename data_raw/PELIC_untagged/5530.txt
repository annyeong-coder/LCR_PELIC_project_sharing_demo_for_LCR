When I was on vacation in Miami in this May I took on a taxi at the airport. I felt like the taxi driver didn't seem to be good but I took it anyway. While he was driving he asked several questions to me. I don't like to talk to strangers and I didn't especially want to talk to him but I did as ignorance seems to be rude. I just hoped that I could get to my hostel as soon as possible. Actually his service was not that good because he drave so fast and it made me feel uncomfortable. When I arrived at my hostel I paid money as a fare and I expected him to give me a change and then I could pay him a tip. It was pretty much to get the tip if he didn't give me the change. Unfortunetely he didn't do what I wanted him to do and it was a bit ackward situation to tell him that you should give me the change. So I just let him take all money even though I didn't really intend it. I thought that I should have prepared some changes when I paid the fare to the taxi driver. I stil feel bad that I tipped him much than I wanted.
