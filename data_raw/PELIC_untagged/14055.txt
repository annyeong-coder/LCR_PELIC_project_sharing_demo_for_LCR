The real name on the Internet Nowadays Korean governments try to make new policy about Internet. I am going to write why they want to make new policy and then I will show views of each side that is agreement and disagreement. I am against that new policy that is why I am going to write 1 paragraph about aspect of agreement side and then 2 paragraphs about aspect of disagreement side. Each paragraph has an example that is at least one example. Of course there is a lot of problems on the internet because of non real name but I will focus on disagreement side because I think new policy is to violate human rights.
