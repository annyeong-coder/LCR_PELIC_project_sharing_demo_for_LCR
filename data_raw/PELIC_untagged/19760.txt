Last weekend I have read The Bridges of Madison County . It is a novel by ANON_NAME_0 Waller. It narrates a story of an Italian woman who got married to American and moved with him to a small town in the U. S. After they got married they had a boy and a girl. The woman who called Francesca was living a boring life. She was a teacher but she had left the job to raise her kids. After that she became only a farmer's wife. One day her family traveled for one week and they left her home alone. During that a photographer came to the town to shoot the bridges over there. He came across Francesca house while she was sitting in the porch. And he asked her about the direction of one of the bridges. This small coincidence triggered a passionate love story between them. They spent warm romance time while her family was away. Francesca felt herself thriving when she was with him. He was a gentle man. She found everything she was missing in him. At the end of the week he asked her to escape with him which left her in a serious dilemma. She couldn't threaten her family stability and leaving them for the town's people gossip. On the other hand she was a fragile in front of the photographer's love. At the end she made her decision to stay with her family and sacrifice her love. She lived the rest of her life consoling herself with only thing that had left for her from her lost love their memories together.
