Like 1. What I like about the U. S. Is when I buy clothes I can purchase cheaper clothes than my country. 2. One thing that I like about the U. S. Is the weather which is not so humidity. 3. What I like about the U. S. Is that I can learn a lot more things about other cultures as an international student. Dislike 1. What I don't like about the U. S. Is that the living circumstances are a bit unconvenient for example every store is closed too early. 2. One thing that I don't like about the U. S. Is how unconvenient the transportation system is. 3. What I don't like about the U. S. Is when I eat food the food is so fatty and greasy.
