I think you should keep in touch with him. One time a week is not enough. When you call him more than once a week he might tell you if he in love with you or you should say to him you are in love with him. Although you should have told him befor he left. Anyway I should not have said that because he has already left. If you dont like this idea you have another selotion which is you have to visit him and tell him what you feel. But you should not quit your job before make sure he loves you. Abslotely if he loves you he will ask you to move there.
