I agree that online shopping is bad for the environment because it caused air pollution. There were a lot of companies delivered items urgently for next day delivery. Using airplanes to deliver these items consumed more fuel and produce more carbon dioxide. Moreover day by day the customers increased and also online shopping be more popular than before. This will affect more in the environment if there is no plan to reduce the amount of travel by airplanes daily. When the online customers increased the air pollution also will increase. Sometimes one online customer will buy one item today and then tomorrow he will buy another item which will cause more travel to deliver these items. Finally reading change my opinion about online shopping than before because now I know the bad effect of online shopping such as air pollution and using more paper for packing to the environment and try to shop online more carefully .
