Nanjing where I grew up is a big city in the middle east of China. It's the city where the Yangtze River run through. Nanjing is the place where is a rich history of culture. This city was the capital for about 400 years in ancient times. Nanjing is particularly important of recent history when it was chosen as capital of the republic of China. In 1949 the Communist Party defeaded Kuomintang and a lot of people fled from Nanjing to a small island where they still live to this day. The hause where my parents still live is on a main street near the center of the city. It's a very bussy street where is always a lot of traffic. It's expecially bussy in the morning or late afternoon when people are going to work or coming back home. However my house is located in a beautiful area where are the Zijing mountain and the ancient citywall near by.
