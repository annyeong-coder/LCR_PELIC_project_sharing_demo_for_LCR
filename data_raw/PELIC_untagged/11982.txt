Over the next 10 years do you think the use of major languages other than English will increase or decrease on the World Wide Web Support your position orally or in writing by presenting reasons and examples. As the clock is still ticking there has been new websites created every minute. Most people prefer to publish their websites in their own languages. However if they want their websites to be internationally known the websites will be published in English language. In this essay I will mention two major factors that contribute to the increase of English on the World Wide Web in the next ten years. The first factor is a rise in number of online shopping websites. Most people would like to own their shopping stores but they prefer not to pay for the rental fee. As a consequence they create their online shopping websites. The owners want to increase the total sales by increasing the number of customers. One of the best alternatives to achieve this goal is to publish their websites in English language. As a result the use of English in the websites has been increasing. Like the owner of online shopping websites the owner of personal websites also wants their content internationally. The personal website is a website created by individual for the purpose of writing their daily lives publishing their photos and videos and making new friends. As owners of a personal website want to have more readers they normally publish their writing in English. Nowadays there are personal websites for free for example Hi5 Window Live Space Face book and Multiply. Consequently the personal websites in English have been rising. In summary for these two principal factors mentioned above there has been an increasing number of websites of which their content is in English. I believe that this trend will continue for more than ten years.
