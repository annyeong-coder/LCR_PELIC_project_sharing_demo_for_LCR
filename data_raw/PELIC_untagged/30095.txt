I remember the first time I came to Pittsburgh. I needed to know where the Cathedral of learning is and how its building looks like. Also I wondered who will be my advisor and how many classes I should take. In the first day no one of my friends seems to know when our advisor will come to G 17. After a while she came and she introduced herself. That she was cooperative person was obvious from the first time. She asked students who did not find accommodations to help them. I saw many students in class and I did not have a clue where they are from. At 9. 00 A. M we took a placement test which was difficult. After the test I had no idea whether I'll pass the test and if I pass the test which level I'll start my studying at ELI. Then I got the result that surprised me because it told me that I'll start in level 4. Now I believe that the ELI is best place if you want to learn English.
