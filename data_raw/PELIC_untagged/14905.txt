I have lots of stuff need to do this weekend. First I have to do laundry because I have not washing my clothes for three weeks. Next I will bring my friends to my house for dinner what is cooked by my roommate another Chinese man. Then I will finish my homework soon. Mostly I will finish my homework by the day that teacher gives us homework. What's more There is an ice skating activity on Saturday I like ice skating. I think I will go to ice skating if the weather is not too bad. These are present few things which are on my arrangement I believe there should have some sudden things that out of my plan.
