Dear Confused I read your letter and I am sorry for your difficult situation. First of all you should rethink the international marriage even if your fiance and his parents are wonderful persons. You have been in the US only for nine months and you cannot know the real aspects of living in the US in such short time. You may find many differences of customs and ways of thinking between you and your fiance in the future. I think you need more time before you decide the international marriage. If you have chance you had better ask the stories of people who really experienced international marriage. Next I recommend you to spend the summer in Japan as your parents said. Your parents didn't agree with the marriage because they are really worrying about you. I think they also really miss you. You should meet with them and relieve them from worrying. If you meet them and talk directly and sincerely the situation may change in a good way. Finally please don't forget you have been in the US to study not to find your partner. Besides I guess your parents help you financially. If so you have to concentrate your study more and you have to achieve your goal acquiring your master's degree before you worry about your relationship. After you finish studies get a job and you become an independent woman you can ask your parents to accept your marriage with Jim again. If the bond between you and Jim is real you can get over many difficulties even if it takes a long time. Anyway your life is only one time and you cannot go back the past. Please don't hurry up!
