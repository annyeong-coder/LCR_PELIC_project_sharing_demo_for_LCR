First if Caral is the oldest city in the Americas that means this city was the first major trade center for the region. Probably in this region started business they trade food fish nets etc to the other region first to survive because I think the life in the desert was no easy and second to know about different cultures and food in the same region. Second the farmers at Caral found the way to redirect rivers into trenches and canals which still crisscross the Super Valley today to bring water to their fields that show us they was very intelligent people beccause change the course of the rivers is not easely and this the way thah they could have water and food. Now we can understand how the Caral's people can survive in the desert. Third this part involve the last two parts because Shady found cottonseeds fibers and textiles. They knew how can produce this thinks probably with the water of the rivers they can started to sow the cotton and found the way to use this cotton on clothes and nets then they trade this thinks for food that they didn't have and I think because they was at the center of the region between mountains and coast every people who needs to travel they need it to stopped at Caral.
