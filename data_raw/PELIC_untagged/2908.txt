The first connection is the political power and the individual freedom. In this case if some government required taking another or other languages it will eliminate the meaning of individual freedom maybe because the person do not want to study other languages than just his her native one. The second connection is the language and the economic. For example if a person wants to open a business and it require English and he don't know the language such as for the papers or communication with other countries in this case he can't open the business. The third relationship is between people and groups with language. If one group use the world language and this group is important but maybe some people who interested in that group don't use their language so there will be no communication. Another thing is the culture and the communities. If a person want to share his her culture to other countries but s he don't use their language it will be difficult to deliver that. Finally the countries that use the world language more than their language will increase the opportunity to eliminate their native language.
