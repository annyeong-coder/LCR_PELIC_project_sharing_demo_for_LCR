Many people think that the capital punishment should be abolished because they believe it is a harsh penalty however the capital punishment has positive effects on the society. The first positive outcome of enforcing the capital punishment especially on homicide cases that it will scare people from doing it because they know the consequences of killing someone. Moreover keeping a criminal in jail for the rest of his life is inhuman and unproductive because there is no positive outcome that is expected of the criminal life except for suffering in jail. Finally keeping criminals in jail for a long time is convenient neither to the deceased family nor to the taxpayers.
