I think I have to bring matches. I can use them to light a fire. It might be very cold in a desert island so I need a fire. In addition if there is a fire I will be able to cook. Also I think I should bring a solar powered computer. Before I leave I can download many movies and TV shows and music. It has got to very useful to the boring life in the isolated desert island. Finally I ought to choose a toothbrush for my healthy teeth. I must brush my teeth after every meal which could prevent from cavities and bad breath.
