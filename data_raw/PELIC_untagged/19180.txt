My best friend is ANON_NAME_0. I met him in the ELS when I was studying English there. I started talking to him when one classmate introduced him to me. After that he became my best friend and he showed me the same feeling. Now he left to Saudi Arabia for vacation and I really missed him. We were always enjoying our time. We were meeting in a coffee shop. Sometimes I was paying the bill for the coffee and he was charging if I payed the bill.
