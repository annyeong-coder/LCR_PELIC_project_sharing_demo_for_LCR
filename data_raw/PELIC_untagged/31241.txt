My dream destination is the city of Almadenah. It is located in the western region of Saudi Arabia. It has the prophet mosque which has been rebuilt in a charming modern way. The people of this city are friendly and nice. There are a lot of ancient buildings in it. At night the city looks beautiful and decorated with lights. In this city lived prophet ANON_NAME_0 peace be upon him. It has a great history in Saudi Arabia. It is also considered as the second best city to visit after Mecca for all Muslims. I hope that I can visit this city soon.
