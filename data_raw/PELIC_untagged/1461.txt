Tow years ago I met my friend Heshim. I met him just when he came to Riyadh which was studying there. We were meeting in computer's department. He likes computer so much I hadn't seen like him in the department. He was studying very well. He did a lot of homework in that department. Also he was studying hard. So I was interesting with him in that school. Finally we are good friends now and we always play together.
