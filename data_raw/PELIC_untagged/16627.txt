I'm trying to descibe a little about myself. First of all I think I'm a person easygoing. For example help some friends be calm and relax with them. I addition I'm studying English here at English Language Institute becuase I want to prepare my master in Finacial Accounting. Also I try to learn English a lot. I always try to improve my speaking because I have to get something by myself and do my homework everyday. In my free time I like to play soccer and chat in the internet. Because of easygoig improve my speaking and do something in my free time I think I have a life very leasy .
