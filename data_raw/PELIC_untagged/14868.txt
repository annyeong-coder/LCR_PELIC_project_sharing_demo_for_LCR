Hi guys. My name is ANON_NAME_0 but you can call me Christina which is my Christian name because it is difficult for some people to pronunciation. Although winter is cold I like winter because I can enjoy ice skating and skiing. I am expecting to go to do skating on Wednesday in ELI. Moreover I enjoy watching animations. 'The Simpsons' is the one of my favorite animations. I came here about a month ago and I am studying English in the ELI. Because I know that I learn many things out of class as well as in the class I am always trying to participate in many programs. When I am further adapted for living in Pittsburgh I will join other programs such as club activity or free programs in Carnegie Library. I am looking forward to growing my English ability.
