In 1998 a friend invited me to his birthday party. He also invited his classmates and one of them brought his sister Laura to the party. During the party while I was speaking with the birthday man he introduced me to all his classmates and at that point I saw Laura. My first impression about her was positive. She immediately seemed to me very nice with her long red hair her blue eyes and most of all freckles an uncommon beauty. I was very shy in front of her so I thought over how to approach her more than one time. At the end I decided that the right moment had come. When there was a pleasant backgroung music I went to her and we started to chew the fat she was living in Rome while I was living in Terni she was studying at La Sapienza university while I was studying at the University of Perugia she was playing tennis when I was a soccer referee and won two tournaments in 1996 and in 1997. At the end of the party we shared our cell phone numbers and since that day we started to date.
