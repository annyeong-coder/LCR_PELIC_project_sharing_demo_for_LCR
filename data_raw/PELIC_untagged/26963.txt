Kuwait National Day Kuwait Liberation Day is the day that is full of peace. This day is celebrated by Kuwaitis every year to remember the exciting moment of peace after the invasion Iraq to Kuwait. On this special day Kuwait begins the preparation for the celebration before a couple of weeks. To get ready for this celebration many Kuwaitis buy many things and get prepared. To get ready many Kuwaitis go to the tailor with a special design of dress that has a symbol of Kuwait. Men wear a white dress called Dishdasha and the children wear clothes that have a symbol of Kuwait. And they buy soap foam to celebrate with it. Something that's special on this day is the booth which is a small store that sells everything related to Kuwait scattered on the streets. In the 25th of Feb of every year you will notice many booths that sell flags of Kuwait. There are 3 exciting kinds of flags and scarves. The first one is of course the flag of Kuwait the second flag is white which represents peace and finally the yellow flag which represents the Shuhada'a which is the people that were killed during the invasion. And on this day you will notice many people wearing Kuwait's dress. Many cars colored with a color that is relevant to the flag of Kuwait. Many houses have a large flag of Kuwait decorating the house from outside. At night after the celebrations the families go to their relatives and congratulate each other they might say some stories that happened during that hard period of the invasion of Iraq on Kuwait which is approximately 6 months or more from the 2nd of Aug 1990 until the 25th of Feb 1991. When the celebration ends families go back home and their faces are full of joy. I recommend anyone that didn't see this day in Kuwait to come and see it because it is a very exciting day even though it requires a lot of preparation.
