Indent Women should keep on working after they marry. Although many people think that women should quit their job after they get married because they need to spend a lot of time to take care of the family. However I think this is the wrong concept right now. First of all if the reason why women need to quit their job just because they need to take care of the family I suggest women can get a part time job instead of the full time job. In a research it indicates that the women in developed countries still maintain high percentage of working after they get married. But many of them choose the part time job instead of the full time job in order to have more flexible time to take care of their family. This is a wise solution to solve the problem which career women have too less time to arrange their family. Second the cost of living is higher than before thus every family needs more than one income to maintain the living standard. In order to have and support the better living standard double incomes are necessitated. Besides this some women's working ability maybe better than some men's. Therefore it's a pity if those excellent women just stay at home and do housework. Third it's easy and convenient for women to gain the latest information while they are working. If they stay at home it might be hard for them to catch the trend thus could cause a gap between her and her family. There are many advantages if women keep on working after they marry thus I support women shouldn't quit their jobs although they get married.
