I have an interesting experience even it has happened for six months I still can't forget that day. Six months ago I decided to come here to learn English for one year but I had never left Taiwan for so long before I came here. My parents worried me very much. Until the day I prepared to go to airport my flight departed Taiwan at 12 00p. M so it was too late for them. I told my parents don't take me to airport and they said OK . When I arrived airport my mom called me she told me something to care. At the same time I saw my dad was standing in front of the check in desk and my mom was talking to my brother. As soon as I saw the sight I burst into tears I was really surprised!! I didn't know their plan at all. They told me although it was 12 00 they wanted to see me in airport. I had always felt I have been 25 years old already but in my parents' eyes I still a child. They really love me and I also really love them and miss them.
