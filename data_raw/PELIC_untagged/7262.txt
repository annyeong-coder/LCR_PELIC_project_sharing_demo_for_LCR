Seoul where I lived is so familiar to me. I remember the days when I was there. Town where I lived is not big. There is a park where I used to play baseball with my friends. Church where I have attended before I came here was placed in that town. Every sunday when I went to church was very busy. I knew many neighborhoods whom I played a lot with. I miss that town where I spent my childhood.
