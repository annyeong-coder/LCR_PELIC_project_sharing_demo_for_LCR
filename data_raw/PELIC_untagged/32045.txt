If I were able to travel to any country I would go to Japan. Because I obsess about it I always dream about it. I have lots friends in my Facebook and they told me about Japan and the civilization there. They told me about the capital city Tokyo and how it's very beautiful. Moreover they told me about the building and how it's very crowded. Also they told me about the behavior and habits. I really want to visit Japan and recognize their culture.
