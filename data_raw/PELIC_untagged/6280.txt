Any one has favorite musician even in his country or in other country. My favorite musician is ANON_NAME_0 Abdo. He is worldwide I mean he is very famous in Middle East. He is native Saudi and he is solo musician. I think he is dedicated to his songs. In addition he is lively in arabian people. He is calming man when he want to sing. When you want to talk about the music in Middle east ANON_NAME_0 Abdo is memorable.
