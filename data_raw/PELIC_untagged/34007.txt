Dear Xavi I am very delighted to hear from you. If you are planning to study in the US I recommend that you consider Pittsburgh as an alternative to San Francisco. First it is crucial to have a look on the university rankings and obviously you will find out that Pittsburgh universities are highly ranked and favorable in terms of its educational system. Second in Pittsburgh you could find so many English language institutes which are highly recommended to improve your language. Pittsburgh is known for its severely cold winters and stifling hot summers However San Francisco also have a compatible weather as well it is cold even during the summer. There are also many factors that you could consider coming to Pittsburgh because they have professional teams such as Steelers and penguin pirates and panthers. In addition you can find variety of cuisine from different parts of the world. I was astonished to find that they even serve dishes from my country. In terms of people they are very friendly and very helpful that I even do not feel that I am outside my country. In contrast to the cost of living in San Francisco there is a huge difference in prices and it always depends on the area that you are going to live in. I hope that this answers all your questions and help you make up your mind despite the state of hesitation that you have. If you are planning on coming to Pittsburgh I could show you around places that might interest you with no restrictions. You could just say where you want to go and I will take you there. Take care and keep in touch. Thank you Fadel
