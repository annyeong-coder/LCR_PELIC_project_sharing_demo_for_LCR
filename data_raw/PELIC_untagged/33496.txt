When I was a chihld I used to go out with my father. One day while we were being on the road we saw an accident ahead. There was two cars which had hit each other. At that time my father called 911 to help. Aftar that my father asked people to help people whe were laying on the ground. I had never seen like this accident. Wilhe we were waiting an ampulance came. When the police came he asked my father about the accident. My father toled him that this accident had happened before we came. By the time it ended we listened someone screming around when we looked around we saw another car which had gone away after accident.
