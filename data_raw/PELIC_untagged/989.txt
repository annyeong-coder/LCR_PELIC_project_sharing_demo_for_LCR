My brother's friend is a successful person. I like the way that he treats me and treats all the people. He is a manger of a group that travels everywhere. If they want to travel they travel as a group. When I want to travel I always travel with him because I always have fun when I go with him. It is a good way to go to some places with a group or some friends you know. We traveled to Al Medina last year. We did a lot of activates. When we wanted to do something we did it as a group even if it is a little thing. If the group had not done every thing as groups we would not have had a lot of fun in Al Medina. The more we worked with each other the more we were successful. We had many competitions when we where there. We gave people gifts when they did not win! We were trying to have the happiness in every thing we did. I always say when I don't travel once a year at least I'll get board
