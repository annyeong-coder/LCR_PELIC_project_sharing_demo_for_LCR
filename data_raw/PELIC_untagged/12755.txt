In some countries teenagers have jobs while they are still students. I think this is a good idea because they can learn the independence from their parents have good economic minds and habits lastly do various experiences through their jobs. The first advantage to have jobs when they are still student is they can learn and build independent attitudes to their own life. If teenagers have any opportunity to do something as a job they intend to be less dependent on their parents and they can feel confidence that they can do whatever for themselves. For instance my father earned money living alone since he was young and now he is very strong attitude about life. On the other hands I had never earned money while I was a student so I relatively depend on my parents. Therefore having jobs for teenagers is a good chance and also a way to build their independent attitudes and confidence. The second advantage is that they can have good economic minds and habits and also control their money effectively. Through such an experience they can realize how to spend and save money at the early time. If teenagers make money from their jobs they would consider the money they earn very precious and don't spend it easily. The last advantage is that they can do varying experiences and can meet diverse people. Although teenagers' jobs are part time jobs or very small things they can experience social official life in advance and also meet a variety of people by having jobs. It would help them to select their jobs in the future. Therefore it is a good idea for teenagers to have jobs while they are still students because they can learn the independence good economic minds and habits at an early age and do various experiences through their jobs.
