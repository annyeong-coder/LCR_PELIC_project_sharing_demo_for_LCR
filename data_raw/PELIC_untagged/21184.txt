I had been preparing the Pennsylvania Driver License exam throughout the last october. I had searched all rules from PennDot Driver User Manual Guide book before taking the exam. At the exam day I had passed it without no mistakes but I can not say anything about driving test because I couldn't. Due to a confusion of green yellow light. I had been driving to a intersection slowly. The traffic light was green and at that time the light was turned abruptly to yellow. I had been little confused between stopping or keep going. I decided to stop but I didn't take the correct position. Consequently I didn't pass the driving exam at my first chance.
