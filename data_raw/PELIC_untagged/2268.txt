I met my friend A young at my university. At that time it was my first time to go to the university. I was freshman so I didn't know anything about the school information such as location of my major. Before I met her I was just wandering the school. I had to find my building but I couldn't. I asked a girl who was next to me about direction and she said that she was also looking for that building. While we were walking to our building we were talking about many things. I could know her major is same as mine. Since then we spent a lot of time together at school. She is still my best friend.
