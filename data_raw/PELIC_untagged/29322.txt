If I had been born and raised in the US I must have been overweight because there are plenty of fast food chins. If I had studied in the American high school I would not have taken lessons after school and could have had more time to play volleyball with my friends. The most important thing is I would have spoken English very well if I had been raised in the US. Although I spend much time to learn English now I still wish I were not born in the US because there are no night markets. In addition I like to travel Japan and eat the sashimi there consequently it might have cost me more money to buy an air ticket if I had lived in the US not Taiwan.
