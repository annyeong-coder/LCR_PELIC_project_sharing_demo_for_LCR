It is very difficult for anyone to have more than one role in life. The woman is a great human. She is able to play different roles that change depending on her environment at home or outside of the home. First of all a woman has a great role at home. She could be a wife so she has to focus on her husband's needs. Every woman works hard to make happy life for her husband she keeps on cleaning his cloths preparing his favorite meals. Also She encourage him to do great things in his life by sending him to his work with saying beast wishing every morning then receiving him by a big smile at him. Naturally she will play a second role for her when she has kids that role is a mother role. At this point she has two roles so she tries to play these roles perfectly however that is a challenge. At the same time she has to take care of her husband and her kids equally. In fact making a strong family isn't an easy thing she has to concentrate on the education of her kids and more importantly on their health. In addition her kids will take good basics behavior from her so she has to behave politely to influence them. More over the woman could be a worker woman so she will play another role besides wife and mother different kinds of roles outside of the home that the woman can play are a teacher doctor or student all of them need hard work from her. The woman who has this role must be a patient woman because working outside of the home isn't easy for a woman who has kids. Even when her husband cooperates with her still there is a stress on her mind. In conclusion wife mother teacher or doctor all of these roles that are the woman transfers between them affect in life of everyone. In my opinion the person who is able to play many roles at home and outside of the home should be respected by all people.
