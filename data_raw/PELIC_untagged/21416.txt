I have been in Pittsburgh for 3 months and have made some friends in the ELI. One of my friends is Peggy whose personality is optimistic and earnest. She has many advantages that I appreciate. For example Peggy is an outgoing girl who can easily make friends in a strange environment. And she is willing to share everything which is funny delightful or moved. Besides Peggy studies hard because she is eager to improve her English. I am glad to have a lovely friend and I will keep in touch with her when I go back to Taiwan.
