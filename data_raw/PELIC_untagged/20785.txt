One day a representative of a School of Art called me after I had filled out an application form. First I didn't think back on what he was talking about because it was a long time since I had signed up in this school. After I figured it out he started explaining for me the program that the school offers. Then the conversation ended up that they don't have a graduate program. Afterwards I apologized for misunderstood the program and I hung up the phone.
