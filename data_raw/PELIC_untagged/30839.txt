Comparing Sundays and Fridays can clearly seen in people behaviors and feeling. Also they have been related of some needs such as sleeping working or having free time. Therefore there are many similarities and differences between Sundays and Fridays . In the US usually Fridays are the beginning of the weekend which means no work or wakening up early. Also it is the time for hanging out with friends or family because people are not concern about the next day. In contrast in Sundays people prepare for the first workday that makes them a little bit nervous. They finish working in their assignments homework or other things that have to bee done. In Fridays we feel more relax especially at night and tray to have fun in order to take work stress off. This could be seen in the Fridays afternoon time when some people or students have already finished they leave early and fast. However Sundays we usually keep home and going bed early. Also they are very stressful days and people feel more sad.
