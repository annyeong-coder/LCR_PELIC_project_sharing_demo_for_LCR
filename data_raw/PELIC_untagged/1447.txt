Philip Wiley believe that men and women should live together in this world. Wiley thinks Men are too aggressive to survive on their own so they must be controlled by women. On the other hand Wiley qualifies women as too helpless therefore they need men to stand to help them manage businesses. I share Wiley's opinion. Imagine if women weren't part of our live what would be the world. Both men and women wouldn't be able to live in this earth if either were absent. If men and women learned to live together shared their opinions the world we are living would be a paradise for all of us. Therefore complementarities between men and women must be developed for a better life.
