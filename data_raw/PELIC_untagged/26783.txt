I would like to introduce my classmate. Her name is Dekrayat Khalefa Almaalol. Almaalol is her family name and Khalefa is her father's name. Her name means Memory. She doesn't use any titles with her name. She doesn't like her name as much because she found it was a mouthful. She likes people call her by nickname Dekra but her close friends call her Dode. She comes from Libya to study English in Pittsburgh because she has a plan to study master degree in Physicc in the United States. In Pittsburgh she lives in Melwood St. When she has her free time she likes cooking baking and playing table tennis.
