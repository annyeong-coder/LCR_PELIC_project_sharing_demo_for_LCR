The Chinese New Year always cheers me up and it is coming. My husband and I want to straighten up and re decorate our apartment. We first look over the apartment thoroughly. Then we throw away the staff those we don't need any more and put away the staff we don't use often. Then we tear down the old couplets on the wall and hang up the new ones. We have run out of many daily supplies and we should go to the grocery and buy some. We also want to pick out a new TV and set up an entertainment system.
