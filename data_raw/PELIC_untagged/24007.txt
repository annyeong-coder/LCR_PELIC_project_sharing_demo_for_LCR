There were recognizable effects on the country economy in which people were suffering since 2008. Since the world recession started many companies around the world had affected and had reduced their mass of production which means they will reduce their use of energy. Also Saudi economy depends on the oil production which contributes about 86 percent of the overall country income it is obvious that the economy will hurt if the demand of the oil has diminished. As a result of that the largest oil company has cancelled the yearly merit of their employee and also they did not hire any new employee. Moreover another important sector which is the petrochemical was not far from the oil company in terms of the world recession influences. They lay off a number of employee and the consider budget cutting as a crucial decision regardless of its effects on the community. Another important sector is the banking market since they are directly connected to the world market. They were mostly the most effected sectors. Many employees had been laid off and also most of the people had lost their money in the stock market. To sum up Saudi Arabia is part of the world economy and the effects of the recession have influenced it. However it might be in lower degree than other countries.
