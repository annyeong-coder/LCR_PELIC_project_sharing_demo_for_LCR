I have been having a secret power since 2000. I can hear what people think about in their mind . I was a high school student. By 2000 I had studied hard to prepare my college entrance test since I was senior. I had had to study at school until 9 00p. M. Since then. It had been raining for one week I was on my way home at night. Suddenly there was sounder and lightening I was shocked by light. When I woke up I found out I can hear the voice from people s mind. That was so cool. I can hear my teacher was thinking about the test s answer when I had a test. Also I can know what my friend wanted to get from her birthday when I was preparing her birthday present. I have heard a lot of the real thinking from people. I have recognized who is good person and who is bad guy for eight years. I have learned a lot from everyone s mind also I have gotten a lot of benefits from this superpower. Isn t it cool
