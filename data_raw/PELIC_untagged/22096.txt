My father deth I don't know how to move on from this. Everything I have ever done I did for him. I want nothing but to make him happy and healthy and somewhere we could have that quiet peaceful existance we always talked about. I wanted to see him again. I wanted a chance to keep all the promises I made him. I wanted to make him as proud of me as I was of him. We were supposed to spend it together and he was supposed to be there to convince me that everything is going to be fine. I believe him when he tells me he loves me. I know he would want me to go on with my life even though I warned him many times that if he went first that would be it for me I know he would be disappointed if I gave up this quickly. I just miss him so much sometimes it's a pain that is so intense so huge it's incomprehensible. IN fact that my father is dead is something that is too horrible to deal with but not dealing with it is not making it go away.
