I dont see atractive that way of life because I am completely absorbed in the technology world. Being a monk is very difficult because he has to change all his life I mean learn how to live without technology and other things. I think that the difficult thing for me and mostly because I grow up in a advanced society is the technology because we used all the time. Also they have a lot of restrinctions and I cant live with that for example the code of dresseing. The discipline is very importand in the monastic world but we need discipline for eberything but I think that discipline its no normal for example get up at 5AM withouth the alarm. In conclution I think that the monastic life is not for me and I could t do the same things that the monks do.
