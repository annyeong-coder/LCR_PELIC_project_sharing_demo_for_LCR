Choosing a city to stay and study English for a long time is not easy. Firt we need to think about the environment of the city and people who are living there. For example the city of Pittsburgh is a good place to choose. It has been voted the most suitable city in th U. S. And people are also kind. There are a markable building called Teh Cathedral Of Learning. It is a very good place for students. To sum up I think the ElL of Pittsburgh is a good choice for people who want to improve their English!
