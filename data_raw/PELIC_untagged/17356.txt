Five months ago I filled out an application when I rented my apartment but before I signed up I looked over the lease but I found some mistakes. I talked it over with landlord and we corrected those mistakes. Now I am feeling vary comfortable in this apartment because this apartment is like my old apartment in my country where I grow up. Also there are many things to cheer me up in these apartment such as its location. It is located in a quiet and safe area. My wife also feels very happy she straightens this apartment up and sets every thing up every day. There a big three in front of my apartment I set down under it every evening My advice for any new student who wants to rent an apartment is think to over and pick out the apartment in a good aria.
