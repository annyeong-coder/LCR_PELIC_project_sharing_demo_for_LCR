The Effects of People Have Male Children Rather Than Female Children Recent years there is a phenomenon that people prefer to have male children rather than have female children. It seems like a trend towards in many cultures especially in Asia. Because the cost of having children at this generation is getting more and more heavy than it in many decades ago many families just only want to have only one child. When the parents can choose their child's gender by the advancing technique they usually prefer to have a male child because males are considered to have quality to inherit the prosperity from the parents. However this situation will cause the unbalance in gender of the population and also effect several consequences such as the higher competition the lack of the normal social opportunities and marriage issue. First of all the higher competition will be a crucial influence when the male children grew up. Because of the unbalanced gender of the population it raises much pressure to male . . Second the lack of the normal social opportunities for men is another problem. Many educational theories have been proven that children studying in a diverse environment can improve their learning and creativity. If the population of the men is more than women it will be a pity that male children can not study in a normal learning environment and loose a lot of experiences to practice their social communicate skill with female. Finally the marriage issue is the most important and realistic problem for the male children when they become adults. Due to the overload of male population many men can not look for a girl friend.
