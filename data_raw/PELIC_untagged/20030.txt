There was the accident that a balloon with a 6 year old boy launched. However there was nothing in that balloon and the accident which most people bought was turned out a hoax. The boy was found hiding in his house and his parents made him do that. This show was perpetrated by the boy's silly parents wanting to emerge on a reality TV show which is a trend in entertainment programs. The parents are expected to face a charge and to be evaluated whether they should continue to have custody of their children. The parents initially justified that this accident was not an intended incident but a mishap. However investigators were convinced by a lie detector test for seven hours of interview.
