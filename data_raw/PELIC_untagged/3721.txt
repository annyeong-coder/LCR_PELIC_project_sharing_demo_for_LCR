Betty COULD HAVE TALKED with David about their problems. She SHOULD HAVE TAKEN a prudent attitude when she decided her wedding. She OUGTH NOT TO HAVE AGREED his proposal of marriage until she knew what to do. David WOULD HAVE FOUND an amicable solution if she had complained about their common interest. They will be able to find a common interest. She HAD BETTER LEARN to love David.
