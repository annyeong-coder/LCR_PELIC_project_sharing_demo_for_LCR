A WEEK IN A CAMP About 10 years ago my family and I went to a camp with my uncle and his family. There was a beach near the camp and it was located near Toronto. The water was frigid. When I swam in the sea I was freezing but it felt grate. First in the morning we got up at 8 o'clock. Next we went swimming. After that we came to the shore to get sun bath. Our objective was to have fun and it had a very good benefit for us. We cooked our food on the fire or we ate cans of soup because we don't have gas over there. At night we got around the fire and talk to each other. We slept in the tents. Because there wasn't any lamps over there we used torches at nights. On the last day we went to the beach to collect some nice stones and shells.
