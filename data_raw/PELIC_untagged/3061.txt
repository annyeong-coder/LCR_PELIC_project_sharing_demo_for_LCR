My Tourism Experience Everybody works the most of the year. All of them need some rest in their life. They are not like a machine they can not work all the time. They have to breathe fresh air. Everybody has some problems in their life so when they take a rest and go somewhere and forget everything in their life. This way will help to find a solution for the problems that you have. Also we have to discover something new that we haven't ever seen before. For example go to Egypt to see the pyramids or to China to see the Art Wall of China etc. We don't forget that tourism helps the countries to develop their economy. I had two tourism experiences that two helped me when I was having some problems. The first experience was two years ago. I went to United Arab of Emirate with my family. We visited the Akwa Park and played a lot of games. We visited some museums in Dubai City. We also went to malls and shopped there. There were a lot of international restaurants. I liked one of them which was Gulf Chinese Restaurant. We went to the beach and played soccer there. I forgot everything in my life when I was there. Before I went I was having trouble in my work. After I returned from my vacation I was ready to find the best solution for all problems that I had before leaving. The second tourism experience that I had was in Egypt. I visited Egypt last year as a tourist. I was dyeing to visit Egypt when I was child because I watched the pyramids in the television and I wanted to see them in person. Then I went there and I saw the pyramids. I also saw Abo Alhool's statue. I rode a camel with my friends. It was a fabulous trip. In conclusion tourism is very important for everyone. It is one of the ways to exchange the cultures in the world. It also teaches you new things in your life. I hope that everybody will have a chance to go somewhere and relax.
