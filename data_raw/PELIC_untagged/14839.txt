The worst accident I have ever had. Two weeks ago I was at my apartment and I was visited by some of my friends. Then we left my apartment at 7 00 o'clock. We were driving very fast on Melwood ave and while we were driving we had an accident. Our car was crushed by other car. My face was scared by glasses and one of my friends his arm was broken. After that the cops came and they were investegating us and the other man. I was arrested by the cops because I did not have my driver licen with me. I got off the next day and I learned from my mistakes.
