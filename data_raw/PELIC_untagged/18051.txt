In my point of you wearing cloths which related to religious believes should be a human right unless there are disadvantages from wearing these cloths. However I see that there are no bad outcomes can be obtained from wearing religious clothing. Therefore I would suggest that the French government has to start over and think carefully before doing decisions which might be backfired.
