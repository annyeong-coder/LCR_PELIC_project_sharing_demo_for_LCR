1 Do you think it is important for parents to pass on cooking skills to their children why or why not I think it is important because we have time live alone for example now I live in the United States if I don't know how to cooking I think I can't live too long in the united States. I need someone come to help me to life. And the parents teaching the children how to cooking in life alone. To the children grew up and marred. They can care themselves.
