My friend invited me to go to her birthday party for last time before she moved to other country. Everyone in my class went there but I couldn't go there. I made appointment went out with my sister. I wish I had been there after I finnish shopping. If I hadn't maken the appoinment with my sister I could have been in her party. I wish I have met many my friend and say good bye with her before she moved.
