Seven years ago I traveled to Europe with my parents. In the fifteen days trip we visited eight countries. The most country that memorized me was France. It was a country that filled with artistic ambiance. No matter the theaters or the museums they all had a special style. I liked the constructions there such as Arch of Triumph. Another thing is the perfume. France is famous for that. All in all the journey gave me a lot of experience and it widened my horizen.
