When I get my room back I think I should clean room up because there is dirty a little. I should bring trash away from garbage can and I keep my clothes away from my bed. Sometimes I forget I should turn TV off so when I go my room back I turn it off. Also I put books down rashly in my room. So I have to straighten it up. I find out why my room feel like dirty. Usually I hang my clothes up in clothes chest but sometimes I put it up my chair. It looks like my room is dirty. If I keep on doing that I might give up what I clean my room up.
