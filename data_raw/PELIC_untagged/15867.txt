I received a payment from Magee Women's Hospital I went there for my regular check up that I have with my insurance but I don't know what happened because when I signed up the day of my appointment I let the assistant know about my consult but when I received my bill I found out that they charged me 150 for my appointment when I don't have to pay anything so I called customer service and she asked me to hold on for 15 minutes and when I made my complain and explained them the situation for more than 30 minutes they told me that they will think about it and they will call me back . So after a day they called me back and we talked and she found out some information on the chart and came up with something that I didn't expect the day after my check up I had some doubts and I asked to the doctor about something else and we talked over about a possible treatment on the future so they said this wasn't part of my check up so I needed to paid. Finally she talked to the doctor but they turned down my complain and I figured it out that is just part of the rules so I couldn't do anything so I ended up paying the bill . After this experience I looked over my insurance papers and I checked out certain details that I didn't know I found out that everything is going to be charged.
