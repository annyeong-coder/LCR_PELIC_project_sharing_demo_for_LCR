While I was eating in the restaurant I met a nice boy with beautiful eyes. He looked very intelligent and smart. It was true because he really was. And how did I meet him later I was walking with my dog called Dusty in the park when I saw him again. I was looking at him and He was looking at me. A lot has happened since that time. Than I was playing with Dusty when he came to me and started to speak with me. I was studying English while he was attending Hotels Academy. His name was Tomas. After three months later when he finished his school he moved to Australia to study English. I still remember that time when he was leaving from my life. I was crying every day. And how did everything end We are still together and I hope that forever.
