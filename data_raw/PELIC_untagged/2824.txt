No I disagree I thing the good luck must follow your work to be successful. Sometimes you do every things to success but the but you don't have luck so you lose or fial. For example when I was in saudi arabia I took classes in king abdul azeez university and I was very good student. I was asking a question caming on time and studying hard. But the professor dead after the first month. And there were no another professor to give this course so we waited until they find one who had some free time to give us the course. But when did they got him. Believet or not in the last tow week. In addition the didn't permit us to withdrowl it so I took F in that class and it was because the bad luck. So obslotly the good luck is a reason to successed
