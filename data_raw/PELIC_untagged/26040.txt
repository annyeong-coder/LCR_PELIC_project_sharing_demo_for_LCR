Dear Mr. ANON_NAME_0 I am a student at the EFL Computer Training Institute. My classes are very good but the Institute had better make some improvements or many students are going to leave. First I think you should clean the room up and make it now. Second you should change the Furniture. You should fix everything in room because some if them did not work good. You should make a Schedule meeting for the student. And you ought to bring more teachers for the student to get better education.
