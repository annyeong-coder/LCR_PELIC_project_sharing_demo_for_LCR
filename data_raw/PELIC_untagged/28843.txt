TOPIC 1 Viewpoint A Standardized tests are important for universities admissions in those days. So every student wants to apply for any of Americans universities he should has one or two of the standardized tests . But the universities should not pay too much attention to the standardized test scores . These tests do not evaluate the level of the student precisely. In addition it is too difficult to get high scores with short time studying. Many students who are coming for abroad studying they should have the tests . So they are not familiar with way of studying and how these tests done. Some students are smart and inttelegent but whe they do the exams for the first time they do not reach high scores. Despite they are good they may fail. However some students they do not know a lot about the exams but they succeed and they get high scores. I think that those tests do not evaluate the level of the student in the correct way. In addition It is too much difficult to get high scores when students study for a short time. If students want to reach high scores they should spend long time for studying. Consequently their time will be lost in studing only. Some people believe that it is hard to evaluate applicants without objective data. So they must get those standardized tests. They recommend that each university ask students for these tests. Also some teachers believe that the tests are related with universities lectures . And they can help students to deal with the lectures more comfortable.
