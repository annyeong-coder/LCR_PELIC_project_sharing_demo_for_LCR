Actually there are many dinning taboos in my country. One of them When you eat you must use your right hand during eat and say besm Allah before eating so when someone use his left hand during eating he will see a lot of criticisms due to his behavior . Second taboo when you invite your guest to dinner and you are on the dinning table you have to wait until the guest start to eat.
