My cozy bedroom Every person has his own privacy and his own personal life. For instance I have my own bedroom that I feel comfortable and relax in it. As you inter the room you face the bed which is like the kings bed in his shape and in its look. Next to the bed there is my desk which is full of papers and lots of stuff. In front of the desk there is a big picture of statue of liberty its really big picture that's gives you a big pouch to the future. The flour is messy there are many things dropt pens papers magazines. To the right of the picture there are my closet it's another world there it's really a big closet but still messy. I have my clothes every were inside the closet some in the flour and some in there places. I have a small table that has wheals so it can be moved more easer but some times I cant remember were did I see it last time. So I have to search for it and who ever sees me looking for the small table think that I am playing hide and seek. In general I can picture my bedroom like New York City it's big and beautiful but it's crowded and messy also some times you have difficulty looking for something.
