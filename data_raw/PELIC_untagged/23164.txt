Movies and books affect each other. Sometimes famous books transfer to movies including Da Vinci code the Harry Potter series and Perfume. Da Vinci code is one of the successful movies from the book and the movie has different aspects from the book. The movie Da Vinci code clarifies people's ambiguous imagination. In the novel the story starts in Paris at the Louvre museum but if you have not visited there you probably cannot imagine the specific spaces. However in the movie you can see the Louvre museum from a small room to the whole structure and actors' playing in that place clearly. On the other hands sometimes movies from books give different pictures from our imagination. For example we imagine main characters as certain characteristics. You can imagine Dr. ANON_NAME_0 Langdon as a very sharp person with thin and tall appearance. However in the movie the Dr. Langdon was Tom Hanks whose image is friendly a man next door. It is said that making a movie from the book is a common trend in the movie industry. Also movies from books give us a special fun to compare each other.
