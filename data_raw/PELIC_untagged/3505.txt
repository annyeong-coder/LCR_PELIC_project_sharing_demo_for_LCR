Dear my Honey Honey I'm thinking about buying a new camera. I got a new clothes website so I need a new camera but I don't know which one is a good camera. I already found 2 attractive items. The costs of these 2 items are very different but these are from the same brand. I thought about many camera but canon brand is very good for taking pictures. These camera are 300D and 500XD. 300D is more expensive then 500XD. I survey about many website and I saw clothing pictures carefully. And than I knew what which camera is good or not. Many clothing website owners own 500XD. This camera is good What color sense if I take picture of clothes. This camera is automatic. However I want to buy 300D but 300D camera is manual operation so it treat very hard and very expensive. What do you think I'm really don't know which to buy. From Eli.
