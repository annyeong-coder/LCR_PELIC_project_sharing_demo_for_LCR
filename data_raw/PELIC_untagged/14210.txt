The best mirror is an old friend. I completely agree with that sentence because an old friend is someone who can show you past. It's someone who knows all your history is like an album. An old friend is the person who shared with you all happiest moments and the saddest too. It's someone who helped you even at the worst moment and someone who you always can account on. One of my oldest friend is Gina we met on our first day of classes in kinder garden many years ago. We always remember that day because we both were the new students that year. She is a girl who is always thinking about travelling she never spends more than 1 year in the same place. The last place was Tahiti beaches which is a very beautiful place to relax I saw her pictures . I really miss this crazy girl but is ok because I know that one day or another she will be here knocking my door or maybe I will knock hers.
