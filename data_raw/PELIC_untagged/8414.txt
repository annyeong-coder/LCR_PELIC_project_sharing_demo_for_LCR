I spend about 400 every month. I think that I am spending too much money so I need to save money. First I should pack a lunch box. I pay 7 for lunch everyday. If I pack a lunch box I would be able to save at least 100. Second I have to call to Korea few times. I call my parents and friends many times. That is why I buy a prepaid card once a month which costs 50. Rather than calling them I will have to focus on studying. Lastly I need to reduce the number of buying clothes. Even though I have plenty of clothes I have gone shopping to buy clothes five times a month. Therefore I should not buy them any more. If I carry out the three things I would be able to save at least 200. I will perform these things immediately to make a lot of money.
