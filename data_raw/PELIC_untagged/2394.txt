Hi! This website is for everyone who are interested in Opera history. I lived in Italy in 2002. I was interested in opera history. So I went to Santa Cecilia academy in Italy. I have studied there for one year. I have seen many great artists when I went to Concerts. I saw traditional opera music of Italy. I bought many classical music CDs and I have been listening classical music CDs for a long time. When I have graduated there after one year. I have collected so many classical music CDs and many books about opera.
