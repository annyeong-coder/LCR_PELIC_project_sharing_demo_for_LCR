My mother made a difference in my life In my life one of the most important people is my mother. She earns money for my studying. She also supports me to do other things as well. She is like my soul friend and teaches me things I can do and some things I can not do. For example she taught me how to cook food and how to arrange things nice and how to treat other people well. My mother protects me from dangerous things and she is always on my side.
