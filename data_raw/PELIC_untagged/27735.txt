After I drank a lot of alcohol up I used to make a mistake to my friends on the phone. Drinking it a lot ended up with making my friends feel angry and embarrassed. One day I played a practical joke to my friend on the phone while I was much drinking beer. I wasn't even able to remember anything I did last night when I woke up in the next morning. The day after making a mistake I called my friend up to be forgiven by him. However He turned my apology down because he couldn't figure out my mistake at first time. In the end of talking him into to accept my apology he picked it up!
