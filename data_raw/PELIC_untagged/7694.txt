I met my friend Andy while I was in the army. He was a man under my command. However we were close with each other. We had raid training two times a year. While we were training he always followed me. When we had mealtime even though I wasn't in command he got my meal for me. He said he respected me as his leader. I also thought he was a good soldier. When I was discharged from army he still was in army. Nevertheless he has been keeping touch with me even until now. When I finished last semester I went to LA because of him. He is living in Los Angeles. When I arrived in LA he welcomed me with joy and we had a good time. Now he always recommends my moving to LA. So I'm thinking about it because he has become my best friend and I want to spent time with him.
