Ex12 P219 Everyone has several significant friends in whole life. When I was in the university there several friends have positive effects on my mind. Mr. ANON_NAME_0 who works for TSMC is my senior and he is my best friend who lives near my hometown. When I studied in the university he had already transferred from the other university. In addition he changed major when he had been studying in this university which I studied. Therefor he needed to select several course that are different with he studied before so sometime we studied the same courses. We have the same interests such as we like to watch motorcycle race we like to do exercise and watch movies. When I applied the graduate schools he had provided several opinions which were useful for me help me to figure out my goal. He told me how to prepare for graduate schools applied. Miss Lin is his girlfriend who treats me very well also. Finally I had participated in their wedding ceremony before I came to the U. S. They still provide me some suggestions which for my career.
