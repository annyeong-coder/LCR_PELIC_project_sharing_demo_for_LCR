The most things I have learned in writing3 this semester is how to express ideas. Before I took this class I had difficulty expressing ideas when I wrote. I didn't know How I should start to write What I should write How I can connect the sentences Now I am getting a little bit better. I know more English concepts and I have more ideas when I write. I have not learned only the ideas but I also have gained more skills and I know more words. All these things help me when I write now. I know how to write a good paragraph and essay. Moreover this subject is very useful for my work in the future. However one of my problem in this time is that I don't like to write. Writing is my least favorite subject because it is very hard for me. I know I do not write as well as I could. I hope one day I can change this feeling. I will probably do it better. If I can become a better writer I will be happy.
