This is the night scene of Brooklyn Bridge in New York City. I was in New Jerjey on my last vacation for three weeks. A place that I lived for three weeks was named Edgewater and it was just nearby Hudson River. Everyday I could see all the vista of the Manhattan. The Manhattan it was a perfect city that I've never seen before. Especially the night scene was very beautiful charming and impressive. In this picture we can see the Hudson River which passes under a bridge. Across the river we can meet the lower Manhattan. The main point of picture might be Brooklyn Bridge in the center. At night this bridge is wonderful beyond expression. Actually because of a shinning back view of lower Manhattan the bridge can't tell how nice it is. Even so it is not enough to describe in words. Also in the picture I can see gorgeous buildings bright colors of lights a river exposed to the light. There is Empire state building which is almost sky high in off center of picture. This building makes us feel the others are low buildings which are enough tall though. In my opinion if you didn't go this well known building even you went to N. Y city you would be sorry for that. I recommend you strongly.
