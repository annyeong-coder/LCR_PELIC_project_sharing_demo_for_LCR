I am ANON_NAME_0 Last Name . I like the English Language very much. That is the main reason why I am studying English in the ELI now. I am also improving my English to be able to study for my PhD. I was previously studying in the ELS at Point Park University however I like the ELI more. The things I like most is playing tennis and skiing. It is difficult to have enough time and money to do everything you want to do in the US Although I am making many friends and having a lot of fun. I also like to explore new places every weekend. I feel so excited now because I am visiting some friends in New York this weekend.
