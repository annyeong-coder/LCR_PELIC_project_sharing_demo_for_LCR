I have been looking up house rental on the internet since I was in Taiwan. But there is no one calling me back after I have arrived in Pittsburgh. Finally I found a beautiful house which is located at Squirrel Hill. At a first glance I fell in love with this lovely home after I thought over the rental the house was becoming my new home. On the first day I got up early to set up my new room. There are three windows in the room so I opened them to light the room up. I think a bright place will straighten the room up and make me have positive attitude. After then I hung up my clothes in the big closet. I really excited that having new life with my adorable room in three months.
