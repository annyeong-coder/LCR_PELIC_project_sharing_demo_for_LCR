My mother. My family is a harmonious family. We come to an understanding each other. I love my family but among them the best person is my mother. She always worry about family care for family and sacrifice herself for family. Also she has a good thing that is a cooking. My mother is a very good cook and she was a cooking teacher for many years. She is a average height and has short gray and brown curly hair. She has dark brown eyes. She usually wears a T shirt and slacks. She likes comfortable and natural clothes. She looks plump. My mother always has a beautiful and mild smile but when she teached cook she was serious and strict person. When she had taught cook to people she was a stern and aggressive teacher. She had a passion about Korea food and always prepared for class. She focused on her job. Now she is retired from her job. Nowadays she has a hobby. Her hobby is gardening. She loves plants and grows many kinds of flowers. Therefore she is more mellow than before. She is a lovely mother and grandmother. I hope that my mother lives a long time and healthy life. When I go back to korea I will spend time with my mother. At that time I want to learn how to cook to my mother. After that I hope that I become a good cook and I spend time with my mother in the kitchen.
