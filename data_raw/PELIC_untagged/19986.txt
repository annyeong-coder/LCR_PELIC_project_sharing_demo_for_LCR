The story of the Prodigal Brother written by Lucy Maud Montgomery is about a woman named Hannah who lived in a little grey house far down the shore and hoping that her brother who ran away 20 years ago would come back with a success of being rich and take care of her. Hannah was a lonely woman since the parents passed away. But she was strong enough to survive because of the positive manner that soon Ralph will come back as he wrote on the note before he disappeared. In November while she was trying to forget about her garden by enjoying the frost air outside the house suddenly the brother showed up. It was an excited moment to Hannah even though when Ralph didn't reach his goal to her love and happiness covered everything.
