When I learned how to play golf and how to swing perfectly my friend made me to practice hard. My friend kindly helped me to have good swing and posture. By the time when I got familiar with my swing on the range my friend made me to go out for to play on the course. I practiced really hard to get myself to be used to it. When I got to be independent I made my own practice routine to get more higher level. Now days a lot of friends asked me to teach them how to play golf well. My basic answer for this question is to have yourself feel comfortable first and get yourself to practice hard like me before.
