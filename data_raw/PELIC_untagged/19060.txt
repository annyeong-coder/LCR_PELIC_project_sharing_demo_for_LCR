My sister helped me to learn English. Before I came here I didn t trust myself but she got me to trust myself. First she had me research about language school which teaches English but I couldn t find anywhere. She helped me to find ELI. After I came the U. S. A she made me learn new vocabulary and speak a lot. She didn t let me speak Turkish with my Turkish friends to learn English quickly but she let me make a mistake when I speak. She never made me fell uncomfortable. So I always thank her a lot.
