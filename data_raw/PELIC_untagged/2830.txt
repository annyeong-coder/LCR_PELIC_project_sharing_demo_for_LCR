My room is very comfortable. And everyday I can feel freshly because sunshine wakes me up in the morning through my window which is near my bed. But the one thing that always let me down is messy. Frankly speaking I try to put my stuffs away to clean my room everyday. However my room is always untidy. I couldn't figure out why my room gets messy so quickly. I thought about it a lot and finally I could find out it. I always tried my clothes on and I didn't put them in the right place. I have to change my bad habit.
