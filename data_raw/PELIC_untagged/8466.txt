My room is snug and so comfortable. The room always cheers me up and helps me to be relax. However it's too dark to study in my room. It doesn't matter to me to recognize what's what and figure out what to do but It has been bringing me down. So I decided to change the lamp with new bright one to light up my room. I'll also put up some movie posters and I should touch up the walls with new paint. Finally It would be nice to throw out my broken vacuum cleaner and straighten up my desk. Disorder desk. With just a few small changes I'll end up feeling happier in my room. It's worth trying out.
