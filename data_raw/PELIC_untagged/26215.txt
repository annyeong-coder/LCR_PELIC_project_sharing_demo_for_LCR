Would you travel a long distance to see an event like the Sapporo Ice Festival Why or why not Yes. If I could travel to Japan I would like to go when this festival is celebrated. I appreciate art and I have never seen anything like this festival before. I cannot imagine how artists create snow sculptures and ice statues. The recreation of famous buildings and monuments sounds attractive to me. I find it interesting how people from all over the world have joined this festival not only colder countries like the text mentioned but also countries from warmer climates such as Hong ANON_NAME_0 and Hawaii. I like the way that this festival was started and how it has become an icon in Japan. Furthermore the lecture mentioned something about the great warmth that this festival brings to Japanese culture and I agree with that. I think this is a good way to enjoy the coldest season of the year. Absolutely if I had the opportunity to live this experience I would do it.
