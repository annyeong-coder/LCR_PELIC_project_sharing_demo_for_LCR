I have seen a movie is called Fighter. It talks about one person and his brother is catch. They are competitive with other. His brother is drug abuse arrested by police. The fighter finding a new catch started to win in many competitive. His brother went out from jail having tried to return the catch. After that the fighter and his brother cooperated together all of whom are popular in the many competitive. In this movie there are many helpers most of whose helpers got prizes. One thing I didn't like it in the movie is that the style of movie look like old. The second thing is that I felt I could know who was the winner between fighters. Two things I like it in the movie are fighter try hard to achieve his goal and some friends tried to help him.
