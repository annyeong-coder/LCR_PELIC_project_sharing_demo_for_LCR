My friend had many challenges in his life. He is blind. He couldn't use a PC. He used to study with someone who assists him. But now he uses a software which helps him to do his tasks. He couldn't study alone but now he almost able to study without any helping from people. I admire him because he didn't think about negative thoughts and he didn't give up. He finished his bachelor degree and now he is studying for his master degree.
