I came here from Ankara Turkey. Ankara is the most important city because it is capital city. Also Ankara is political city because all the goverment buildings in Ankara. Ankara has many important places to visit. For example there is a park its called Kugulu Park. It is the most important park because it is the oldest. In addition there is the tallest building. From this building you can see the whole city. Ankara's nights are famous because many night clubs cafe restaurant in Ankara. If you want to get enjoy you can go wherever you want. Ankara is the bigger city. Almost 5 million people live in there. Ankara is very cold in during a winter time but in the summer it is real hot. I've been living in the U. S for 10 months and I see some similar things between Ankara and Pittsburgh. For instance the wheater is like same and the most interesting similar thing is people. In Ankara almost eveyone usually goes work and the streets are very crowded. In the Pittsburgh it is same. For the end I like my Hometown and I missed live in there.
