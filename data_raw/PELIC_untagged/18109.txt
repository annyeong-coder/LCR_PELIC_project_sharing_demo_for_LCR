My family is four father mother younger brother and me. My father who is working at University really likes mountain climbing. He usually goes up a mountain every weekend. My mother who is an elementary school teacher is weak. She is not good at doing exercise. My younger brother who is a senior is a mischief. My family used to travel a place of scenic beauty when I was young. When I was a high school student I went up a high mountain. We traveled a north place where has a famous mountain. We climbed the day when we were a summer vacation. We started climbing in the early morning when even I didn't weak up. My father expected conquering the summit of Mt. Seolak. The mountain which has the height of 1776Km is the 3rd highest Mountain in Korea. My mother and I were trying to go up the Mt. Of Seolak but we couldn't climb anymore. My father imposed us on conquering the summit of Mt . Seolak so I had to climb the Mt. There was dark when I went down a mountain. I couldn't walk anymore but I was very happy to conquer the summit of Mt. Seolak. Everybody who climbed the mountain was safe. It was unforgettable memory in my life.
