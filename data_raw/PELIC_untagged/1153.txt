My worst meal experience that I had was two years ago. I went with a group to Al Medina. The group was divided to two parts. The first part is the visitors. Visitors are the people who pay to travel to Al Medina. The second part is al kawader. Al kawader are people who prepare every thing for the visitors such as food and competitions. Al kawader don't pay any thing when they want to go. The manger of this group wanted to repay al kawader because they worked hard and I am one of al kawader. He invited us to a restaurant and he told us to order whatever we want. After we ordered many things like fresh juice hamburgers and pizzas we were waiting for the food for more than an hour at that restaurant. We told the manger that we are waiting for the food and now it is more than an hour of waiting. He was so angry about that and we left that restaurant to go to another one. Some of al kawader didn't want to eat after that restaurant so the manger was so shamed but a lot of us ate in the other restaurant. Therefore we were waiting for the whole night at that day.
