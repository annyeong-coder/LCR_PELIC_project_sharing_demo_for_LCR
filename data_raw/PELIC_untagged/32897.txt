Why do want to improve your writing skill Lot of reasons makes me want to develop my writing skills. Because everybody wants to be successful regardless of the type of work they do writing is a part of it. When I improve my writing skill I'll achieve my goals taking the master's degree in nursing moreover I'll return to my country specifically to my work with self confidence. First achieving my Master's degree goal initially I have to pass lot of tests such as the TOFEL test. In addition at the university level the way I write can help my teachers understand me well in contrast they will evaluate me and of course it will impact to my score. Second when I'll return to my country with Master's especially in my work I'll be under the eyes. So I can write e mails proposals and project plans without fear. Ineffective and poor writing can negatively impact to my work so what I write tell my boss about my intelligence. Improving my writing skills may take some time but it will benefit me for the rest of my life and the good point it's not possible to achieve that goal just little time of practice.
