My best roommate is Eason because he is honest and he and I often have similar ideas. For example we don' have pets. We have similar hobbies such as watch listen to music and etc. He likes to cook deferent food for dinner and also I love to cook deferent food for lunch. We like to clean so we don't have problem for it. We don't smoke. Other reasons for I chose him because we have similar schedule. For example he often wakes up relay at 6 30 and I wake up at 6 00. He doesn't a take shower in the morning but I usually take a shower in the morning so it is good for us. We often go to school at 8 30AM and we go back to home at 6 00PM so we will be good for us because we will go together. He usually eats his dinner at 6 30 but I eat my dinner at 7 15. We have similar evening and weekend activities such as shopping walking watch and etc.
