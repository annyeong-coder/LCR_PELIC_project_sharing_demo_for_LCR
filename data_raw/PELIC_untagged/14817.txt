When I was walking on the Fifth Street I have witnessed a car accident. The accident was caused by a car whose driver was a young man. When he was driving from Oakland to Shadyside he did not see a traffic light red on the Wilkins Avenue. Then his car hit a car which was coming from the different direction. The car was driven by an old woman. She was fine and coming out of her car though I was very worried if she was well or not. The side of her car was terribly crashed. The windows and mirrors were smashed to pieces. Unfortunately the hood of his car was destroyed completely. He seemed to turn pale with fear. Because he was not sure how much she would demand to have her car fixed. He also needed to have his car fixed. His savings must be used up due to the car accident.
