I picked my apartment out because it has a balcony and large windows. The balcony is wide so I set some plants up there. The balcony is on the north direction so I feel comfortable in summer because it is not too hot. On the other hand I feel dark and cold in winter time. I need to light my living room up even if the daytime. I have been living in my apartment for 2 years so I feel getting tired of the decorations in my room. I want to move my furniture around to change my mood but it is difficult to change because there is not enough space. I have hung up same pictures on the wall since I moved in so I want to pick new pictures up. I tend not to put my stuff back in my room so I sometimes have to clean up my apartment. It is difficult for me to keep my room well organized but I should do.
