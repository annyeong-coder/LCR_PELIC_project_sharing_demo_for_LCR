I came from Korea this year but I have been living here in Pittsburgh for 5 month. I have attended 1 semester at the ELI already. My English comunication skills are better than befor because I have been studying everyday in the Hillman libery after the ELI classes. My hobby has changed since I arrived here. In my country I used to play soccer. My hobby has changed to jogging in Mount Washington since I have been living here in Mount Washington. In addition I love books. I have been reading a Korean book for 1 month. I have read 5 books about business after I have lived in the U. S.
