Recently the old popular show Frends is on again. I watch it from time to time. It always make me laugh even though I have watched some episodes more than twice. One funny story is that Joey is dating a girl and thinks that he has dated her before. In the beginning Joey was talking to Rachel in the coffee shop. Then Rachel left Joey saw this beautiful girl and said hot . However the girl heard it and she thought Joey good looking too. Later Joey and the girl ANON_NAME_0 started chatting. What was funny about it was that ANON_NAME_0 thought Joey was shy. While they were talking the guy behind the bar started to laugh and made noise every time Joey agreed with ANON_NAME_0 about him being shy and not asking girls out much. What ANON_NAME_0 didn't know about Joey was that Joey changed girl friends all the time. Later on Joey was invited to ANON_NAME_0's apartment. While ANON_NAME_0 was bathroom Joey took a look at her apartment and found it strange that he thought he had been here before. He took close look at the sofas and was certain that he had been here. However he couldn't remember ANON_NAME_0. After Joey went back to his apartment and told his friends about that he was dating a girl that he might dated before. That ANON_NAME_0 couldn't remember him really bothered Joey as he was very confident that he was unforgettable. Next he decided to date ANON_NAME_0 again. During their date Joey couldn't resist and asked the question why ANON_NAME_0 couldn't remember him. However ANON_NAME_0 still couldn't remember him. It solved the puzzle when ANON_NAME_0's roommate arrived home. Joey dated ANON_NAME_0's roommate before but not ANON_NAME_0 and it was obvious that ANON_NAME_0's roommate still remembered him. She hated Joey that he never called back after their first date. That he was kicked out by these two girls didn't hurt Joey's feeling at all in contrast it satisfied Joey's need for pride.
