Things like having a test or writing a long essay causes a lot of pressure for most of the students. As students we feel that teachers put pressure on us by giving us a lot of assignments. There are many causes for this pressure such as final examinations homework presentations and quizzes. I think the most common causes are finals homework and presentations. The most important reason that makes finals cause pressure is the fact that those exams take a big proportion of the final grade. Therefore if the student did not do well on an exam he lost many grades. That even if he did well in participating in the class and homework. Long homework causes most of the pressure because all over the year.
