My apartment always makes me feel calm and inspired. This place and its interior really cheer me up whenever I need rest from the outside world. It never turn me down. I look over the place and feel good with the decoration and furniture that I have. My husband hung up a big picture of us in a living room and put up a wall candles decoration next to it. There ware a fresh flower on the coffee table but I threw it out after it withered. I set up a daily schedule and a 'house's rules notice' and put up at the fridge as a reminder to keep this apartment clean and bright. I will straighten up the living room kitchen and bedroom daily. Never throw away a cloth rubbish and book everywhere. I will definitely put the book back after I take them off from the shelves and hang up the clean clothes or jacket after use. The only thing that makes me feel bad about this apartment is that I can't turn the stove around. It attached with the kitchen cabinet and I can't move it around. I like it to be at the corner next to the window. However my husband said that I still can make up the kitchen by keeping it tidy and clean. He added I don't have to count on the stove to make my apartment perfect. To think over it I noticed that he was right!
