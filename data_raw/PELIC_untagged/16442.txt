Although many people are optimistic with the online dating I am still considering it is as not the ideal way of choosing the real partner. Because deprivation from real meeting as well as inattentive speaking and listening that occurs in virtual dating can sometimes misleading. So I do advice people to not relay on this method to choose their partner. Instead every one should depend on the traditional ways in order to make an effective and long term relationship.
