ZZ whose baby is 2 years old is one of my best friends. I got to know her in the institute that I studied for my master degree. At that time she was my tutor whose job was guiding me. She is fun. I felt happy whenever I worked with her together. She also is a good player who is good at many sports such as Ping pang bowling swimming and etc. Sometimes I feel she is the right one who can really understand me. Her hometown which is in the south of China is very beautiful. I have been there. I miss her very much.
