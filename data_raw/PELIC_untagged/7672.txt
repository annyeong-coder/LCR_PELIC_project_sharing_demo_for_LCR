The Seongsu Bridge is one of the most beautiful bridges over the Han River in Seoul Korea. However the Seongsu Bridge recalls terrible memory. It was 3 years ago. The bridge collapsed early in the morning when people went to school and work. In the accident 32 people were killed and 17 were injured. The bridge was completed in 1979. At that time a company had this construction of bridge commissioned but they used improper materials. After the accident the bridge was supposed to repair but because of weakness in the structure it had to be rebuilt completely. New bridge was redesigned as similar as old one and a small memorial park was made under the bridge due to remember such sorrow time. The accident was occurred by human not nature so after the accident government addressed how important people's or company's moral was.
