If I received a gift of enough money I would buy some classical music CDs at first. I like to listen to music especially classical music. I usually turn on the classic radio channel at home. Sometimes I really want to listen to that classical music again. So if I buy the CD which consists of the music that I am looking for I could hear anytime anywhere when I want to listen to it. The second thing that I want to buy is interesting books. I can borrow the books in the library but sometimes there are some books which I want to keep. So before buying the book I will look up the internet where I can find out the list of books which I am interested in. This could be a chance of making my knowledge more proficient and thinking myself over again. Last thing that I want to do is saving the rest of the money. Money is for using it. Even so we can save it for bad time. In addition I don't want it now but sometimes it will be likely to happen that I am eager to buy something fancy when I find it. So I will keep it for future. In conclusion the reason to give a gift of money instead of other present might expect that money will used in good way. So I am going to buy something which is really necessary for me if I could get a gift of money.
