Panera Bread is my preferred restaurant to have lunch in town. First of all I love the food its really tasty and is always fresh beside they have these you pick two menu witch you get to chose one soup and half of sandwich making the meal more healthy and also these menu has a very good price just 6 39. I always pick the same soup broccoli and cheddar cheese is my favorite and I try to eat different sandwiches each time so I don't get tired of eating every day the same food. Another good aspect of Panera is the location I always can find one in my way making it very practical for me. Finally I enjoy Panera's environment is very warm in there they have these tables with some couches that makes the place very comfortable. Basically Panera Bread is my favorite restaurant for 3 reasons the good food the location and his environment.
