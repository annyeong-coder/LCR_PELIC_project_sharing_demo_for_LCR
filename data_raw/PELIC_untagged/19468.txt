When I met her in the medical school I was fifteen years old. While I was taking a book from bookshelf in the library we bumped and her books dropped from her hand. I apologized and helped her pick up the books. In this way our relationship started. She was a very good student and organized person. She was studying very much. She never studied in noisy places. While she was studying she was focusing on her homework perfectly. When she had time at the weekends we went to movies or set in a cafe near the sea. One day while we were sitting in the cafe she told me that she was feeling very sick. I took her immediately to a hospital. While the doctors were examining her carefully I was worried about her situation. After the exemination I asked one of the doctors about her situation. He told me that she did not have any serious problem. She felt sick because she was too tired. When the doctor finished talking. I felt very happy.
