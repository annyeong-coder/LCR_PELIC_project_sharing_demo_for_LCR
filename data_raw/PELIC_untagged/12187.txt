I have a younger brother who is 3 years younger than I am. Before I came here we had been living together with our parents for 21 years. Even though we were borned from same parents had been living for many years we have many differences. First our appearance is different. When we went out together most people did not think that we are brother and sister. After we said that we were brother and sister they surprised about it. My brother looks like my father and I look like my mother. Also our personalities are different. My brother is kind but he is lazy not caution. And I am sensitive complicated and caution. Obviously we have different personalities so we often misunderstood each other's mind opinion. Second we share different hobby. Sometimes we stayed at home but we hard to play together. We are interested in different things. My brother loves sleeping playing computer games. He has time he just did these things. On the other hand I love shopping listening to music. Even though we went to shop together he could not stay with me for a long time. He wanted to go back home quickly. So I could not shop with him very well. And we also have different special skills. He is good at Math. English but I am good at Literature Chinese. So we could ask to each other questions that we did not know. Even though we are brother and sister we have many differences.
