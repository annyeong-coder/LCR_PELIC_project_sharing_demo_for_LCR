One of the best movies I've seen recently is Titanic directed by James Cameron. This movie is about the romantic. A rich girl and poor boy who meet on the ship. The director and most of whose movie actors won in oscar. The actors none of whom are famous before this film. Finally it was a great movie some of which is true.
