Mc Donald s products seem tastely but it will not be our main eating habit. We should eat them only we need them realyy. May be we didnt eat anything in a day and we hadnt time prepare or cook something. Only in this situation we can eat there. Otherwise we shouldnt choose fast food restuarants. Beacuse fast foods products don t include involve enough nutrition values that we need to take regularly. They should be always second option. Firstly we have to try eat at home and choose more healthy foods that include high nutrition values.
