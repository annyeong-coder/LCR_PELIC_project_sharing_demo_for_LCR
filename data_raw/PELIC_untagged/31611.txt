Avoid grabbing and drinking from the wrong glass. Left handed people can face inconveniences at school too. Consider the chairs in classrooms with little fold up desktops for taking notes. Most of them are made for right handers. Left handers have to write with left elbow hanging in midair or else turn themselves around almost 180 degrees in order to lay their notebook on desk . Furthermore when lefties writer in three ring binder or spiral notebook the rings get in the way of their hands when the writer on the front side of a page. Finally left handers write from left to right their hand smears the fresh ink across the page. Last but not least are the many inventions of the modern world that make life convenient for right handers but inconvenient for lefties. These include scissors can openers corkscrews automobile gear shifts cameras and computer computers keyboards. In sum in a world organized for right handed people must confront and overcome challenges every day.
