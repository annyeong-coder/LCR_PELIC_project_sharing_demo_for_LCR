I have many friends. Above all I'd like to talk my best friend who is very kind. We met 2002 when we cram to repeat a college entrance exam. He is short guy whose height is just 160 cm. However he always has confidence. Sometimes when I had some problems he encouraged to me. For example 3years ago I went army. At that time I was difficult to adapt to new circumstances. One day he visited in my bunker which is located in country. My bunker is very faraway from his house but he visited my bunker for encourage to me so I deeply appreciated him. These days I can't meet him so I am really missing him. I connect with him to use messenger that is Korean company's program. This coming summer vacation he will come to Pittsburgh because he wants to meet me so I will go to travel somewhere that is the good attractions. I really look forward to him.
