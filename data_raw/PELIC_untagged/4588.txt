I would live in past to study harder again because there were many good reasons. Fiest of all you can be rejuvenated which means that your brain is also young so you can memorize quickly what you learnas far as you study. Now I feel taht my brain is dieing and it's very hard for me to learn new things and remember them. I want to learn ot but my brain can't keep up with it. That's the most stuggle things when you are getting older so if I could live in past I could do what I want to do the most. Second of all I could see some people who had already died such as my grandparents relatives and friends. Actually my paternal grandparents had passed away before I was born so I always think that I want to see them and talk with them. I can also know my parenats childfood from them because my parents don't tell me about it so I'm intersted in it. I used to think about only future but I think it would be fun to get back to past as well. Returning and linving in past must be exciting and benefit for my life.
