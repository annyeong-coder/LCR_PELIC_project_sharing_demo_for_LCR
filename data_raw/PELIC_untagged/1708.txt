No person fits one type of personality completely but people are closer to a type than another. Similarly I am one of the people who have the most of their personality from one type and some of another one. On the category of people's energy I am an extrovert more than an introvert. My energies are activated by the people whom I am with but sometimes I like to be alone and go to places that I feel comfortable in. However on the category of the kind of information we notice and remember I am not closer to one than the other. Sometimes I could be very practical and think on the material and sometimes I think about the relationship between it and the people who has it. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
