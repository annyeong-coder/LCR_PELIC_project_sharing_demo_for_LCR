Jason has been to more than 5 countries for 10 years. For example he went to Japan by himself couple months ago. He has bought his expensive camera in Korea. So he's taken pictures in abundance in Japan. An addition he's shopped many designed clothes in his trip in Japan. He enjoyed his tour by looking around the all novel things. Furthermore he's learned Japanese in his country. He could travel by speaking a little Japanese. However he hasn't earned money by himself. But his parents have given him money for expense.
