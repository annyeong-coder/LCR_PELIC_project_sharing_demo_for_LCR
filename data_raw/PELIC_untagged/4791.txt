The Changing Role of Women Woman's role in this society has changed dramatically in the last century. More than 100 years ago most women were treated as only housewives. Their life's goals included staying at home all day doing house chores having a large family and raising the children. However in most countries today many women not only perform very well in their education and their occupation they also share the same responsibilities as men. Many women today have very high educational degrees. Families today think that not only their sons need to go to school. 100 Years ago it would not be very easy to receive degrees for women. Most women today have at least university degrees and some even have Master's degrees or Doctor's degrees. They have degrees in many difficult fields such as engineering computer astronomy and medicine. Many women today also have very high paying occupations. There are women in many kinds of professions. Many big companies have female businesswomen. Many doctors engineers and astronomers in science today are also female. A lot of women have also become influential politicians in many countries. This is very different from 100 years ago when most women stayed at home to cook and raise children. Women today share the same responsibilities as men. Many husbands and wives today share house work at home. Some husbands sometimes even cook for the family. Today's women also work hard to earn money for their families. Husbands are not the only authority in most families anymore. The role of women in today's world is very different from the role they had 100 years ago. Women today work hard in school to receive high level degrees. Women today also do well in many jobs that only men could do 100 years ago. Finally today's women share a lot of family responsibilities with men. Most of them do not just depend on their husbands anymore. The role of woman will keep changing and improving and women will have even better roles in the future.
