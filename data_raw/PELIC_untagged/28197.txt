A best friend is who might be another you. Maybe but I don't think so. I have a friend who have totally different personality from mine. I'm very easy going but she is very shy. I can meet new friends in short time. Even thought she is shy but she have some personality I don't have. Sometime I felt sad. Ling who always encourage me all the time. Ling who always care about me and my felling. I'm so glad I have this friend with me. I can't image I don't have her in my life. Even thought we don't have similar personality that we still can be best friends. Ling who have different personality with me but we can cover each other. Now we are in different country. We still connect with each other. Ling who always encourage me even thought We don't stay with each other.
