A lot of people live in the world. Everybody is different than other. We have a lot of different life style. Some of people are work all week although some people can work just weekdays. In addition some people can go to a bar or dinner just Friday nights but some people do not. They want to be relaxed on Friday nights. What do I do on Fridays and Sundays In Turkey I had a regular life so usually I did same thing every single Friday and Sunday. One obvious difference is spending a time. When I was a turkey I studied master. Every Fridays I studied until 6pm. And then I went to home and I changed my cloths. Approximately my friends and I met 7 30 every single Friday. We said happy hours for this limited time. We hanged out drink something and ate dinner. Sometimes we went to bar sometimes we went to restaurant but we must went to outside on Fridays night. My friends were working so they were really tired end of the week and they wanted to be relaxed. If I have to say something for Sundays it was so different. Usually I didn't go to outside Sunday nights because I had to prepare something for on Monday morning. I stayed at home I spent a time with my family on Sunday nights. The other difference is wake up time and breakfast style. I woke up 6 30 am every Friday mornings but on Sunday usually I woke up 10am. My breakfast style was so different Sundays and Fridays. I ate cereal every Friday mornings. Obviously I ate cereal except weekend because it was fast and ready breakfast. On Sundays I made a cr sion everyday is different than others. Usually on Fridays all day I worked or studied just Friday night I went to somewhere. Also I studied on Sundays too but I felt relaxed than weekdays. Sundays and Fridays woke time and breakfast styles were very different. If I wanted to do something I had to do on Friday because I didn't have a time on Sundays.
