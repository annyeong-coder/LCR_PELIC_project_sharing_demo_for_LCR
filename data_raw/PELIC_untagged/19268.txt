I meet my husband Two and half years ago. We both worked at the same engineering company. On the first month I didn't noticed him because I was a new employee and I was shy so I had never left my spot. After five months we became friends and did a lot of successful projects together. Four months later he proposed to me and while we were engaged we planned our educational future. A year later we got married And Now we are having advanture together of being broad of our country and studying to achieve our goal.
