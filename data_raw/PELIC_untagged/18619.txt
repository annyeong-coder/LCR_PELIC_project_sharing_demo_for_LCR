In the first year of my job The company sent me with other three colleagues to Madrid Spain for 3 weeks training courses. We were busy all days taking classes except the weekend. On the weekend we ought to have visited some places but we stayed at the hotel. When I asked my colleagues to go out they refuse and convince me to stay. I knew they were older than me and they had experience in such occasion but I shouldn't have listened to them and I could have gone alone. At least I might have gone to the stadium to watch a soccer match for Real Madrid which I support. It wasn't a good trip but I learned a lot from it.
