Dear Moh How are you I hope you are doing well. I am writing this letter to let you know about one of my hobbies that has made my English better. That hobby is reading stories. Since I was an undergraduate student I have read ficton stories. In fact Reading enriched my vocabulary. I have read 4 stories since I came to The USA. I have been looking for a story called the merchant of gun so can you please help me find that story As I heard this story has been read by different categories of people since it was published. Any way I have been working on reading homework given by our teacher for two days. I am looking forward to hearing from you ASAP. Best wishes ANON_NAME_0 ALNASSER
