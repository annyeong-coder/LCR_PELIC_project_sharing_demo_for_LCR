I usually study at the library. That building has 4 floors. On the second floor there are several rooms. The study room is one of them. If you enter the study room you can see many desks and chairs. Each desks have desk lights. Some of desks have computers which you can use if you have a library card. In the middle of the room there is a clark some librarian work for us. That room has a high ceiling and ceiling is painted like heaven. Every side of the wall there are book cases. But it is not so tall. The other side of the fallway there is some big windows above the book cases. Every side of the wall there are door ways. These door ways connected to another rooms. I think the library is a good place to study.
