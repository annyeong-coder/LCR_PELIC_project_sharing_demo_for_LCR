When I was a third grade student in the university I started to consider what I wanted to do in future then I decided to apply for graduate school and continue studying. In Taiwan the process of applying graduate school is different between in the U. S. Students are able to apply for the graduate program with their grades which they have got in undergraduate school or take through examinations which are hold by each university. . I have to say that I really was not a study hard student therefore I chose taking the examination. I had prepared for 4 months before I took the examination. And I realize that I was not interested in the field which I had studied then I gave up. In a random situation on of my relative who is an American citizen offered me to come to the U. S that I had never thought. I came to the U. S I enrolled in the ELI I have experienced a lot until now. All of my life is what I have never imaged!
