Although I like small towns there are many disadvantages of growing up there. First of all there aren't famous and great institutions. In fact there aren't Universities and Hospitals so people have to go to the closest big city to study or to have a good Health care. Not only all that is not handy but also it is too expensive. Besides there are few entertainments such as theaters libraries etc. Second in a small town there are worse job opportunities not only because there aren't big firms but also because there is less possibility to meet well introduced people in that field. Finally the majority of the people of a small town have not an open mind. It is shown both towards foreigners because they are afraid of individuals with different cultures from their own and by gossip because people know everything about everybody. In conclusion even if I like small towns I would not want my children to grow up there because there aren't important institutions very good jobs and enough privacy.
