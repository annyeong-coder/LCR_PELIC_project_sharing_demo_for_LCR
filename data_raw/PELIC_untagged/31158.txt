Gwangeun Jang 10 29 2011 Euthanasia should be legalized As a human being we have a strong right to choose our lives. That is a basic natural privilege for human. So I am going to talk about the most controversial issue 'Euthanasia. ' If you had to choose between a death of torture and a peace of ease wouldn't you rather select the more pleasant death Shouldn't you be entitled to picking your own death That is what living in a democratic society is all about. Whether or not euthanasia should be legalized this subject has been the debating totic recently. In Switzerland it is already legal. In spite of this fact all the majority of the world it still remains illegal. In my opinion Euthanasia should be legalized for some reasons. First the word 'Euthanasia' literally means good because it originally came from the ancient Greek which means good death . It essentially means mercy killing or killing someone who does not any longer want to live. This term can also refer to putting an animal to 'sleep' although in this usage it more often means the killing of someone who it is not economically desirable to save. Second people shoud get the righit to choose their own lives.
