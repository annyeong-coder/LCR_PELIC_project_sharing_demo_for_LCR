However tables and chairs have to be arranged in the celebtration place and you can put some stuff like balloons on the ceiling and decoration on the wall. Secondly if the celebration is important like wedding inviting the guests will be difficult. You may asq help from some friends to invite especially if they are new friends and from different cultures. At the same time some friends can buy food while you are preparing your party. The main benefit from these parties is to have a good time and it is an oppotunity to meet new friends.
