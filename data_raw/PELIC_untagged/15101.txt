I met my best friend Heather while I was studying high school in Taiwan. We have met since 1997. When we were students we were going shopping and studying in library after school. We spent our whole time together. Moreover she is my sister because she takes caring me all the time. Before I had any problems she always helped me a lot. However she moved to Australia in 2003 for studying and we are still keeping in touch.
