Before I left Pittsburgh to Atlanta the hometown of Coca Cola happiness was foreseeable because my whole family joined the trip with me. We acknowledged the history of Civil War when we were in the Atlanta History Center surfed in the world of colorful fish in the Georgia Aquarium tasted Southern food at the famous Mary Mac's Tea House revealed the veil of broadcasting in CNN. We thrived on the busy schedule and had an unqualified safe trip. I aspire to travel Atlanta again in the future.
