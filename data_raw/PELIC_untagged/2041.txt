Marriages have been changing. They are much different between nowadays and grandparents' age especially the dating. Now people can date others while a long time ago dating was prohibited in Chinese culture. In other words it seldom happened before. In the modern society people are so lucky because they can date their lovers in public places. If the couple decides to marry they just go to the court and register. That's all. In my grandparents' age and before it was impossible. Women who were not married could not stay in public places. They could only stay at home and could not be seen by strangers even the visitors. When a man wanted to marry or the man's parents thought he should have a wife they would hire a matchmaker who was a female. Then the matchmaker would found some appropriate girls to let the man's family to choose one of them based on the girl's conditions such as the economic condition of the family and the quality of the girl. After picking up one the matchmaker started to negotiate with the girl's family. If the girl's family permitted the match the man should send a lot of gifts to the girl's home and told the girl when the wedding part would take place. Until the wedding part the couple had never seen each other. After getting married the couple just started to get acquainted with each other and learned how to treat each other. If a girl was lucky to marry with a good guy she would have a nice future. If not her whole life would have a big change because in the past women had no right to divorce from her husband. Only men had it.
