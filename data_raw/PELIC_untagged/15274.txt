The driver's behavior in Pittsburgh are sometimes bad. I had several situations which other drivers made me afraid. One of them was I stand in front of a red traffic light and I wanted to turn left. In this moment someone started to honk behind me. Another uncomfortable situation was I was just arrived in Pittsburgh and I had to drove by car on my first time in America. I went with a GPS System. This told me that I was supposed to take the next exit in two miles. I thought that I could change the lane from the middle to the right. Unfortunately this change was to early and I wanted to go back to the other lane. I turn the signal to go left but nobody let me on this lane. For that I had to make a big detour because I had to take the incorrect exit. The most scary situation was it was a really bad weather condition the road was covered with a great deal of snow and I drove with around 35 mph. All other drivers were not be careful and passed me wither over 50 mph. I was not aware that some driver's behavior is really careless and awful in Pittsburgh.
