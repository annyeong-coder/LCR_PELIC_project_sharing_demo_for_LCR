I approve school to limit student's time on line. Because it help students wean from their computer habits let them go outside hang out with people and help they enjoy their human's life. Using computer is very convenient but only sit down front computer is not good for health and make relationship with people also can feel the real life. Students need to participate in activities for enjoying their university life. In university students have a lot of chances to meet people from different place. Everyone own their thinking or major. Students due to meet new people to learn new thinking or add their widen. Only use computer whole day waste their time so much. So limiting student's time on line is a good idea to help students using computer too much. Some students addicted to computer because their personal problems such as low self esteem bad communication with family or friends. Using computer to escape from the problems is not a good method to solve the problems. To face the problems and try to solve them is the best way. University students usually have time to do anything they want to do also they are young. They can use their best time to challenge new things. It is better to only sit down front computer.
