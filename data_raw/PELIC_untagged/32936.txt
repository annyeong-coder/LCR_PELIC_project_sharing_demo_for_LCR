This happened in my high school life. One day morning I woke up at 8 00 but still stayed in bed. Then the phone rang. I got up and picked up the phone. Hello is Jiayi Dong here a gentle voice said. I knew the voice. It must be the seller from the book store! She has phoned me a lot of times and wanted to talk me into buying a membership card. I was so angry because it was weekend and I enjoyed staying in bed. Do you know how to respect others Stop bothering me! I said loudly. The other side stopped talking I knew she was surprised. Then I just hung it up. After 30 minutes my friend text me have you received the phone from counselor She called us to inform that we should wear school uniform on Monday. Suddenly I got something and I thought I should call my counselor back right now.
