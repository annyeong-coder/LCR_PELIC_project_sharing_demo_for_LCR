I like to do many things in my leisure time. I enjoy going shopping with friends. I am always looking for the shoes first. I like to collect shoes my mother is always telling me Stop buying new shoes again! But I can not. Now even though I come to the U. S. I am still buying new shoes. Also I often go to see a movie with my sister in weekend. I like to see a movie especially the action movie. The action movie lets me feel excited and see a movie also can help me training my listening. One more activity that I like the most is play puzzles. I am always playing puzzles which are over 1000 pieces. Playing the puzzle likes overcome a challenge. Every time after I finish the puzzle let me feel a sense of achievement.
