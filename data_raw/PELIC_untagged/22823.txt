I thought over to find my room in the U. S. Because I had no opportunity living in the U. S. I didn't know which one was the best room in the U. S. My Korean friend who is living in the U. S. Recommended me this apartment. When I saw this apartment first this was so messy. It was needed to straighten up. I had tried out that tap water heating and electricity worked well. It had been fine. So I filled out a contract and signed up for the rental apartment. I started to straighten up my room. I vacuumed in the room picked garbage up and threw them away. I bought a bed and a rocking chair from IKEA. My Korean friend helped me to carry them in his car. He and I put them into his car. He drove his car. We arrived at the apartment. We put down them in front of the apartment door. We moved them to an elevator and took it. We felt difficult to put them down in the room because of their size and weight. I talked over with him how to decorate my room. I put up a framed picture and the national flag of South Korea on the wall. I put roses in a vase. The room was filled with the fragrance of roses. I hung curtains on a window. I took great pains to decorate the room. Eventually my room was clean and had a comfortable.
