Being a student is accepted as one of the most important reasons restricting freedoms. Does it really set a limit to freedoms or does it enable students to be educated Actually there are pressures of being a student that the tuition fee may not be affordable students have to do homework society expects very high degree and success and family especially parents can restrict social activities. Therefore being a student means a very strict life. First of all tuition fees are too expensive so that many students can not pay. For example some universities in the US demand over 50. 000 A year tuition fee which some students who earn below 50. 000 Can not afford it. Hence tuition fee is one of the most restrictive parts of studentship. Additionally because students have to do homework they are under pressure. Being a student requires them to do homework instead of participating in other activities such as playing games watching tv and meeting friends. In other words students have to start to do homework once they arrive at their home. On the other hand teachers may force students to do homework. Thus teachers can set a limit to their personality. Students who are confronted with a threat of low points are obliged to do homework. Finally society forces students to be successful. Besides family especially parents can restrict student's social activities in order that they do their homework and study their lessons. To prohibit going to the cinema meeting with friends and playing games is a big example. All of these reasons can cause that students unwillingly study their lessons and do their homework. In conclusion whether tuition fee is not affordable or students have to study their lessons or parents set a limit to their social activities being a student means being under pressure and restricting individual freedom.
