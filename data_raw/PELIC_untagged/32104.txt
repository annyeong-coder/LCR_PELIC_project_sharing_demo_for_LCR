Shopping online is useful these days. Many people choose buying online instead of buying from stores. I agree with the author when he said that the shopping online is bad for the environment. Because it is wasteful. When people shopping online they waste more materials from plastic and paper. And these products needs to packed in a lot of materials. Especially when people buy large and heavy products. For my opinion I usually don't buy from the internet. I like to see and touch everything before I buy it. So even if online shopping is fast and easy I think it is bad for the environment
