Compare My Hometown and Pittsburgh. I used to live in my city Misurata before I come here last year. As I was living there I thought it is the best place to live in. My thinking has been changing after I saw Pittsburgh. Misurata and Pittsburgh are similar in many things. For example my city is as small as Pittsburgh and they are both beautiful and clean. On the other hand there are many differences in many things between the two cities such as the weather people and transportation. First the weather in my city is completely different from the weather in Pittsburgh. In my hometown we were suffering from hot weather all year. Some years even the winter is hot during the days. Some days you cannot drive your car without open the air condition. However I have never watched the snow before my first time was last year here in Pittsburgh. Although I liked the snow and cold weather I missed the weather of my city. Second Pittsburgh's people are less helpful then people in my city. For example in Misurata city when a stranger asks someone about an address he do not know it the citizen will take him to the address by his car. But here the Americans people did not do that even with another American. While I am living in Pittsburgh my car broke down in the middle of street two months ago no body helped me. But in my city if this thing happened with someone all the people will help him. Third during my living here I found very nice transportation. It finds everywhere and works till after midnight every day. Because of my city does not have public transportation after 5. 00 PM and buses do not have a stable schedule like the buses here you have to have a car if you want to live there. Finally because of these reasons I would like to live in Pittsburgh forever. So I hope to complete my Study and get a job here in Pittsburgh.
