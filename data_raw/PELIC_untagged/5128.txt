I learned a lot form studying the past . I learned that people sometimes makes mistakes and those mistakes lead to unfavourable outcomes. These mistakes were usually due to errors in judgement or lack of preparation. In order for one to make more informed decisions one must analyze prepare before they take action. When I was a boy I crossed the street without looking and was struck by a car. Now I suffer from a pain in my leg. If I would have looked before I crossed the street I would have seen the car and it would not have hit me. The pain in my leg is a constant remainder of my poor judgment on that day.
