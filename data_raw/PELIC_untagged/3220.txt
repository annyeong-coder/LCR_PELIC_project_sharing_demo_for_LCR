When I was a child I lived in Asuncion which is a capital city in Paraguay. I went to an elementary school that other japanese students went to. This school has a lot of trees and I have a favorite tree called Borracho. It was a very big tree and the meaning of Borracho is a big man who is drinking. There were also a lot of hibiscus which is a flower in southern country and we can see red white orange and pink hibiscus. In summer students always went to a pool which was in school and played each other. After playing in the pool we usually eat asado which is a kind of BBQ in south america. We always went to school on every weekend. A number of all students was only twenty so we knew each other well and played a lot. Paraguay is a country where I really like and I learned a lot of things.
