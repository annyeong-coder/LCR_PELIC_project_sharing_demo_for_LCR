When I go into my room at home I can see my piano which is against the right side of the wall. On the left corner of my room there is my bed that I used to chat with my sister everynight. There is also my desk where I used to do my homework. I also have a computer in which desk is. Near the bed I have my stereo which I used to listen to music all the time. My sister's closet is in my room too. It is placed next to the piano. My sister whose closet is in my room used to come in to my room all the time in order to change her clothes.
