What I am surprised and shocked here are misunderstanding of Japanese and food. In the beginning of my life in Pittsburgh I met many people who are studying Japanese at Pitt. The fact that most of the students love anime was surprising me. What I was shocked was they think most Japanese love anime. In fact I barely saw people who love anime as much as they do when I was in Japan. Moreover what they think that Japanese know everything about Japanese anime was also shocking. On the other hand the menu and potion of food in the U. S. Were surprising me. I cannot believe that vegetables are more expensive than sandwiches and burgers. One potion of food is twice more than Japanese. The most shocking fact is that I am getting to used to the potion size lately.
