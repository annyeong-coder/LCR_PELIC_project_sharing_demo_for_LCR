The kitchen in my house. There is a yellow inhibition around the room. When came to the house I smelled the food who my mother cooked. Every day I hear my mother yelling to my sister because she didn't help her . In the corner it was the stove I never stayed near it because it's made me I felt hot and I sweat. There is a window I can see the beautiful back yard from it . There are trees and flours. When the sun light come inside the kitchen it make the room wonderful. This the wonderful place in my house I like it
