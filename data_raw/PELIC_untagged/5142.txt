I grew up in Seoul Korea. I've been living in Pittsburgh since 2006. I've been studying English in the ELI. Since I met my Japanese friend I've been interested in learn languages other country's languages . And other country's cultures. So I've learned Japanese and Chinese culture and I've read a book about another country. In fact last year I visited Japan. I am going to visit another country maybe next year.
