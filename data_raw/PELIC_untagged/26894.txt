Hi I am ANON_NAME_0 from Saudi Arabia. I was born in Riyadh the capital city in Saudi Arabia and I grew up there. Now I am living in the US and I've been here since January 2010. Last month I thought about building a blog website to talk about my beautiful memories here. So far I've been working on my blog and I've posted a lot of stories about my life in the US. Lately I've been studying English and I will get a TOEFL score for my academic admission. In May 2010 I joined ELI at the University of Pittsburgh to study English. Since then I've taken five classes and I've met a lot of friendly people. I changed my hobby which used to be soccer but since I moved to Pittsburgh I've learned how to ice skiing. Last winter season I've already gone 7 times. In addition a friend of mine taught me how to play Racquetball. Since then I've been playing Racquetball and I've signed up to a competition. I don't have a social life because I'm single but since Six months I met a beautiful girl. So far we've gone through interesting progress in our relationship. Lately I've been working in developing my blog and I've written a lot stories. Check them out soon.
