Two years ago I saw an accident. While I was pulling up the kerb with my friend A man was walking thoughtful infront of us He was very abstracted. Suddenly he decided to across the road but there wasn't green light to across the road and A man was driving very fast. When The driver saw him it was very late for him. The car hit him. People crowded around to him. He was lying on the road. His head was bleeding. An ambulance came and carried him to a hospital. Every people must be accurate and comply with the rules.
