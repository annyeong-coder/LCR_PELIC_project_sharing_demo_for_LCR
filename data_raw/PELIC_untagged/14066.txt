When I was in middle school my teacher gave me an assignment which was making a water rocket. There were big winning prizes. By the way some company made a water rocket kit. So every student just bought that kit and made same water rocket. It was supposed to make them with plastic bottle and some recycling stuff. I think this winning prize make them like that.
