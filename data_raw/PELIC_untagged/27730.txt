I grew up at this apartment. My parents moved out since I was 18 years old. Every Saturday I ask my parents over to get dinner with me. I usually sit down in the garden because I like the view. Everyday I look after my plants. I always straighten up my room. Recently I moved my bed around because I like to have a new organization every three months. I love to write what I need down weekly to be organized. I didn't pick out the furniture of my sisters room my mother did. So she's planning to throw her furniture away. However she wants to pick a new furniture up to her room. Before sleeping we always turn off the lights and the T. V. Finally I'm sure I won't give up those habits.
