My favorite place to eat lunch in Oakland is Taiwan Cafe. There s many reasons that I always go there eat in the lunch. First Taiwan cafe s boss is from Taiwan which is the same country with me. I can speak Chinese with them that make me feel like coming back my country and take a break. Also they play our country s song make me feel very good during lunch time. Second I get used to my home country s food than American food . The food is very delicious . I took my friend s to there most of them like their food . The most important thing is it s very cheap. It s only cost five six dollars during the lunch time and their food is very big. Every time when I have lunch there I feel satisfied and full. The last but not the least they sell bubbles milk tea there which is my favorite food in Taiwan. I drink it all the time when I have lunch. That s a important thing that why I like Taiwan Caf
