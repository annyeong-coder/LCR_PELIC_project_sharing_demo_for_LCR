In our lifes there are a lot of things are very important and these are depend on the person. However when I want to express my idea I have to said there are 3 most important things in life. First religion because the did create us for fun or work. He created us to worship him and thanks him for every thing which he gives us. Second family when you have a good family around you you are rich person because the money is not every thing. We have to have realtionships with people around us especially our family to find them when you need help. If someone doesn't have family and he dies there is no body care about him or feel bad about him because no body feels you and miss like your family especially your wife and your mother. Finally work. It's important because we have to work to improve our skills and to show ourselfs and people what and how can we do to give ourselfs the trust and to be stronger in the life. These three things make a tringle of the imortant things in our life and we must to beleive in god and to be good members in our families and work hard and do our best.
