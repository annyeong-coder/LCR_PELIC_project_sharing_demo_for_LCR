Dear 'fed up with dog poop' I understand your feelings. I think you are angry. If so you should talk to your new neighbor. It is important that for you to understand each other. You should talk to her about her about her dog poop. Otherwise you would get depressed. Because it made you were very sad for a long time. Once you can't control your emotion you will go to argue with her. If so your nice relationship will be broken completely. On the other hand maybe she never cares about her dog keeps pooping in your yard. She thinks you also don't care about her dog poops. She doesn't know your feelings. I suggest that you tell her your true feelings. With a nice communication you would tell her your opinion. If so that would solve your problem. If not that would misunderstand for a long time. If I were you I would have told her my feelings at the beginning. It is time that you tell her your feelings. Do you have any question If so please write and let me know! Regards Manners
