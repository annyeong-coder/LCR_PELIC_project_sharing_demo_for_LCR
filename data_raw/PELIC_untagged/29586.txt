The Green Miles was one of the most beautiful movies that I saw during my life. The movie occurred in a jail. There were four policemen in the jail all of whom had good characteristics except one. Also there were some murders in the jail one of whom was arrested by mistake. The man arrested by mistake was a black guy having a special power to cure all kinds of diseases. He could also make dead specious alive. One of the policemen had urinary problem and the black man cured him. Furthermore the policeman who was a bad guy and jealous to others killed a mouse belonging to another murder in the jail. Therefore the black man made the mouse alive again with his special power. The species gotten help from the black man will live for a long time. Finally we realized that the policeman who had urinary problem was telling the story and also he was taking care of the mouse.
