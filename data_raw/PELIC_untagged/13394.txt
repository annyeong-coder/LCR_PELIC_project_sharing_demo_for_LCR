There is a famous restaurant named T. G. I. F in Taiwan which I am sure there are many T. G. I. F restaurants in U. S. A I had the worst meal I have ever had there. When I was a freshman in university one of my friends introduced her male friends to me there. It was a really hot summer day and I was very thirsty before I came there. Therefore we ordered something to drink first my friend ordered the drink for me. I thought that was soda but the drink was an alcoholic soft drink and I drank one breath. Actually I am bad at drinking. After ten minutes I went to restroom throw up and I felt very embarrassed at that time. Although I did not eat a lot dishes I still need to share the bill with them who ordered many dishes which I can't eat I am vegetarian . I think that is the worst meal I have ever had.
