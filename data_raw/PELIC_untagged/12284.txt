Hi I am Yonggu ANON_NAME_0. I've written some paragraphs about myself. I've been living in Pittsburgh since 2007. I'm researching personalized information retrieval in the School of Information Sciences University of Pittsburgh. This topic uses computer systems and computer programming. I like computer. I've used computer since I entered university. Some people say that learning computer is very difficult but I have been studying computer by myself. In the initial stages when I studied computer programming I had been playing computer games. While I was playing computer games I was sometimes thinking how game developer had made it. This behavior is important for me to study computer programming. Although I can't develop computer games I can program computers to research my topic.
