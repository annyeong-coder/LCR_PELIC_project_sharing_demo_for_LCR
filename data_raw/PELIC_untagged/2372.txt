When I was 7 years olds I moved to next a town. I couldn't adapt myself to new circumstances environment . I was playing alone when I met her first time . She was older than me she was beautiful and attractive. I liked her. We studied at her home together often and we ate lunch everyday. I got many experiences and courage by her. After she moved to country I couldn't meet her anymore.
