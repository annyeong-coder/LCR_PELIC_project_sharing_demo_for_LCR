I often expected that I could go abroad to study or live for a few days when I was a student at university in Taiwan. After I retired from military service I had a chance to achieve my wish. At that time I had not found my job and I had a lot of free time. At the same time My cousin who had studied in America encouraged me to go to America. He said I could live in his home when I came to America. I was very glad to hear what he told me. In October last year I told my father I decided to go to America and I would study at university of Pittsburgh. I was afraid my father would turn me down. Finally my father accept to let me come to America. Now I have lived in Pittsburgh for two month and I believe these days will become one of my specially experience.
