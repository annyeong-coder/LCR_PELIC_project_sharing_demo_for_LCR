I should take a box of matches a pen and paper knife toothbrush and a book. I have to have matches with me in order to start a fire cook my food keep me warm at night and also to see at night. I must have with me a pen and paper so that I can write down my activties and leave behind my life history for someone to read. I should have a knife to hunt for food. I must have a toothbrush because I need to take care of my teeth. Finally I must have a book to occupy myself and pass the time.
