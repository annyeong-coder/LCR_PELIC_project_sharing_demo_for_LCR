Actually I would like to talk about one of my teachers who thought me in the MSc program and he was my thesis supervisor he was Egyption Professor graduated from the US and he do makes me learn more knowledge about my field and he helped me learn the methods of research. Moreover he helped me write the thesis in perfect way and he donot have me feel sad or hopeless. This professor helped me do the presentation with more confidence and from time to time he let me make mistakes in order to learn. Also he said all of us learn from our mistakes and he got me to add more information to be a good University teacher.
