In the weekend I traveled to New Yourk city. When I arrived to New Yourk city I go to restaurant. I lived in hotel. Next day I went to library. After that I watched the movie. After the movie I ate noodles and I drank water. I slept at 11 00 P. M. I wok up at 9 00A. M. I wrote some words for my father. I saw the some beautiful skyscraper in New Yourk city. I like this city.
