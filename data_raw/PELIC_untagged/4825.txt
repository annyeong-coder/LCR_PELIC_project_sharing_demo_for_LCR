The women have many important roles in the past and now. In the past women served main role of bear babies and keep the house clean and cook. Also they almost were not got good education by some tradional ethics or religouse rules. But today they roles increased and became very wide. They study at all field of human society have opprtunities for going to careers and they can participate in the activities at high desicion making level. Today economy developed technology improved and household tasks were simplified and they have more time to get education. In the other hand parents think that they might face difficultties without any good education. Now in the developed countries women have good ducation more that men. Beginning of XX women began to work outside of their home as a teachers and a doctors etc. Also they worked many defferent industrial factories. From this time women's participation to job career increased quickly and now women are working in all kind of work from an any part time works to a high level desicion makers. For example now State Secretary of USA is Candoliza Rize who is a woman. They are good peacekeepers. Some people mean as well as the men could participate in public activities. That is not true. Women have main role in public activities such us pilantropi or organization of nature protect projects. Becuase they can predict every little influences that might be faced difficulties and can organize by negotiation. In the conclusion the women's role is going to increase in the future. They will bore and will grow child and will particpate social life. And I have no doubt women responsibilities will get much more than men. In the future no required any men.
