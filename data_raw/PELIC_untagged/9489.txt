Hi. My name is Kevin Last Name . I am from Taiwan. Actually my Taiwanese friends always called me stop . Because my name sounds like stop in Chinese. Also because I speak Chinese so maybe you will think whether Taiwan and China is same. Of cause not we are different governments. Also some of the Taiwanese can speak two languages Chinese and Taiwanese I can speak both. Now I am living in Pittsburgh so I hope before I go back Taiwan I can speak three languages. Also I like to listen music in my free time. I like Rock music. I used to play in the school band. I really enjoyed playing music with my friends. Then after this semester I am going to go back taiwan. I want to study university in taiwan because I grew up in taiwan I like taiwan better. I also want to have a band while I am studying in university.
