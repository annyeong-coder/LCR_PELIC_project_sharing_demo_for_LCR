When I was in the Arizona last semester I went to Losangeles and Sandi ego CA on vacation. We were four people all they were my classmates. Before we went there we met at my Apartment to make a plan. We decided to rent a car we will go to Losangeles exactly to Universal Studio and Disneyland and then we will go to Sandi ego World Sea. When we were there we did many things. First we stayed at a beautiful hotel. Its name is Garden. We took two Quinn beds and two bathrooms. We did not do any thing just every body went to sleep early because we spent eight hours from Arizona to there. Second day we got up early and went to Universal Studio the surprise was we decided to spent a few hours there not more than noon and then we had to go to other place like Hollywood but we spent all the day there we couldn't believe that It was wonderful. Every one bought many things for me I bought some clothes but the most expensive thing I bought was Oscar bag it was a present for my girlfriend. Third we went to restaurant at the market for lunch. We bought some fries bread and cheese and of course harissa spicy flavor. Forth we . Etc
