First Koreans do rituals for their ancestors and eat special foods. Then they play traditional games. In the morning of 'Seol' Koreans meet their relatives and perforn rituals for their ancestors. People go to their grandfather's or the eldest brother's house. After some foods which they prepared previously are arrayed people bow and pour liquor into a porcelain cup. And they visit the graves of ancestors and tidy up weeds. This ritual has value to show respect for the ancestors. After the ritual traditional food 'Ddeok guk' is made and eaten by Koreans. This is a kind of soup with rice cake. Generally most of the people eat it at a late breakfast or lunch but it can be eaten anytime in 'Seol'. And sometimes it is served to visitors. Koreans think that sharing foods can be like sharing happiness so they enjoy eating foods together. In the afternoon of 'Seol' traditional games are played. Especially 'Neol ddui gi' is most famous and popular among people of all ages. Women enjoy this game more than men do but men also can play it. 'Neol ddui gi' is similar to seesaw. However the difference is that players have to keep standing on the board while they are playing. And this is not a competition just for fun.

However people spend time with family and pray that the new year will be a happy and comfortable year. These are the reasons why 'Seol' is the representative holiday in Korea.
