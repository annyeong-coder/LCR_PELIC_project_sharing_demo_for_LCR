Once a U. S philosoppher Ralp Barton Perry said that Wherever you are it is your own friends who make your world. I very much agree with this philosopher. A friend is someone who makes my life enjoyable. I have a friend who is this way too. Her name is Nagihan. Wherever I was not happy it was Nagihan who made me feel better. Nagihan is my friend who graduated from same high school with me. When we were in high school I had a big problem that was bring me down. One day I really got a bad grade that caused me not to pass my class. I didnot know who to talk to. The test was so hard that everbody failed. Nagihan came up to me and asked how I was feeling. I told her everything she was very caring. I think she has personality which is the number one in the world. After she cheered me up at the end of day I was no longer feeling bad. I always thank Nagihan for being there for me. Since I have came here I keep writing to her letters which are always exciting. I missed her which is very emotional fellings.
