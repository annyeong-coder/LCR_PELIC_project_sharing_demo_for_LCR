What I like in Pittsburgh is the transportation system that is provided by many facilities specially for elderly and disabled people. Another thing that I fascinated with is the diversity of cultures that gathered in Pittsburgh which gave her special characteristics. One more thing attracts my attention is how hospitals are well organized and supplemented by many equipment. What I don't like about Pittsburgh is the use of very large cups in restaurants. The smallest one is double size what we use in my country. What annoys me the most in Pittsburgh is when a pregnant woman keeps smoking. I am surprised by the fact that many of hospital's employees are smokers. I thought when people are well educated they tend to protect their health.
