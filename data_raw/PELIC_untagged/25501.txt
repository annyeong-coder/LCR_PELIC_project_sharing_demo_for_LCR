What is happiness When do people think they are happy We can see frequently that somebody is unhappy after he she quits working. Some research shows married person lives a healthier life than single person. Human beings are social animal. That is why we have to live in many relationships. When people have their role in life they can feel happiness. In my case I have three roles that make me happy as a daughter a wife and a nurse. The main thing that makes me happy is being a daughter . I have two parents including parents in law. Now I am taking care of the parents especially regarding to health. I made them receive a health examination every year. I encouraged them and made a reservation and sometimes pay for them. If they need advices related to health they ask to me. The next thing that makes me happy is being a wife. I am happy when I make delicious meals for my husband. Traveling with my husband who I love is also happy. Last winter I went to Lake Erie with my husband and it was so good that I could refresh myself. Without my husband I could not have such a good time even though the lake was spectacle. The final thing that makes me happy is being a nurse. The thing I can help somebody sick makes me happy. There are many occupations but it is rare which can help people. Help people as well as make money. What a good occupation it is! Also I can learn many things during working. To summarize being a daughter being a wife and being a nurse make me happy. Even though roles above make me happy fundamentally it is important that happiness is deeply related to how we feel.
