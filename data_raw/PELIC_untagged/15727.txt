Food in United States is not as fresh as in Saudi Arabia. Most of their food is frozen or half cooked. Although it has a lot of farms which plant many kinds of vegetables and fruits and such as corn potato and orange however American food is less healthy greasier and saltier than Saudi's food. In fact Saudi's food based on wheat rice meat chicken and dates for sweet and it is testier than the American's food. It is less fat and more nutritive. I know I was harsh on the American food but that is my point of view.
