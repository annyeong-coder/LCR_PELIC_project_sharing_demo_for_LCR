When I came to the Pittsburgh I rent a cell phone. I read the manual. Of course it was written by English. I gave up to read them after reading a few ANON_NAME_0. I couldn't figure out how to use it. Absolutely I could pick up and hang up it. But that's it. After a few days it displayed new voice message . I went over the manual and found out how to play the message. Finally I could call him back. Recently I can read English a little. I can turn volume down. I can set alarm to wake up. Maybe I will go on reading the manual for something new happened. I keep on studying English for future reference. But I end up returning the phone when I come back to Japan.
