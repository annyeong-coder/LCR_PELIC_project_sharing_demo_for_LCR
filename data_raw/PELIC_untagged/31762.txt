I came to the united states to join a gradute school and to complete my higher education. I am now looking for an acceptance in G. S. I think I should not have come here without an acceptance. I could have gotten one before I came here. But I did not try to get one. I blame my sponser because he ought to have helped me and other students who are in the same satuation. But they said we can't. I must have studied hard to get a high score in TOEFL before I came here.
