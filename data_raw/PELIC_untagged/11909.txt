Unit 9 Ex. 9 When I came to the United States for the first time alone 2 years ago I had a not so interesting experience. I flew from Taiwan to Japan then from Japan to the USA. I arrived in the Detroit airport. I was very excited to be in the US but something went wrong! A customs official did not let me pass the gate but told me to go to a waiting room for questions. I thought I was in trouble and could not enter the US! The customs official first asked many times why I had two very large and heavy bags and many things in them. I told him I really needed so many things. Some things were also pricey so he asked me if I was selling those things to make a lot of money. He also found 1700 US cash on me. It was given to me by my father before I came to the US. I only wrote down 700 because I didn't know my father gave me so much money. The customs official thought I was lying and I was going to use the money to do bad things in the US. During this time I was so nervous and I even cried because he was giving me a hard time. My English was also very poor so he confused me with his questions many times. Finally after almost 1. 5 Hours he believed me and let me go but I missed my Pittsburgh flight. This was such a bad experience for me but I am glad I am studying in the US now.
