My brother introduced my husband to me in 2004. When I met my husband for the fist time he looked calm and so cool. We talked very much about each other and enjoyed our first date. I think he looked so excited and happy. He was smiling during our conversation. After first date we met almost every day. We saw many movies and talked very much in our dates. While dating with him I felt comfortable and easy of mind. However he should leave Korea within several months because he should go to Pittsburgh for his research study. He was reluctant to leave me. So we went to trip for our farewell travel in Pusan. When we arrived in Pusan he proposed marriage to me with a beautiful ring. I fell in love with him and we married in 2005. I came to Pittsburgh with him in 2005.
