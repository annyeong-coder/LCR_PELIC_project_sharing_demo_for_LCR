Personal Letter October 20 2006 Dear Ben How are you I'll buy a camera for my daughter and son. I have been saw a camera of two different brand but they have different a function and price. I want your thoughts. First there are differences between the Olympus Camera one and the Sonny Camera one name. Next the Olympus camera one has several options. For example it has 5. 0 Mega pixel 4 digital zoom 3 optical but the Sony camera one has 4. 1 Mega pixel. Finally the Olympus camera is price is 269. 88. But The Sony camera is 199. 99. The Olympus camera is more expensive than the Sony camera. I prefer the Olympus camera so I will buy an Olympus camera because the Olympus camera has more options than the Sony camera. Sincerely P S See you soon
