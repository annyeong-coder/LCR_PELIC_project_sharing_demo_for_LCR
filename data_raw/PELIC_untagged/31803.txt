Babies should sleep with their parents if they desire it. Sut few weeks. After that they should stay in the mother's bed until they are three or even four years old. ANON_URLSPAGE_In some cases because of parents busy schedule poor children lack of communication with their parents and co sleeping could be fine alternative. This issue has another side when parents also need to feel proximity with their children. I m actually experiencing it now it s hard to spend very limited time with my son. And when he wants to lay down with me on my bed I can t refuse in this little request and enjoy this time with him too. S ome parents do not want to share the bed with babies and it makes sense in certain cases. Of course if a baby can sleep independently it is easier for parents and sometimes even for the baby. But if babies really have a need in co sleeping parents should not restrict them because babies feel loneliness sadness and nervousness which possibly could cause health problems in the future. To sum this I recommend don t hear other people listen yourself. If you think it s better for your child to share your bed just do it.
