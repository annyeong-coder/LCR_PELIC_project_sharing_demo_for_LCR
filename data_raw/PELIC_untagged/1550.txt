According to The Disappearance Philip Wiley believes that men and women shouldn't live in separate worlds because men are too aggressive and women are too helpless. I agree that men and women shouldn't live in separate worlds but I don't agree with his argument because his argument is not reasonable. If men and women lived in different societies they couldn't learn the difference and do some activities. I think if the world has only men or women people wouldn't know the difference between men and women. Men and women have many different things such as living behavior appearance look sex. Some activities or jobs are suitable for men and some is suitable for women. Building construction for example if men in the world disappeared building wouldn't be constructed or use for a long time for constructing. On the other hand if women in the world went to another world human would extinct because they don't have anyone who gives a birth.
