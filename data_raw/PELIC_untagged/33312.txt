Before I transferred to the ELI program I had been studying in the ESL program for a year and half. It was an amazing experience for me as I learned many new things there. While I was a student there I had been learning English language for five semesters. Also I had been working hard there to improve my second language. So by the time I finished their program I had improved my ability to use this language which had helped me to communicate with people easily. This experience had changed my opinion of living and studying abroad because they had taught us how to engage ourselves in the American culture as the American students do which I had not expected to be that easy. Their approaching of teaching was very interesting and useful because we had practiced different ways of learning English as a second language. In addition to the processes of their teaching that I had there I had gotten the opportunity to meet many American students in the classes and even out of the classes which I had never done before I studied there. I really loved this experiences and its amazing result.
