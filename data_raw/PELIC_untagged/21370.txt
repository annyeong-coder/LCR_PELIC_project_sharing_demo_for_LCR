As most of you know that I am a medicaal student and it is crucial for me to study English as it is the international language of medicine. My excellent grade was the triger for me to persue my medical post graduate studies in the USA. When I came to the US I got the acess to one of the best english schools for the forigners the ELI. My secess as a fluent english speaker is attributed to the efforts of ELI teachers. The ELI fremework of study is wonderful. I got the chance to speak with a diverse nationalities from all over the world. My english profeciency was transformed from low intermediate to advanced level after I attented the ELI. In addition I will persist to implement what I have learend from the ELI in my accademic carrer.
