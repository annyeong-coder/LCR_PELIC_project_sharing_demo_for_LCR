At first I came to the United States for vacation. Once it was a time to go home I felt I wanted to improve my English. I was told that the English class at ELI is wonderful so I started searching for class and how to admission applying for visa and flying to Pittsburgh. First I searched and printed out the application to fill out. Then I mailed in the application and the relevant documents. I was so worried while I was waiting for the acceptance letter from ELI because it took time for awhile. After I got the letter and I 20 I prepared my documents to apply F 1 student visa. Next I sent all the needed documents to U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Service to apply the visa. After two and a half month I had been waiting for the visa acceptance I got it. Finally I flew to Pittsburgh where I arrived my new place. I was so excited with everything around me places people and etc. The first couple days of school were a placement test registration and campus tour. The fourth day was the first day of the class and I thought that yes I am going to study English to achieve my gold before I go back to my country after the semester. Obviously the course that I am taking at ELI provided Listening reading speaking grammar and writing classes which are relevant to improve my English and enhance my future career. I am glad that I made this decision.
