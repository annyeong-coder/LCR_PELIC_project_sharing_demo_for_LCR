NOWRUZ HOLIDAY We have a fantastic holiday in my country called Nowruz. This holiday is at the beginning of spring and it is thirteen days long. Before Nowruz people go shopping to buy fruits nuts and pies. They also shop for new clothes and acquire gifts for the youngsters. Obviously Nowruz is the most beautiful holiday in Iran because people meet their relatives start a new year and eat tasty and delicious foods. First Nowruz is a great occasion in Iran because people meet their relatives and say HAPPY NEW YEAR to each other. In addition people receive their guest with nuts pastries and fruits. Furthermore they review their old memories and tell teenagers stories about their life experiences. Adults either buy presents or give money to young children to make them happy and cheerful. The other aspect of Nowruz is that it is the start of a new year. The members of each family cooperate in cleaning the house and preparing it for the special day. Moreover they celebrate the New Year by wearing new clothes and decorating their houses. Each family sets an elegant table by putting eggs rice vegetables fruits and our holy book Quran as a sign of thankfulness to God. Finally Nowruz is a brilliant holiday because Iranian people eat tasty and delicious foods. Housewife of each family makes a special dish for certain days. For instance she cooks white fish and rice for the first day and she also makes a pleasant tasting dip for lettuce on the last day of Nowruz. To sum up Nowruz is an awesome holiday for us because we meet our relatives start a new year and get the chance to enjoy tasty and delicious foods.
