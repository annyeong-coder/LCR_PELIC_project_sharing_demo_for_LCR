I jsut want to start the story from the part that children put Margot into the closet. In the closet Margot exhausted after countless efforts to open the closet is sitting quietly in the darkness. ' I have waited for the sun for such a long time. It should show its face now. ' Tears doesn't well up in her eyes anymore. The closet is too small to stretch her legs even though she is thinner and shorter than other children. Time seems to stop. A stuffy smell in the air is suffocating and the humidity pulls Margot down. The desire to watch the sun makes her frustrated. It becomes more and more huge and seems to devour the poor girl. She suddenly hears that children come close to the jail where she is locked up. Margot is surrounded by children who can't see her directly. The sun was like a penny and a fire in the stove. Said William. I could feel the warmness of the sun on my skin The sun was like a dream. Children start to talk to Margot who is desperately seeking the trace of the sun in the faces of children. At last Margot bursts into tears. She listens to children nodding her head.
