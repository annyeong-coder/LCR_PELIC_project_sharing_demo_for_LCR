Hi my name is ANON_NAME_0 Last Name and I prefer to be called as Last Name . I am coming from Pakistan. I come in the U. S. To get Master of Science in Rehabilitation Science MSRS but during my MSRS I feel that I have a little difficulty in speaking and understanding the English Language. So I am studying English in the ELI. I will continue my studies in the School of Health and Rehabilitation. I love to study and learn about my professional strategies in all my free time and I like to play table tennis and badminton.
