Pitt police chief Tim Delaney plans to ask district attorney drop all students' charges and those students who were arrested for failure to disperse and disorderly conduct during the G 20 Summit. Mike Manko the District Attorney's representative said students can bring evidence including recommendations to court to prove themselves' guiltless and they will prosecute students by case and merit. According to this article it is obviously that Pitt administrators didn't want to send students to the school's Judicial Board but someone else still can sue them such as student or faculty member. Students who think they're innocent can request a hearing before panel of faculty staff or students or ask for another hearing after they be agreed with violating the code.
