The child's parents Richard and Mayumi Heen who had joined twice the trendy reality TV program Wife Swap tried to get media's attention by this big drama. When Falcon talked at a TV show Larry King Live he said the event was for a show . The framework of investigators is pretending to believe the family's story then they lure them into taking a polygraph test or confessing. The Heenes have denied committing a hoax but they are unable to justify this action. They will be chargeable felony charges.
