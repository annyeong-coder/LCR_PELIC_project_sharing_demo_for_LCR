Welcome to Jeff's homepage. I've been creating the website since last month and I'll update it if I have new interesting events. I was born in Taiwan and my grandmother has brought me up in the countryside. I moved to live with my parents when I was five years old. My father has been teaching me how to play badminton since I was seven years old so I've always been playing badminton with him in my free time. I've been watching baseball games since I was a high school student. The baseball games accompany my whole life. Also I played baseball very well when I was studying in the university. But a baseball team is composed of nine people. It's difficult to arrange a team so I prefer watching baseball games. In order to improve my English ability I've been studying abroad for six months. In addition I hope to get a master's degree in the U. S. I sent the application to the department last November and I've been waiting for the result for three months.
