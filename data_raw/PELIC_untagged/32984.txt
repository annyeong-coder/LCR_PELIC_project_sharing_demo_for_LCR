One day in last year my phone was ringing. I pick up the phone and I spoke with someone who was from ad company. He told me some offers and I told him I don't need that offer but he insisted. So I hang my phone up. When I turn on my computer he call me back. So I get off my phone. In that time I couldn't cut down the number of calls that me receive.
