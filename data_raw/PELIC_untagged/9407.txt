My apartment caught on fire at the night of November 23 2007. We lived in the third floor of a house and the landlord lived in the first floor and the second floor. At first the smoke detector did not ring and no smoke could be smelt. But later I smelt a little terrible odor and also heard the landlord exclaimed loudly. So I went towards the window and saw the first floor had been besieged by fire and my landlord was asking me to escape from the house quickly. I was shocked at that time and tried getting out of house from the stairs. But the stairway between the second and third floor had been permeated by the smoke so that I could not see anything. Then I had to move back to the window of the bedroom and called 911 and my husband who was still in the lab . Before the firemen and police arrived a lot of neighbor got together around the house and tried to encourage me. I was told to be patient and use wet hand kerchief to cover my nose. Finally when the second floor was being burned the fire truck arrived and I was pulled out from the window by the fireman. It took them about 20 minutes to control the fire. The first floor and the second floor were totally destroyed and the third floor was fumed to be dark. Because we lived in the third floor we did not lose any belongings. But my landlord's stuffs were entirely burned up. Until now we still don't know what caused the fire but we really hope we will not face such kind of things any more.
