I hadn't met my husband at the University 13 years ago if I would have chosen geology career. However I chose Biomedicine and I met my husband at the University. In addition to that I had not been a pharmacist now if I wouldn't have changed my field when I was on College. But I changed my field and became a pharmacist in 2003. In 2006 my husband got the opportunity to do a postdoctoral here and I had an important decision to make. Had I stayed in Brazil I wouldn't have known a new culture and new places. If I had chose stayed in Brazil I wouldn't have improved my English. If my mother in law hadn't come to USA I wouldn't have been a full time student. Had her visa expired she would have to go back to Brazil. I wish she had more time to stay so I would have more time to study.
