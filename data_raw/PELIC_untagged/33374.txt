I am not going to live in leisureville even though it is attractive. In our culture children always take care about their fathers and mothers who are retired or senior citizen as a kind of giving back. Some children quarrel about who wins to take care about his her mother or father. As a result of that you rarely see like leisureville in our community. But who knows l might not have a child or have bad children so I think liesureville will be the second choice.
