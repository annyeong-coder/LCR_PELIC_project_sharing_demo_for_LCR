Hi I am . I have been studying in Pittsburgh for 6 months. I have met a lot of friend after I had arrived here. By the way I have gotten my midterm geared last week. I just can say it is not bad as I thought. I have been working hard on my home work for a while by the time I had played less video game also. Usually I play game every night with my friend but now I know I have to do my home work first. Furthermore I had missed only 2 class since last week.
