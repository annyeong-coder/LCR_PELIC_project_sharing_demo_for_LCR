Topic Dancing Adjective professional dancer Prepositional phrases in the group When I was in the Senior High School about five years ago I learned about how to dance so it makes me a good dancer. First I joined a group in school that taught how to dance. I had that class every Wednesday afternoon. I enjoyed it. Second I joined another group outside of the school. There they have some professional dancers in the group. This is a very good chance to improve my dancing. Third when I joined this group I met some good friends they also are pretty good dancers. I practiced with them almost every day after school. So that is why I can dance very well now.
