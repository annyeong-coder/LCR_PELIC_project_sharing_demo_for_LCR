My best friend who always wear classes. And who is interesting in mathematics. I met him at the restaurant which is a cross the street from the library. He has a car which usually takes a lot of gas. Also he has a girl friend whose take a lot of money. He has a father who is always ask him to do his work well. We hang up together to the video game which is behind my house. We play together in the park which is in the Shadyside. We study at the University which is in Auckland.
