In my opinion it's a good idea because it's necessary to tell the kids truth otherwise they might be confused and couldn't find an appropriate position for them. They might think they are not belonging to their adopted family and they want to know the reason why their birth parents didn't raise them which causes some mental problems. Hence letting kids know the truth is very important.
