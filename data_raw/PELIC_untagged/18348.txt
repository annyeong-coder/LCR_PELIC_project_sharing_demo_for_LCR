If I have to go to desert island I will bring knife matches and rope with me. Knife can help me prepare food. Knife may be used to protecting me from dangerous animal. I must bring matches with me because they are able to light fire for cooking food and warming. I should bring rope in order to tie my shelter. There are three things that I can't live with out them in a desert island.
