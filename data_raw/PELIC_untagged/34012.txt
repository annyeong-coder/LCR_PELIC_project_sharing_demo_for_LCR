A lot of villagers people do not appreciate how much educations have a profound effect on their societies honestly it is not their fault they do not understand that. Governments must educate their people to have successful countries. Furthermore villagers people have to seek to achieve that. If the governments are more conscientious this issue could not exist. Unfortunately a lot of governments are able to address this issue by corresponding with their folks. However governments might find alternative methods to educate villagers people by relying on other countries experience.
