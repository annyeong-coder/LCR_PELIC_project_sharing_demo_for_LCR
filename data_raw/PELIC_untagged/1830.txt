However when you read this sentence you feel strange because usually people say the best method for reading about anything for any intention is by online. I agree with this opinion completely but with out include the important issue in it like this topic because the book has numerous features that no something has it even the internet. Two months ago while I was trying to find a perfect stuff about MBA program online I didn't find something really satisfies my desire. However when I went to one of public library in Pittsburgh I found what I want. Thus I prefer to use book when I want to determine my choice on tough issue in my life for many characteristic that book has. First the book has more credibility than others. That means author usually mentions information which evidence has idea from right sources and perhaps he implies names for these sources around the information or in the end of book. Also any mistake in has book influences on has fame or book's wideness sale negatively therefore the author usually writes be careful to avoid these things. Second usually the book has a high status of benefit because most authors want to add something really new and helpful for readers in their books. Third the book saves your time that it usually comes with complete information if you choose right book for your topic. Fourth the book is easy to read it anywhere you want. I remember one time when I was in university I found a wonderful PDF file online about how to put up your relationship in university. However unfortunately it was written in approximately 300 ANON_NAME_0. Therefore I couldn't print it out and I couldn't read it in my break time between my classes. Only when I went back to my home I could read it from my computer. For of all that features I feel satisfied when I use books to decide what I should go for it in important point in my life.
