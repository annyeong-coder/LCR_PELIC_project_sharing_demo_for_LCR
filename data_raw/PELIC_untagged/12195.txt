Sometime hard work is not rewarded. I agree with this sentence. First of all hard work does not mean a good job and a lot of money but it is meaning a more work. For instance some people is not have a choice and is not study so their do everything for money. Second Hard working is tending to work industriously. You can work in good job but your health is ill. Third you do not have a time to free. If you went to go travel you do not go because your job is not finish that is effect to your society. Four your co worker may be not like you. They will do something every bad to you because general of coworker in the office do not want a person who is go up and hard work more than them. Also you cannot learn anything new in your life during you do hard work that will lose a new or anything. Six your personally will change to work. You will always think the first important thing in your life is work but the real is not true. Because you life have more thing that is important to you more than work. . In concluding hard work is not rewarded not answer and not the important in your life but you change to something is a real rewarded for you that is you feel happy .
