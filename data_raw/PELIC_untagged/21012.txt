Schwarzenegger should be eligible to become the President of the U. S. The U. S. Constitution's counterparts should be amended to allow U. S. Citizens born outside of the United States to run for president. As a U. S. Citizen everyone should have the opportunity to become the president of the U. S. Since the U. S. Is a democratic country democracy means everyone should be equal before the law and the God. Therefore running for president as a part of citizen's participation in politics must embody the equality. Moreover with the economics globolization the U. S. Hires a large amount of overseas employees. Considering that the president is just a position nothing but more competitive why couldn't we leniently abdicate the presidency to a U. S. Citizen who was born overseas Furthermore the rule that bans the U. S. Citizen born outside of the United States to become the President played an active role in maintaining the U. S. Security at the beginning. However this rule in the Constitution is out of date nowadays. Current completely polictical frameworks can compensate for the possibility of the throne's being usurped by other country's citizens. In conclusion in this democratic country we need some change to accomadate all our citizens without any discriminations against the overseas born Americans who are eligible to become the president as others.
