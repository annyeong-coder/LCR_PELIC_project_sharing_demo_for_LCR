Getting the desire IELTS score is my mystery. This exam is designed to evaluate English language proficiency. It has four sections. Listening Reading writing and speaking skills are evaluated. It is British version . So British accent is recorded and it is graded by Cambridge University. I have been trying this exam for 7 months and I haven't gotten the score yet. Some exams have been written in a difficult way . In order to study for this exam I followed some strategies. These strategies have been given by my friends and teachers. I took some classes for IELTS preparation. These classes were taught by native English teachers. Beside that I read information related to students' experiences were written on the Internet. Every day I practice some exam samples. My IELTS practical essays were corrected by my teacher. Working together with my friends in practicing is helpful but it doesn't work. I have been studying for long time. Every day pass my psychological status is affected negatively. One day I will solve this mystery.
