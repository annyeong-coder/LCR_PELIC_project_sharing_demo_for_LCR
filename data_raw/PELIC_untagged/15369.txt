In Greensburg have a lot of serious accident because of dear . It grows up specially in the spring and summer time. Some people die because of this and another people have serious hurt. It is dangerous. Last summer I had a bad experience I was driving when I hit a dear. My car broke but nothing happened with me. I am luck but not everybody have the same luck. People need to drive careful in the summer time but it isn't means they will be safe.
