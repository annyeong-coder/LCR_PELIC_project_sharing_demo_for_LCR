In order to help developing counties solve nature disasters caused by climate change rich countries need to put at least 10 billion a year. European countries are eager to contribute over 1 billion over three years. The U. S. And Chinese leaders made modest targets to help the global climate. That money will be spent on building coastal protection water supply irrigation systems and improve health. The World Bank estimates adaptation costs alone will add up to 75 billion to 100 billion a year over the next 40 years. All rich countries should make agreements as soon as possible because global temperatures are rising quicker than before.
