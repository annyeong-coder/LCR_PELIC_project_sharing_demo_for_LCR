By 1997 I HADN'T GONE on a trip abroad. My mother and I HAD BEEN TRAVELING some countries before I got the job. My oldest sister has lived in U. S. Since she got married. I HAD STUDIED English before I visited my sister. When I arrived at the Los Angeles Airport my sister and her children had waited for me. I had stayed in Los Angeles for 2 weeks.
