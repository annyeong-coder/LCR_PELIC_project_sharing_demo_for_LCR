I think corporations have to take a responsibility for their behaviors. Low professor Joel Balkan says Corporations are like amoral It means corporations endanger public health and our community because corporations just focused on making a money regardless What they will be a bad influence on our environment and public health even they overlooked the public interest as an environment human right and wel fare. Before it will be more serious we have to enact a appropriate law to limit their bad behavior and to give them a proper punishment when they break the law. Last of all corporations endeavor best to protect our environment the dignity of employees and human right and regard more public interests and wel fare all by themselves.
