About school you should review every day to keep up with the class. If you want to improv your Englsh you had better speak to your classmates in Englsh even if they are from the same country as you. You come to ELI to study Englsh so you should study hard as much as you can and you ought to respect your teacher. You had better not to be late for school. You had better to attend the class every time even if you don't feel like studying because you're tired. About housing you should find it before you come to Pittsburgh because it takes time to find the housing and I think you have lots of things to set up your new life in Pittsburh after you arrive in Pittsburgh so it should be done that you find the housing. About food in order to keep weight you should cook for yourself because American food especailly fastfood is very greasy and oily. If you eat out it also costs high. So you should bring your lunch which you cook st home. There is a cafeteria in CL but you shoud not buy lunch there because it's not tastey. If you keep you healthy and want to save money you should not buy lunch at cafeteria or fastfood restaurant. You should join every activity for ELI students to know about Pittsburgh and enjoy your life in Pit. But don't forget you're in the U. S so you must not go out alone at midnight. You should protect yourself to have your life in Pit safe.
