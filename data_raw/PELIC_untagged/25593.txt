One important thing that cheer me up in my home when I have clean home. In addition the first thing that I do while entering my apartment is to check out every thing that catch my eyes then I clean up what I can quickly. I like this way of living it's worked out with me when I tried it. Some time I feel bored of the style of the apartment so I sit down and try to figure out the problem with my wife ans most of the time we find out that we need to make a small change in order to solve the problem.
