In this cartoon the president Bush and an Arabic man are plying a game. Bush is playing checkers and the Arabic man is playing chess game on the board. Although they are trying to do their best to enjoy the game it is impossible to continue their game because of using totally different types of piece. From this picture it makes me imagine that they have different points of views to political issues. Consequently it seems that they can not understand each other.
