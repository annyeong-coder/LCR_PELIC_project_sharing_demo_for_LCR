Dear Serah Its been a long time that I couldn't write to you but now I am taking my vacation at the Elephant Rock Beach. I wish you were here too if you ask me about the Elephant Rock Beach it is a spectacular place to see. It is a place that with clean air cool and breezy with wavy ocean at the sea shore sand is very soft and gentle it is a pretty and a quiet place to take a brake from urban. I am hoping to see you soon Take Care of yourself. Best Wishes ANON_NAME_0
