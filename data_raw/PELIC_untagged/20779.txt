There are some advantages of teaching young children business skills and strategies. First teaching them business skills and strategies can make them know how to connect their social network. It is very helpful because good friends can always help you when you are in the trouble. Second teaching them business skills and strategies can make them think about the future. They can find what they are interested in. For example if they are interested in fashion marketing they will work hard in that field. There are also some disadvantages. I don't think it is good to make your little children learn business skill because they are too young. They don't need to worry about their future. It is good to teach them after they become elementary school students.
