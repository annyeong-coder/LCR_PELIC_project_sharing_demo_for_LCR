Quan is my best friend and we were classmates in the university. She always listened to me and supported me. She is peaceful and very kind. She helped me out of a tough period. When I was a freshman because of hard part time work and bad Japanese I lost my confidence and fell into a really bad time. Quan spent all of her free time to encourage me and help me. She relieved my depression and anxiety. There are a lot of beautiful memories between us and I'll never forget!
