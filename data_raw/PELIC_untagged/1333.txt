Nutrition is very important for us in these days. The health problems come from bad nutrition. Today I will write about comparison between !Kung and college cuisine diet in two point which is cost and nutritional value. The cost of in terms of time and money in !kung diet the men and women spend roughly equivalent amounts of time on their food procuring activities women provide between two and three times as much food by weight as men. On the other hand the college cuisine likes the quick and easy meals which generally very cheap so the microwave plays major role in student's life. The nutritional value of !kung meals like mongongo which found in abundance all year long contains five times protein per cooked until than cereal crops. Thus !kung have a highly nutritional food supply that is more reliable than cultivate foods. On the other hand the nutritional value of college cuisine is not healthy because it contains very intensive grease food and not fresh and most of time is frizzed.
