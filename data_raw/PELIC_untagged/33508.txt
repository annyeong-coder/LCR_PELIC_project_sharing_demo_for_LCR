What the crazy weather in Pittsburgh ! I thought when I was studying in a class at the University of Pittsburgh. The temperature has risen significantly in a couple of weeks ago with strong sunshine. For me who was born in tropical weather it should be a perfect temperature. However since I was getting used to cold temperature this was like living in a hell. I got some sweat on my shirt even though I was in an air conditioning room. How I can manage this week food ingredients my mind started floating away. I spent a lot of money and bought too much food for this week which I could definitely not finish it before being rotten. But wait!! The most important things that I had to do were finishing my HOMEWORKS! I could not dream about food right now since there was a ton of homework which was due tomorrow. After spending some time in daydreaming coming back to the real world was so tormented.
