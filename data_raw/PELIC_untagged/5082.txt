If he considered about the opportunity cost the cost of studying would be more expensive. The longer period of studying the heavier he feels the burden. Even if he made a decision to study again he may face to 2 major relationship to handle. First his family especially his wife can have a different opinion or disagreement about his decision. Persuading his family or discussing with family is most important step to be done. If there is a person who rejects to live in abroad and he ignores the family member it might be a big problem not to be controlled during studying period and family is not happy. In addition that's a relationship between colleagues. Because he has a different experience and had stayed away from the school for a long time he may not be good at studying again at the first time and needs more time to adjust his life in the school. A good friend may help him in that hard time and it is very important to him. According to the studying is over he should make sure about his future whether will study continuously or search for a better job. It may be more stressful than other difficulties because his future depends on this decision. If he decides to study more he must consider the conditions written above again. If he decides to make up his career he should find a better job than before. It sounds simple but his pressure is too heavy because he has lost some of time in studying and not sure about the condition of job market and economic status at that time. Someone thinks that studying is good and if you are a student your stress is only studying hard . However there are many returned students like him and they are depressed by the money imposed a burden relationship with family and friends and unexpected future. Because they have more difficulties in studying they have to take a cautious attitude.
