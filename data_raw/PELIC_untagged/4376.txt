In this paragraph I want to talk about problems that occur in dental profilaxy prevention as an important part of dental care . Dental prevention has two parts one is made by the dentist and another one is made by the patinet itself so the problems can occur from both sides. The patient should be compliant with about the instructions they recive but from my experience most of the time they weren't so compliant. The doctors must insist on explaining in details the instructions and also they could give to the patients helping materials to read and convince them about the importance of dental profilaxy. I also think that the dentists don't have to be critical with patients because that could have the oposite effect on them. Even in that process when might have occured some difficulties derived from differnt backgrouns that patinets had doctors can't allow to themselves to be less proffesional they must have done everthing in their power to improve the quality of dental care at their patients and they should have succed in that effort because they couldn't have afforded some bad results in any way.
