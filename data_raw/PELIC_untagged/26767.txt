I met my friend ANON_NAME_0 while I was studying at school in Saudi Arabia . He is my best friend ever . We spent our time together while I was studying in Saudi Arabia . Also I was sharing all my events with him . For example when we graduated from high school we made a big party I can't forget it for ever but there is a bad event happened to me before two years while we were playing soccer I fell down then my leg was brake and my friend left me to the hospital . Also while I was coming to US to study English he went to Canada to study because he was trying to get student visa but he couldn't . In my opinion everyone should have friends .
