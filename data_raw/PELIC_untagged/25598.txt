My bedroom is dim and in a mess. It usually brings me down. Therefore I want that my room can always cheer me up. First I may pick a new lamp up. Second I can clean up my room and hang my clothes up. Finally I should find out how to maintain my room. If I do these things I will have a comfortable bedroom.
