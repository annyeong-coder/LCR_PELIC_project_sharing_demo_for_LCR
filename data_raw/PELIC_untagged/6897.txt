First time I came to USA. I had to sign up with Comcast for internet that I find out from TV advertisement. So I called to them but the line was busy and they want me to hold the line on. After I keep on waiting the line I gave up then I hung up. After that they call me back. I picked up the phone and they came up with very fast English. I can't catch up all of them. I tried to answer their question but they sometimes did not understand me because of my pronunciation. It turned me down but the conversation went on. They tried to talk me into using their promotion. I had to think over the promotion that they offered and I figured out that I should go over it before I called them because I had no information about their promotions. If I had them it might make me understand what they said more than this. So I ended up this conversation and I told them that I will call them back. I thought that I will call them after I wake up. This conversation was turned out badly.
