My name is ANON_NAME_0 and I am 24 years old. I'm from Saudi Arabia. I'm living in a small apartment in Carriage Park. I'm studying here in Pittsburgh at Eli because I want to improve my English. I'm planning to study hard and prepare myself for the Tofel test. I hope to achieve high score in the test because I want to obtain an acceptance from one of the universities in Pittsburgh. My favorite hobbies are watching movies and traveling. My father calls me the smart girl because always I'm trying to learn a lot of new information.
