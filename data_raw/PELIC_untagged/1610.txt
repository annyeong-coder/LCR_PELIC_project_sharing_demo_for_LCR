There are two national rooms in the Cathedral of Learning named the Early American room and The Syria Lebanon room. Both of them are ancient and were owned by wealthy people in addition the University of Pittsburgh bought them long time ago and have been cared them for many years. Although these similarities there are lots of differences between them such as purpose of rooms their decoration and furniture. These dissimilarities show us how different were two cultures and customs. The first aspect that I would like focus on is purpose of these rooms. The Early American room is an example of New England kitchen living room in the 17th century with hidden bedroom above the fireplace. This is an example of living space for wealthy Americans people who needed to have warm home and protection from Indians. Unlike the Early American room The Syria Lebanon room represents a kind of the living rooms for meting people and also for religion purposes. People who had owned this room before the University bought it did not need to warm it so we cannot see any heating system there. The second aspect is decoration of these rooms which are contrast by the purposes of these rooms. Due to the Early American room purpose are mostly living in could climate and protecting family from envies this room have very simple decoration. Everything is made from the wood and handmade bricks. There is not fancy decoration in this room. In contrast the Syria Lebanon room has rich pained decoration. Both all walls and ceiling were painted with a special technique which made the room looks very beautiful and rich. The third aspect which I would like to regard is furniture in these rooms that also are different. The Early American room has simple furniture such as big wood table chairs metal dishes in the fireplace for cooking and bed with night table in the bedroom.
