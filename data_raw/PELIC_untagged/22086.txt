I met my friend Soojin when I was in middle school 2002. She was one of my classmates. Actually we were not very close friends when I met her for the first time. After the first semester about half of my classmates decided to volunteer in an orphanage every Monday. And we were placed to the same group. She was teaching piano while I was teaching Korean and mathematics to children. While we were spending the vacation together we could be closer each other. Actually she wanted to be a guitarist. So she was practicing guitar while I was studying hard. Eventually in 2007 she was accepted Seoul National University that we really wanted to be accepted but I failed the admission examination. So I delayed the admission and repeated an entrance examination in 2008. Finally I got an admission from the university. Although major and class was different we were spending wonderful time in 2008 2009. And when I decided to come here for studying she really cheered me up. I'm really missing her.
