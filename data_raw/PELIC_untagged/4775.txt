He and I were going to the same university and we were studying computer science together. We met a welcome ceremony at the fist. At that time he finished army and returned university and I was sophomore. When I saw him fist I was not interested in him and I considered he was just a classmate. However we were hanging out together because we were taking the same class and were doing the same project. Also he and I lived in the same town so always he escorted my house. As time past I knew he was a nice person and we fall in love. Now he is my husband.
