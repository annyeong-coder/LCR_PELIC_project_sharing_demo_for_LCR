There is a strong relation between them. First we learn to create. It means we took all these classes to train us how to innovate. What they gave us was the foundation that helped us to go forward. Also the teachers should motivate to build our personality from the way that teaches us. So we would be able to invent to create. Then we can complete the steps to the future to the best in our fields. Not always sometimes learning is to increase the person knowledge. Also it gives some information that help to direct our way or our life in the best way. Also sometimes it gives us facts for people's lives that we should know. Although we don't be ignorant in many things surround us. There are some students I remember them. I studied with them in the medial school and high school and they were very good students. Yet the system in the school was strict to exercise in the school or to show their talents. For example they were watched us constantly made us worry about grades made a high competition between the students and we did what they wanted for us. After that some of them succeeded and the others failed because the system didn't give them the opportunity to show or to do or to improve their talent.
