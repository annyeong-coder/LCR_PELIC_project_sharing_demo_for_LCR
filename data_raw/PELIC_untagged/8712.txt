Hatice is my friend who graduated from same high school. When we were a high school I had a big problem that was bring me down. One day I really get a bad grade that cause not to pass my class. I didn't know who to talk to. The test was so hard that everybody failed. Hatice came up to me and asked how I was feeling. I told her everything she was very caring. I think she has personality which is the number one in the world. After she cheered me up. At the end of the day I was no longer feeling bad. I always thank Hatice for being there for me. Since I have came here I keep writing to her letters which are always exciting. Next summer she is planning to come here. I hope she can come
