I met my husband for the first time while I was visiting in UPMC 2years ago. He came to the airport for picking me up when I arrived at Pittsburgh. He guided me Pittsburgh while I was staying here. It was impressed to me. We had a good time for one month after that I went back to Korea. However we were keeping in touch while we were living in different country. As a result we got merried and I came here Pittsburgh.
