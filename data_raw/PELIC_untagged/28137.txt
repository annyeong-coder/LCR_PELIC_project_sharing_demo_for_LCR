The difference between an acquaintance a friend and a best friend is very clear for me. First an acquaintance is a person who is a neighbor. Also he is a person who knows a little information about me. Furthermore he is a person who will never miss me if I travel. Second a friend is a person who I do some social activities with him. Also he is a person who I see everyday. Finally any one can have a lot of friends but there are a few who you can consider them as your best friend. A best friend is a person who you trust rely on and who knows all your secrets. Also he is a person who knows all your family and you consider him as a member of the family. He is a person who misses me when I travel and always contacts me. In addition he is a person who whenever I need any thing I will find him easily. Also he is a person whose secrets is my secrets.
