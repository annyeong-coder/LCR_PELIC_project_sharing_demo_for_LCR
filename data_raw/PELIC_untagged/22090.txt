I am going on a trip to an island next week and there are many things I should prepare. I need to take a lot of pasta and chocolate so I do not run out of food. I also need too much fresh water because clean water may not be available there. I have many maps of the area and I am only going to take three to guide me around there. Additionally I will buy a book Navigation by The Stars in case I do not understand the maps. Lastly I already got some fireworks which could be used in case of an emergency to point out my location. I am so excited about my trip and hope that I will have a lot of fun.
