I have already gone to Niagara Falls. I went there last weekend. We took a boat to close the falls and went to the cove of the winds. We could touch the falls there. However I have never gone to Europe but I really want to go. I would like to go to the Louvre Museum and see the masterpiece of art. I think that must been very fun.
