Transformers released by Dreamworks SKG on 3 of July in 2007 stars Shia LaBeouf Megan Fox and Michael Bay. The movie was directed by Michael Bay. He has directed many famous movies examples of which are The Island 2005 Bad boys 2 2003 and Armageddon 1998 . Transformers is an action movie including Adventure and Scientific fiction. In this movie you can see very interesting robots all of which are amazing and huge. There are two sides of robots one of which is human side and other one of which is evil side. I was able to see the best battle scene between the robots. If you have children the movie will be the best movie for them. However it might be boring for people all of them are the old to watch this movie.
