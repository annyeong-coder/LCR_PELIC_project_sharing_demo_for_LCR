When I was in class at lunch time today I have thought a lot of things on my mind. Firstly the toothache reminded me the hole in one of my wisdom tooth. So I was longing to see a dentist as soon as possible. At the same breathe I heard the noise of my stomach which embarrassed me again and again. I can't help thinking about some delicious food. Such as a bow of good tasting noodle soup matching small savoury biscuits and a piece of salad. However there still had several minutes before the break ANON_NAME_0 gave us several pieces of advice on improving writing skills. The amount of advice will be very helpful for me. I believe that the ELI classes should be practical for people who come from other countries.
