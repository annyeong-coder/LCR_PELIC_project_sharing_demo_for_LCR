One of my hobbies is ice skating. I have been skating since I was 18 years old. When I did skating first it was easy for me to skate on the ice because I have ridden my roller skate. I have skated especially in summer because it is cool in an ice rink. Moreover I have taught my younger brother but he didn't like ice skating. I was sorry about that I couldn't participate the activity of ice skating in ELI on this Wednesday because the weather was too bad to skate. If I have other chance to go to the ice rink I will join that in any case.
