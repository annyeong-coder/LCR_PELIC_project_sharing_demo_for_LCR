The place that I remember is the house in which I lived from my childhood. The house had a small garden so I enjoyed playing baseball and soccer with my friends. Although a friend with who I played when I was child became a father he still has a longing for the good old days. I also remember the days when I spent a lot of time happily with family and friends. However the house where I grew up disappeared now because of industrial development. Nowadays the house whose trace doesn't remain might exist into my or family's heart. My family whom I love is living in an apartment which doesn't have a garden so they also long for our old house. I think that the house in which I will live with my family should have a large garden for my children.
