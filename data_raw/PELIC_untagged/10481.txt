I'm angry. I work hard more. I'm shocked. I'll go to my boss's room. Talk about my job. Tell my idea. I get advice from my boss and friend. I expect a lot of reward next time. If my hard work is not rewarded I'm shocked. First I'll go to my boss's room. And I talk about this problem with my boss. After I think about another opinion and I tell my idea to my boss and friends. Next I get advice from my boss and friends. I work very hard. But I sometime take a rest for getting nice idea. And I refresh my body and mind. And I'm expecting reward next time I keep working hard. Finally I'll get reward. I think if it's not rewarded I can't continue working. Because I want to enjoy my job.
