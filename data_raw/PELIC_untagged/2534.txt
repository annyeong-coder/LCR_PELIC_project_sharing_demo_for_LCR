The mountain likes the giant who always stands on the ground. It is so huge that it's hard for everyone to get familiar with it. I like to clime mountains because I can enjoy the silence and fresh air in it. Every time when I am in the mountain it is so silence that I think I am in the heaven. I also love to deeply breathe the fresh air it makes me feel very comfortable and relaxed. The woods there also attract me a lot. If you observe the woods you can find a lot of images. Such as two trees grow together they may like two couples who hug together or we can find a huge tree which is surrounded by many small trees they looks like an adult is playing with children. Thus I like to observe trees and image the pictures due to their shapes. The waterfall is also a good view in the mountain. If we can find waterfalls in the mountain they are all amazing. Some waterfalls are very huge if you stand besides them you will feel the waterfall likes a huge monster who wants to kill you but if you can find a small waterfall you can enjoy its water falls as a smooth hair. Both of them have different points which attract me therefore I always stands behind waterfalls and admire them for a period of time. There are so many interesting things we can find in a mountain this is the reason why I like mountains a lot.
