I disagree. I think sterotype doesn't work well even if it is often fun. Especially when it comes to attribute of certain ethnic group stereostype doesn't help me with understanding people from different countries. For instance I heard that Japanese and Chinese are very good at business and they are practical and even greedy. But it's not true. At least the people I know are sensitive and kind. So I don't think stereotype could be useful method to understand different ethnic group or nations.
