There was many things that my family influenced me and I am going to give it to you. My parents got me to find my own goal by taking me to the science center when I was a child. I was excited to go there because there were a lot of machines that I could play. I really enjoyed playing everything about spaceship and also interested studying about it So when I grew up I decided to be an astronaut. My parents never made me become other career else. They supported me to reach my goal.
