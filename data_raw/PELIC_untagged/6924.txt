ENERGY IS THE BASIC COMMON NEED OF A HUMAN. IT HAS BEEN USED BY THE HUMAN VERY WELL AND IN HUGE. NOW IT HAS BEEN THE TIME WE HAVE TO SAVE THE ENERGY FOR THE FUTURE OF US. HERE ARE SOME OF THE SUGGESTIONS WHICH I CAN GIVE TO SAVE THE ENERGY. 1. ENERGY HAS TO BE USED WHEN IT IS NEEDED. WE CAN SAVE IT BY COMPLETING OUR WORK BY LOOKING BY SOME OTHER ALTERNATIVE WAYS SUCH AS COMPLETING ALL THE WORK AT A TIME. SOME TIMES WE MAY USE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION TO AVOID UUSAGE OF OUR GAS. 2. WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE AS TO MOVE IN NUMBER AS FOUR PEOPLE IN ONE CAR MAY SAVE SOME OIL. THIS HAS TO BE DONE BY GOOD PLANNING AND UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN US. WE HAVE TO USE THE LIGHTS AND A C WHEN NEDDED AND WE HAVE TO SWITCH OFF WHEN NOT NEEDED. 3. SOMETIMES OUR MAINTAINCE OF OUR VEHILES ALSO WILL LEAD TO OVER USE OF ENERGY. SO TO AVOID THIS PROBLEM WE HAVE TO CHECK ALL THE VEHICLES TO BE IN GOOD CONDITION. ENERGY IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THING OF OUR LIFE AND WE HAVE TO USE IT CAREFULLY AND WE TO SAVE IT FOR THE FUTURE USE OF OUR CHILDREN.
