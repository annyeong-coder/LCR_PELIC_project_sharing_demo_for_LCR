Saddam Hussein's military invaded Kuwait in August of 1990. Kuwait's environment has been polluted as a result of the Iraqi invasion. Iraqi forces started pumping the oil from tankers directly to the sea. Eleven million barrels of oil have been burned. In February 1991 the Iraqi forces damaged 1164 Kuwaiti oil wells. As a result the desert was damaged because many oil lakes had covered the ground water. . Now in my country we have a very big disaster because a lot of fish and sea birds were killed by Iraqi forces. Bacteria was the reason of fish and sea birds killed. There were about 2000 tones of dead fish were in the Gulf water in Kuwait. In my opinion it is a significant event and a real disaster. No one can conceive how many months or even years we need to find a solution for this problem.
