I had a good weekend last week. My family and our friends went to China Star to have lunch at 12 00 AM on Saturday. Because my friend will be leave the city. The Chinese restaurant is very famous in Pittsburgh. We are all like his foods. Then we went to shopping nearby the China Star in the afternoon. I bought some gifts to send my friend I wish we can miss each other. After that we went back my home at 5 30 PM. After have dinner we decided to play badminton. Because we haven't many chance to play together. We spent happy time in gym. Finally we went back home at 10 00 in the evening.
