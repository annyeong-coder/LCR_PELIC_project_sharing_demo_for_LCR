Becoming developed society is more complex and bigger. Now constantly it is changed by uncountable company. I insist that a number of firms are responsible for most people equate wealth with their success. First of all wealth should be distributed to people who need a sort of support such as scholarship for young students who deserve for it. Second corporations should invent educational institution or research institution to develop science and technical skill. An article indicated that Korea HP donated software and facilities cost of 200 million to a university. The last I think company should return natural resources which they destroyed and conserve them passed down to descendants.
