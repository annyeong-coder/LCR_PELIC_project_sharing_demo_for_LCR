My apartment is a good place. For example I live in the top of floor. So I can see outside sky. It is so beatiful and fantastic. I can see the stars a moon and some building turning on lighting. Also there is bright quite and clean in my apartment. However my apartment has two problem. One problem It 's so hot. I must have an air condition or a fan. If I don't have them I could be sweat and painful from hot.
