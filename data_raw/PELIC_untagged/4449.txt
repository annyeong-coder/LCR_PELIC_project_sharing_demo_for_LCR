When I was three years old I had a really strongly fever. It had been last for a week before my mom took me to hospital second time. At the beginning it was not really strongly my temperature was about 100F. The doctor in our community's family center gave me some medicine. But it didn't turn good. Actually after one week my temperature increased to 105F. I felt really tired I didn't want to eat anything. My mother took me to hospital again. At that time I was lying in my mom's hug. I couldn't know I was sleeping or just lying. I can open my eyes at any time but once I closed my eyes I found I was floating in air. My body wasn't controlled by me. Actually I could see myself who was hugged by my mother under the floating me . I could see the light above the hospital's ceiling. I knew I was able to pass the ceiling but I didn't want to do that. I felt it's really interesting. I opened my eyes and told mom what I saw. Mom seemed to be sad. She said didn't close the eyes keep them opened. I didn't know why but I followed her. I can remember the thing really clear. Several years later I know it may be a kind of die. I read some books about the similar feelings. No one can explain it but it did happen on me.
