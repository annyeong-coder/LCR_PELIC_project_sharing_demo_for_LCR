When I was a teenager in the Philippines I was an expert on snack and fast foods. I was growing fast so the more I ate the hungrier I felt. The street vendors in our town had better snack than anyone else. In the morning I used to buy rice muffins on the way to school. They are much sweeter than American muffins. After school I ate fish ballson a stick or adidas chickefeet . Snacks on a stick are smaller than American hot dogs and burgers but they are more varied. My friend thought banana cue banana on a stick was really great. However they weren't as sweet as kamote cue fried sweet potatoes and brown sugar my favorite snack. When I came to the US I didn't like American fast food at first. To me it was less interesting than my native food and less tasty too. Now I'm getting used to it and it seems more and more delicious. Does anyone want to go out for a pizza
