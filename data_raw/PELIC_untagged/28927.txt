Two years ago I have missed one of the final exams I spent the whole night studying for it The exam time was at 9 00 Am I just finished my study at 6 00 Am. Then I decided to sleep for two hours unfortunately I got up around 10 30 Am. I should have been prepared before the exam night. In addition I should not have studied all the night or I could have studied half the night but not the whole night. I could have asked my mother to wake me up. Unfortunately I did not pass this subject but I took it next semester.
