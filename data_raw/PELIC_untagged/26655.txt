I am a Chinese girl with long black hair on my back and glasses on my face. Now I am studying in ELI 4Q to improve my English. My company support me to study here because they want me to be a better employer. Certenly I have to work for them at the same time. For my part I relly want to prove my ability to my company. So I'll try my best to get a good grade. Thank you.
