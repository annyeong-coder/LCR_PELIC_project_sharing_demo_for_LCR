I moved to Brasilia capital of Brazil in 2007 order to work and study. While I was living there I met ANON_NAME_0 my wife. First I saw her in friends' house then I introduce me. When I talked with her she said that already knew. She also lived in Sao Luis my hometown but I didn't know it. We got friends initially after we began dating and now we are studying in Pittsburgh.
