In my point of view if tourism in my country was to double in the next 20 years would this be both good and bad things. For pro sides are as following first Thailand will be well known from people all over the world although Thailand is a small country. Second my country will earn a lot of money from tourism and investors will make investments in Thailand. Moreover Thai people will have job to do. It means that if the number of tourists who visiting Thailand increase the number of unemployed worker will decrease. Third Thai people will have a chance to learn other cultures adapt and adjust themselves in the same time. On the other hand Thailand and Thai people will get impacts from tourism. First if Thai people assimilate with foreign cultures they will forget Thai identity and it will be disappeared afterwards. Second the sightseeing place will be dilapidated and some of them will be destroyed because of over carrying number of tourists. Third the visiting places in Thailand will be dirty and have lots of garbage due to a lot of number of visitors.
