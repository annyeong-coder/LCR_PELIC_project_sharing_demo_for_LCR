They say Arabic idiom There are seven benefit points in the traveling to different places . One of those points is how could understand and know the similarity and the difference between them. Rome Italy and D. C. Washington U. S. A are two cities which I visited and I figured out several similarities and differences that I will focus on three points city life attractions and the restaurant type. The first point is the city life. Both of them are the capital city of them country. The life in each one are similar. For example the people usually are busy and they don't have time to talk and they drive fast. Of course in Rome the drivers are crazy than D. C. Drivers. One is the difference is the time hour of the shopping store. For instance it is difficult to find shopping store open after 6 p. M. In Rome and also in Sunday. But in D. C. You can find some of them. The second point is the attraction places. Both have great attraction places such as memorial and museums. But in Rome there are more ancients historical places like Clusm and Roman Stadum. The last point is about the type of restaurants there are big different between the two cities. For example there are little fast food restaurant in Rome. On other hand there are similar for pizza food Finally I can see there are benfit to visit differnt places to understand the differences and similarity.
