To start a relationship you need to think again and again before you start. You should know that it's a commitment that you should stick to for ever especially love relationship. Last summer I went out with friends to the mall I saw the most beautiful girl I have ever saw in my life. You might not see her as the most beautiful girl but to me she is. So my friends told me to go and talk to her in the beginning I was bit concerned but hen I couldn't take it any more and decided to go talk to her so I went for it and started by hi and kept talking and talking and I didn't want to stop but my friends calling. So I took her phone number and say goodbye. Day by day we know each other more and more especially while we are meeting almost every weekend we went to the restaurant some times we went to the movies. So day by day I got to know her more and more and I am really happy that I met her.
