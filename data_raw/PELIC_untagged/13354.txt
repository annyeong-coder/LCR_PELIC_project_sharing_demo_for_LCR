In my opinion the author talks about consumers instead of tourists because two reasons. First of all it is because for him the tourism is now an industry. So in the same way that the retail industry has consumers the tourism industry has them too as they are buying tourism. The second reason it is because in these days tourists are consuming the environment. I mean that tourist are not only enjoying and knowing the cities and places but also they are consuming a lot of the natural resources that these places have. And to do this tourists damage the environment.
