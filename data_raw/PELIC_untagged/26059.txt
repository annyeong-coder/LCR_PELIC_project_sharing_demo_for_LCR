Dear Mr. ANON_NAME_0 I am student at te EEL computer taining Institute. My classes are very good but the Institute had better some improvement or many students are going to leave. First I think you should clean classes because they are dirty. Maybe you had better buy extre computers to develop our classes. Perhabs you ought to repair the ceiling of classes. Also I think you should create helpfull roles to arrange classes. Finally you ought to transfer the garbege to outside of classes.
