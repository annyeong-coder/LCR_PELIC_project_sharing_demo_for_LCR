First I think being on time is most important in a relationship. In my case if I have an appointment I try to go a little early so usually I waited for my friends when I met my friends. But they didn't keep the appointed time so sometimes I was angry with them. Second usually I don't speak before someone tells me something so I have several best friends. Some people think that is bad for me but I think that is good for me because my friends are loyal people. If I have a problem and I call them they come running to help me. Also if they have a problem I will do that. Therefore I don't keep relationships with friends who easily tell a lie. Third I have a girlfriend and I met her 8 years ago. These days many people associate with someone and they seperate very quickly. I don't like that. A few centuries ago we had Confucian ideas so that still exists in our minds. So I try to maintain the relationship with my girlfriend in addition to believing in each other. I think that is very important to lovers. In any case if I meet a stranger I try to speak politely and I behave carefully because I hate it when someone feels I am rude. Furthermore I hate it if someone was an offender who is one of my friends so I pointed out their mistake regardless of places. In conclusion if you want to keep relationship with someone I recommend you to maintain good manners.
