I don't agree with the idea that telling the truth is the most important consideration in any relationship. Generally we should tell the truth but sometimes it is beter to tell a lie to keep good relationship with people. It can hart people. For example when I hate a friend I don t say him that I hate you. If I say that I must not make a good relationship with him.
