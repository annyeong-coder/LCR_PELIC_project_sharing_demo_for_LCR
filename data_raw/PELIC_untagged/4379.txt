Learning English English is the most common language in the world. Learning English is very helpful to communicate with the other people who don't speak my native language. Also learning another language helps me understand their culture and thoughts. One of the reasons why I decided to learn English is that I have wanted to know more about the U. S. 'S culture. Since the American people have made remarkable progress in a very short term and I really wanted to know their culture. In addition I wanted to discuss current issues with the people who are from the first country in the world. Another reason is that I can learn English more effectively by being here and speaking with a native English speaker. I'm quite sure that I can learn English easily by interacting with them in my daily life. So I'm here in Pittsburgh to learn English and I have learned so many things that I couldn't have learned in my country.
