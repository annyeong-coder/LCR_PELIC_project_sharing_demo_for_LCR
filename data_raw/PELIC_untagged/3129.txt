I don't think there are people give a gift of money but even someone did it I will use it immediately. I will buy a gift. The question here is for whom What should I buy And from where In my opinion if I had a gift of money I will buy a gift for my mother because I love her so much and I miss her a lot. I haven't seen her since 9 months when I was in my country before I came here to the U. S. And I hope to see her soon. I want to give her anything expensive and important because she means a lot for me. She means life hope mercy and everything good in this life. She was trying to make me a good man and responsible to face the life problems and I want to get these back for her. For very important person in my life I have to buy an expensive cute gift. I want to buy a piece of jewelry or a watch that she remembers me when she see it and said this is from my lovely son. I cant give my mother what should I gave her because she gave a lot by taking care of me teaching me and she was patient because I was very noisy boy. Important person means important gift. I have to buy this gift from the biggest and the most famous jewelry store in the city because the gift is for my mother. Then I will put it in an excellent gift bag and give it to the very expensive person in my life my mother. I have to be honest when I want to talk about my mother. I have to get back her even a small thing from a lot things that she gave me before and now and what she will give it to me in the future by an expensive piece of jewelry from the most famous store in the city.
