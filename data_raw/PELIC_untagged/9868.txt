Hello I'm Minsuk Last Name . Thank you for your visit at my website. I have been preparing to open this site for three months. Finally the work is almost finished. However there are a lot of insufficient things. First of all I've thought my information myself for this site. I was born and grew up in Seoul South Korea and I had been in the Korean army for 26 months. I like many kinds of sports so I've enjoyed playing soccer since 2002. Also when I was a child I used to play basketball and baseball with my friends. I began to enjoy skiing a few years ago so I've read books related with how to learn skiing. These days I've been studying English for 5 months at the ELI in Pittsburgh. I arrived at Pittsburgh in Aug 22 2007. I've lived at Shadyside for 4 months. Here is a new challenge to me. I met many diverse friends so I'm happy. I've often updated new pictures for my visitors. Enjoy your interesting in my homepage. Thank you.
