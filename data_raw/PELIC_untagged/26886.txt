Those festivals are Eid Al fitr and Eid Al Ad'ha . This topic is going to be about Eid al ad'ha This celebration is the main for Muslims It's just 70 days after Eid al fitr. Saudi Arabia is one of the countries that follow the Islamic tradition on the cultural way therefore this order came from God to his messenger to remember this event and celebrate it. Then we start scarify either cows or camels. The meat goes as a charity and gifts a third portion of it for poor people and a third for family and neighbors. The date of this festival is counted by an Islamic schedule and date it's the tenth of tholhejah and it comes 70 days after Eid al fitr around November. The atmosphere of those days are very different starts from the crowd in the streets malls and airports because all the pilgrims comes to Saudi Arabia to practice al Haj in Mekkah . People goes to buy a new stuff for their houses gifts clothes and even cars are on sales that time. To start new year with a good price goods it's a great idea to start shopping during these days. This festival is the greatest of all for Muslims. People demonstrate that by wearing new clothes and visiting in groups to greet each other making food and making gifts as a happy ending for that year. Also money is given to family and beloved ones as a sign of celebration for this day. It might last for three days but it's the only time throughout the year where everyone shares the same happiness at the same time. There are a few differences between every family for this celebration but the general feeling are exactly the same I really like it and I'm going to miss it this year being away from my family. May god make the next year as good as that day.
