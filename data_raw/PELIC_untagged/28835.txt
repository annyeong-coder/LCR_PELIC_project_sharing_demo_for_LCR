Men and women have equally abilities of learning. Although nowadays the majority of scientists and engineers are male I believe that in the next century the majority of the scientists and engineers around the world would be female. Currently many female students are pursuing the PhD in field of science and engineer. With regard to an article in the Time magazine recently numbers of the female student majoring in science and engineer are dramatically increasing. Generally most women are keen on integrating their academic knowledge and their social skills therefore they can easily maximize their professionalism in their career field better than male. It is an inevitable truth that women having encouraged for studying science will become influencing the scientists' world soon.
