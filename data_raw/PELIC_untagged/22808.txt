When I was in high school I used to be late in maths class. My maths teacher used to give me a lot of homework to write a theorem five hundred times. I did not used to finish my punishment myself. Paterne my best friend used to help me each time to be done with it. We were very close so friendly and used to help each other in the difficult situations. We did not use to be call by our names but by our nicknames. Paterne used to be call Pat. He did not like the name at first but finally he got use to it. Ganggel was my nickname and my girlfriend used to pronounce it with difficulty and sometimes with a mocking ring in her voice.
