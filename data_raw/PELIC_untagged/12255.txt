From the sentence we could identify that children lost they sense of the pleasure in their own creativity when they are at third or fourth year not in the first or second year. It means that at the first year of the school children enjoy of being at school. But what happened in school had killed their energy and curiosity. There are psychological pressures from teacher or peer that inhibit a child's creativity. Then the authors continue their explanation by providing Dr. Amabile's research about factors that could kill creativity which is surveillance evaluation rewards competition over control restricting choice and pressure. In the article the authors mention Teresa Amabile's experience when she was in kindergarten and elementary school. At first she enjoyed of being at school. But when she was in elementary school they were restriction choice surveillance pressures grade and control from her teacher. Consequently she lost her enthusiasm and her intrinsic motivation to exhibit her creativity. In my opinion it is true that what we experience in school could inhibit our creativity. For example when I was in elementary school we were told that leaves are green grass are green sky is blue or white. It was a mistake if we colored leaves by red. The restriction killed our creativity we always colored leaves by green. Later we knew that there were red or yellow leave.
