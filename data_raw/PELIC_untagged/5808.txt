I had never eaten corn bread before I came to US. I have known that corn bread is delicious and that all Americans like the home made corn bread since I saw some American movies. I had wanted to eat corn bread for long time but I had not been able to find it in Japan. I had thought that making corn bread would be difficult for me because I had never made any bread. But after I came to America I learned that it is very simple and easy to make. I was glad to know this and went to Whole Foods to buy corn meal. But I found an easier way ready made corn bread. Since I found it I have bought it every time when I go to Whole Foods.
