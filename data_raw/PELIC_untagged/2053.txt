My stay in Pittsburgh I came to Pittsburgh one month ago I DIDN'T LIKE it at first but I got used to it. I am STUDYING ELI at University of Pittsburgh then after that I will join the university. I'm not used to this cold weather but hopefully I'll get used to it. I'm not STAYING with a family I live in an apartment. I always take the bus to go to the ELI.
