Thailand is very famous as a tourist country. It is located in south east Asia. Bangkok is the capital city of Thailand. It has a lot of nice temples. Also there is a famous night life road called ANON_NAME_0 San it has many good restaurants bars and shops. Actually there are a lot of things to do there and everything is cheap. Moreover Bangkok has a river called Jao Phaya which goes in the middle of the city. This river has a lot of beautiful big boats which have floating restaurants and they can take you in a quick trip around. However you can also travel between cities by this river. In south of Thailand there are a lot of islands the famous one is called Phuket Island . It has very gorgeous beach houses and you can swim dive and eat fresh sea food. One of my friends told me I think in my country if you love the sea you can go to south of Thailand because it has a lot of beautiful islands . I think Thailand is the exact place for people who love nature and modern life at the same time.
