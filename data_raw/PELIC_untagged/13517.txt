In the last few years I have been to some different countries some European like UK France and Germany Tunisia the Arabic country in the north of Africa and to UAE in Asia. During these journeys I simply noted that each country has its own culture based on its people backgrounds and to some political issues according to its government. In this essay I'll take the two countries Libya and US as examples to write about some culture aspect in both countries to see how much both are similar or different. I will focus on three considerations to talk about social life food religion. Social life in Libya depends on strong relationships between our big families these relations appear clearly in some events like our festivals where all people try to help and support each other for example if someone is going to get married he properly will be helped by his neighbors and friends they will help him in very details stuffs. Here in US the matter seems different because from the beginning Americans believe in the individuality and they have a limited family relationship. Food is another issue
