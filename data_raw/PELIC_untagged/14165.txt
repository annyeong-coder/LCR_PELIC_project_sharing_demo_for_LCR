The most exciting thing I think is everyday after classes I can go to the gym and it's free. Because the classes just take me about 6 hours so I should find something else to do. Doing some exercises can make me healthier and fit. It's so good to take a shower there when I am exhausted after the one hour exercise. When I get out of the gym I feel relax and not cold at all.
