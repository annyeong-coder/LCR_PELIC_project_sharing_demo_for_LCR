At first I have to straighten up my room and throw out some garbage. I will buy a new powerful lamp and tear down the dark colored curtain to brighten my room up. I want to take away these old pictures hang up some new pictures that my daughter picked out for me. I will look over my bookshelf to take off some books I no longer need. I believe a redecorated room will cheer me up.
