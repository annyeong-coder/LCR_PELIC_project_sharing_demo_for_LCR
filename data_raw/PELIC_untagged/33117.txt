I am fascinated by mysteries. Mysteries are incidents that were not solved after they happened in the past. For example how the pyramids were built in the ancient Egypt and what kinds of technologies were utilized before thousands of years These mysteries have still investigated by archaeologists. Recently many hypotheses were proposed by archaeological scholars. But they were doubted because they did not believe that the ancient Egyptian had sufficient skill to set up these magnificent structures. However they believed that the pyramids were made with aliens' help. Actually this is another secret problem that has being discussed for a long time. Some obscure phenomena about alien occurred in our live. Although they were usually captured the phenomena could not be proved by scientific methods.
