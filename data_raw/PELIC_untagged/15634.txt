I was an elementary school teacher when I was in Korea. If I had not gone to educational school I would not have become an elementary school teacher. When I had to decide school where I go I wanted to go to school to study English but I did not. I could not go to school I wanted because I did not get good scores. If I had studied hard at the high school I would have gotten good scores. If I had gotten good scores I would have studied English. If I had studied English I would have spoken English fluently. I wish I could speak English very well. Therefore I go to school I can learn English nowadays. I wish I could go to school continuously during I have stayed in the US.
