I have lived both in a small town and in a big city in my country. Comparing a small town life with a big city life is very interesting because they have inherently differnet features. First of all unlike people in a big city ones in a small town enjoy peaceful atmosphere and fresh air. Those who coose to live in a small town lead a quiet and not busy life. On the contrary people who live in a big city can't avoid toxic pollutants which generate many kinds of diseases. However livning in a small town isn't always comfortable. For instance people in a small village can't gain access to public services such as convenient transportation system or health care while those in a big city take advantage of the services. In addition people in a big city have many opportunities to experience cultural events including art performance and exhibitions.
