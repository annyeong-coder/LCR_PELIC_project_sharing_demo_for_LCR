Tife where I grew up is a small city on the east coast of Saudi Arabia. My family moved there from vacation the winter I was born. I don't remember our first house which we rented from a relative but when I was seven we moved to the house I grew up in. This house where my parents still live is on a King Abdallah street in Saudi Arabia. To me this was the best place in the world. My mother had a big kitchen where she cooks there. My two sisters slept in one bedroom and my older brother and I slept in the other. My youngest sister shared a room with my grandmother who took care of her a lot of the time. ANON_NAME_0 is my brother who lives with me in the U. S. My sister who lives in Canada call me every day. I remember when I went to my country in December 2008.
