Too much money was spent to reduce the air pollution but unfortunately we do not see much progress. From my perspective I believe that people should have been taught about the suitable solutions. In fact we can find out that car gas is considered as one of the principal source of the pollution. The air pollution is damaged by many things such as factories and density of population. An oil is used for many uses the factories can not work without the oil.
