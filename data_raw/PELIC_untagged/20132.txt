I watched many movies forgotten quickly by me. But I have watched a movie named A Unfinished Life two times. It narrates a simple story impressing me. After a traffic accident a father lost his only son whose wife caused the accident due to her careless driving. The father drove away his daughter in low living in his house. After many years the father and the daughter in low forgave each other while meeting again because their different experiences having them understand that they should recover themselves from the misfortune. I like the movies letting me something from it.
