The important decision that I have made in my life was that I came to the U. S. Last June. Actually I had longed for studying in the U. S. For a long period of time. I had once passed the program that I could teach Japanese at elementary schools in Wisconsin for a year but at that time I was not able to go because my parents were very against it. In 2001 I tried to go to San Francisco ELS. I paid the application fee and accommodation deposit to it but at that point I could not go there too because of 911. Last June was the first time when I was able to come and study English in the U. S. Successfully. If I had gone to Wisconsin to teach Japanese at that time I must speak English fluently nowadays. If had been to San Francisco at that time I would have been working in Japan now. It is a little difficult for me to imagine what I would have been doing if I had not come to America last June. I might have been working in Japan or I might have gone to study English in Canada. I really think that if I had come to ELI last June I could have been spending a happy life. Now I can not speak English fluently and can not understand whole of conversations of movies and News yet. I would like to continue to study English enjoy to stay here.
