3F Tae Fun. ANON_NAME_0 Jan 30 07 Studying with Mozart I believe that classical musuc is helpful to me. There are two reasons for this. First of all I can memorize some vocabularies and read something better when I listen to classical music. As a matter of fact some professors maintain that listening to Mozart while studying helps students do better on tests. From this data there is little doubt that it's helpful when I study with music. Second of all it's helpful to listen carefully while taking notes then rewriting the notes over and over again. For example I've never forgotten the spelling of vocabulary if I write some word on the paper.
