I come from Viet Nam. I have graduated for two years. My major is Public health. In Viet Nam public health doesn't still flourish as much as other countries. That's the reason why I wished to study abroad in order to continue my learning. Now I'm studying English in Pittsburgh to improve my English. I intend to apply for master program at University of Pittsburgh. Being accepted by the university will be my great happiness because I can broad my awareness of taking care of the community especially the unprivileged group of people.
