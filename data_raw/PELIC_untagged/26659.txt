I am a Chinese male student studying in ELI of University of Pittsburgh now. My Grammar teacher is Peter. This is my first semester in ELI and I am so happy to know so many friends here. I'm a very easy going person and I like to play sports games in daily life. For instance soccer swimming PingPang and etc I do practice every week. Furthermore I like cooking delicious food and enjoy the progress. I can cook different kinds of meat fish and if I have enough time I would try to make soup. My favorite food is sea food especially the crab. I like it so much that I can eat five to ten crabs once. Today there was a teacher asked me what is my favorite color. I told her it is blue because it is the color of Ocean. The meaning of my name in Chinese is Ocean! Finally I am a graduate student in Carnegie Mellon University and major in Information Security. I hope I can improve my English skills in listening reading speaking and writing because I find that it is very difficult for me to follow the professor in lecture and I read book slowly. I hope I can improve my English greatly and catch up with the speed of the professor!
