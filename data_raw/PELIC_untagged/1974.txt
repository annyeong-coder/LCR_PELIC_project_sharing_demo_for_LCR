I have been to some other countries but the most memorable trip was th trip to China. When I was 12 years old I went to China to see several famous things. First I went to see the Great Wall. It was really huge. I had never seen such a big and long building. I spent a whole day to see it but I couldn't see all of it. I could only see r really small part of it. Next day I went to the Forbidden city. It was a palace. The travel guide sait that there were 9 999 buildings. I couldn't see all of it either. After I saw this palace I went to a restaurant. There was a lot of food. First I ate Korean food and then I ate Chinese food. The Chinese food was a little different from Korean food but it was good. This trip was very memorable because it was the first trip to the overseas and I was impressed. I felt how big China was. I could feel many things because of this trip.
