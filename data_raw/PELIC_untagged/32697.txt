After a long journey I arrived to Pittsburgh on the 7th of May. Later I called my cousin who lives in Pittsburgh to pick me up from the airport. He already reserved an apartment but I needed to fill out the contract at the leasing office. I went to my apartment and turned the air conditioner on and hung up my clothes. The apartment had furniture and I liked it but I needed to turn the bed around. I also put down the curtains and threw the old curtains out because they looked dirty and ugly. I changed the carpet and touch up the paint. Its'not the best apartment out there but my cousin didn't let me down.
