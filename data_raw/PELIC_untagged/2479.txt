My family has been living in an apartment since I was a child. When I catched up my sister in elementary school my family had moved to a new house. I never forget our apartment because there were many beautiful events happened. I had been studing until I graduated from university. Befor I met my husband I had taken bachelor degree. By this time I hadnot met my husband yet.
