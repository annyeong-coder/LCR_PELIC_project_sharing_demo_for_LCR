Most of you have very few best friends throughout you live. There are friends who are loyal to you though good times. This picture was very important to me because I remember all my friends when I see that picture. So the picture that I had discusses friends is by ANON_NAME_0. I have a lot of good friends. My friend who lives in Canada visits me often. Becky who introduced us at the party called me yesterday at night. She's the neighbor whose house is for sale. South Hills Village is a city that attracts a lot of tourists. ANON_NAME_1 is my friend who lives in Oakland. Amera is a person whose friends are important to her. Those are the people who live in the U. S. Amera who lives in DC came to visit me this month. Tresa which remind me of home is my favorite vacation spot.
