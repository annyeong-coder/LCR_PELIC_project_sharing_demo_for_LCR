When I was young my parents made me exercise everyday. I hated exercise but I changed my mind. I enjoyed myself and I got my friends to go to the gym. Also my parents let me learn the Ballet. I had learned the Ballet for 7 years. When I moved to another city I quited the Ballet. I regreted to quit the Ballet!
