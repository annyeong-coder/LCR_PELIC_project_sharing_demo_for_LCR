Nowdays our lives are so monotonous that we usually get depressed and exhausted. However in order to get stressed out it is the best way to watch the sports game. I will show you my experience of what I went through before. When I was little I had hard time making freinds. Even though I'm not good at doing excercise I really like to watch sports through the TV. Therefore while I was watching the TV broadcasting sprots I could interect with peers. Furthermore sports have a role providing entertainment to people who are exhausted from t heir lives. You might already have this experience. If you watch sports game you might feel better than before. I also adicted to sports so whenever before I went to sleep I used to watch sports news. For this reason I think that sports are valuable.
