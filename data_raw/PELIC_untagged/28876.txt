Food in Taiwan is more diversity than food in the United States. Taiwan is a warm country and there are a lot of farms and crops. People in Taiwan usually eat rice eafood meat vegetables fruits noodle. Fruits and vegetables in the United States are not as cheap as fruits and vegetables in Taiwan. But cherry in the United States is more tasty in Taiwan. Seafood in Taiwan is fresher than in United States. Most people in Taiwan like spicy food also food in Taiwan is more spicy than food in United States. Finally I got the same point in my mind. Fast food in Taiwan is as taste good as fast food in the United States.
