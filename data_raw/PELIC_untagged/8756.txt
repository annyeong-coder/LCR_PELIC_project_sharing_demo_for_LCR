1 Vegetable 2 meat 3 skewers 4 barbecue 5 coal There are some steps to make my favourite dish barbecued kababs. First of all put the some coal in the barbecued and light it. Then cut the meat to little piece and vegetable too. Next add some pepper salt and little oil to the meat. Also mix everything and keep them almost 30 minute until the meat saturate the spices. Next put the meat and vegetable on the skewers. In addition put the skewers on the barbecue and cook for 20 to 30 minute. Finally put the skewers on the a big dish.
