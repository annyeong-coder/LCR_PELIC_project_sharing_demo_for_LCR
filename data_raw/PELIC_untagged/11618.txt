If I was to start a business I would be inclined in an unconventional way like Anita Roddick. There are some things what I would like to modify. One of them is to advertise my products. Advertising usually helps salesmen enhance their profit. For all salesmen advertising their products is an inevitable way. The second one is to sell products in outlets. Outlets are very popular and a lot of companies have the core selling business in outlets. In different ways my opinion corresponds with Anita Roddick's business ideas.
