A friend is a person who has same interest with you. Since I have an interest about photography I met many friends. My friend Cho which has totally different social background became my soul mate. When I met him he was a senior photographer at the university newspaper which was very famous to students. If I wouldn't like photography I never met him. At first time we didn't know well each other. But he and I ran into many times under same situation. So we became familiar naturally. He is the only person whose philosophy of the photography is same with me. Now he is working for the newspaper company which is second biggest company in Korea. He dreams to be a best photographer who works for the world.
