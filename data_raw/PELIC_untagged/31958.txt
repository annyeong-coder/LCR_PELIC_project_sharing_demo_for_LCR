Last summer I had a wonderfull journey to the beach. I can not forget waht ever I had seen tasted smelled or touched around the sea. The sight was beautiful there were alot of boats moving here and there. Children walked on the place carrying thei kites they were trying to follow the parachutes which were so far . The sounds at the beach were very soft we just heard people talking and laughing the voices of the seabirds and the seawaves inspired me to relax. I believe that sea has a special smell and I semelled it there was little humidity. I touched a lot of things such as sand seashell and sunscreen. Also I uesed beach umbrella which was flexible to me.
