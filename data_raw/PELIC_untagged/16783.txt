I met my friend Hugo while I was taking free ELI class of the Joblink which was organized by local government. First of all I thought he wasn't a sociable and easygoing person. I found he reluctantly talked with me though we are both from China. However my concept was changed by participating in the Diversity Night activity of the town while we were living in. In this activity Hugo and I and other Chinese volunteered to prepare Chinese food and tried our best to show Chinese tradition food to local people. After that we organized and took part in other several Chinese activities such as Chinese Spring Festival celebrating and raising money for the charity of earthquake. We had become more and more familiar. Now we are good friends even we are living in different city we often say hello to each other.
