It is true that if boys and girls are educated separately it will be beneficial for students to focus on their studies. However in my opinion boys and girls should be taught together for the following two reasons. First of all boys and girls need to know and understand each other. By get along with each other they will not only learn the characteristics of men and women but also figure out different behaviors between men and women naturally. As a result boys and girls can grow up without a BIAS against the opposite sex. For example my friend attended a boy's middle school and high school. When he entered a college he was surprised a lot because many female students were much more active and dynamic than he thought. It took a long time to ADAPT himself to mixed sex society which is not desirable for most students. Second if boys and girls are educated in a same class they will study harder and participate in class activities more because boys want to win girls' favors and vice versa. It can be a good stimulus for students. Of course teachers should offer equal opportunities for boys and girls. According to a recent research girls graduated from a mixed sex school express their opinions more strongly and participate in school activities more enthusiastically than girls graduated from a single sex school. This shows girls' opportunities to participate in classroom discussions and activities are not restricted by mixed sex schooling. For these reasons I strongly disagree with this opinion that students should get a same sex education. We should recognize that our ultimate goal of education is broadening understanding of other people and the world.
