Learning from the past is something we need to do because we can know what the mistakes are. Now a day almost all the books and all the researches that people do depends on what the past studied. I think it is the root for everything we have and we just devolving it. If anyone comes from the back and read the new studies he she will know half of the information because it was there on his her time. I believe we should learn from the past because we can learn our mistakes then we can fix theme. Also learning from people who have a huge experience is something necessary for all of us.
