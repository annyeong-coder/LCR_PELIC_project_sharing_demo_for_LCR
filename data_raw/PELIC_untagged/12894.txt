Dear Fed Up With Dog Poop First of all I must admit you are a very patient and nice guy. However you shouldn't be acting like that you've got to put an end to this. It is essential that she clean up after her dog and it is important that you let her know about this. If I were you I would have not been tolerating her dog and I would be transparent with her and tell her that it is crucial that she teach her dog to poop in certain allocated place. Should you have any comments regarding my advices please do not hesitate to write me back.
