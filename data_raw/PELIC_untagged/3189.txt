Someone may arguer that to give one long vacation each year for students should be enough because they think students should spend their all time in learning and studying. However as a student I would like to say that students should have at least two or three short vacations throughout a year. In my point of view I would like to separate a year into three or four selections as seasons counting. Because we are human being taking several short vacations of a year can help us to recover energies and after the vacations we can devote all our vigor to the learning and studying. That is why schools always have three or four terms not one semester for a year. In addition I believe that as Amuel Johnson a writer British said The foundation of knowledge must be laid by reading General principles must come from books which however must be brought to the test of real life. It means whatever we have learned we have to use into our life. So when we catch our knowledge at the same time does not forget our real life. For example for me while I have a vacation it can help my mind and body to take an all rest rethink what I have leaned and done in the past and how to do for me continuing my future. To sum up while I have several short vacations of a year it can assist me to recover energies view the past experiences and find future goals.
