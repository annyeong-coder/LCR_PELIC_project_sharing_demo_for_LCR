As I am a registered nurse in King ANON_NAME_0 Specialist Hospital I read about your program of oncology training. I would like to have this experience in your hospital. Working with oncology patients I find out that it is the field of my interest. For that I am enthusiastic to be one of your candidates to join the program. I believe that I have the required skills to deal with different kinds of oncology cases. Having this experience I would greatly influence my department. A leader in my field I will pass on the knowledge I acquired to other staff. I believe that I am one of the best applicants to this program. Please update me with your final decision. Thank you for your time and I am looking forward to hear from you. Sincerely Sumiyah
