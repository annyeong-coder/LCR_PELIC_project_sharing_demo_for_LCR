Actually she SHOULDN'T HAVE AGREED to marry David. She SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT about marrying David a little more continually keeping a good relationship with him. If she had more time to think about that she might not need to worry whom she have to choose between David and James. I think that calling off the wedding with David as she just feels attracted to James is a foolish act. So she SHOULD ponder a this matter.
