As we all know childhood is the brilliant period of one's life. My childhood was sort of mixed blessed. In my early childhood I lived as any dreaming child live. I was depressed after I had attended the elementary school owing to the ignorance of children expectations. At the first class we were not allowed to take a break or play soccer that annoyed us. Some rules were unjustified which meant there were no particular system controlled those rules. Four years later the situation changed because a new group of teacher had come. One of my teachers who I respected compensated my work and encouraged me to do the best I can. Indeed it was a departure point to the creativity and seriousness horizon.
