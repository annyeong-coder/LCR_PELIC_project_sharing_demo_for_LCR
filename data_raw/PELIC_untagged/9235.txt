I have a lovely sister who works at a bank in Korea. She is two years younger than me but she is as tall as me. Of course she is lighter than I am in weight. Then she looks younger than her real age I think it is because of the history of our family. Actually all of my family members including me have young faces. Next she has splendid long black hair. Also she often likes to change her hair style. So she sometimes has big wavy long hair or sometimes she has straight long hair. In addition she has big eyes and double edged eyelids unlike me. Moreover she has bright skin color and a good smile. Therefore people who have ever seen her think that she is feminine and benevolent. However I know that she is not as affectionate as her appearance. First of all she is selfish and doesn't take a conciliatory attitude to me. Especially she yields an inch on that food so we sometimes squabble. Once someone came to my home with Haagen Dazs Vanila ice cream and we put it in our refrigerator. At that time I had no time to eat it because I had to go out to finish something. I was only thinking of the ice cream while I went out. However I didn't eat it because my sister ate it all. I was really angry and asked for her about it. Then she said Why didn't you eat it before I eat it . On the contrary she sometimes makes me laugh because she mishears what I say. Once I asked her Do you try the cheese snack but she misheard me. She heard 'employment' instead of 'cheese snack' 'employment' is pronounced as 'chui jik' in Korean. Also Such things are a daily event. Finally I wish she would conduct in her appearance. Then I think that she can be more lovely woman than what she is.
