Marrying from other different countries is something spread nowadays. It is incorporation between two different culture and religion. In my opinion marrying someone from another different religion has a lot of disadvantages which has a bad effect on the family. The first reason is that the parents will face a lot of religious resistance during their children's upbringing and may have a serious problem between each other. For example each parent wants to raise their child as the same way of his her rise. The other reason is that there will be a lot of psychological conflict in children's life. For example they will see different way of praying if one of the parents is Muslim and the other one is Christian. However in the school they will be confused which religion they are if any one of their friends ask them about their religion. It is nice to be open to other cultures and religions and not to be strict just on yours but there is many different ways to do that instead of marrying. Marring is a big responsible. We have to be more careful and serious about it.
