I like my home because of bright. My home always lights up by sunshine. So I get up early because the brightness of my home. However my room need a change. My dress room is too small so it makes me feel bad since I can't tear down the wall I hope more space. And I need to move around furniture and I put away least favorite clothes because I want to more space. Finally I should throw away trashes.
