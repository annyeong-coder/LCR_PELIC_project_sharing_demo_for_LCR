I think the idea here is that when we move to another country some times lose our Identity and the traditions that we grow up on specially in the case of Yolanda where her parents were the one who immigrated from there country while she and her sister where raise in the states that's why she refers to her parents as the old world because their ideas on life are traditional compared to here
