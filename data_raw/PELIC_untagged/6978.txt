I have a lot of friends in my life. One of my friends who lives in my hometown is a childhood friend. We have known each other for 25 years. She knows me just like my family. One of my friends who is 5 years older than I is my first love. We live in separate lives each other but even now we are good friends. And my best friend who is a surgeon is living in Nagoya. When I was a college student I met her. We spent many times together in our youth. We know very well each other. She is my most precious friend.
