Everyone has a different personality which makes him behave differently. In these following humble lines I am going to demonstrate a few features of my personality. My father whom I admired always encourages me to be honest under any circumstances. Thus I am trying to be honest as possible as I can. I am compassionate that makes people love me a lot. Also I loathe arrogant who feel they are better than others. I never being an arrogant or behave in an rude way to treat people. Mr. Jabber who was my English teacher in high school told me that no place for an arrogant in people's hearts. Always I feel there is no difference between people whatever their status. Moreover I work very hard to achieve my goals which were pointed before. Therefore I feel happy when I got to my target. Also I always keep favors to people whom I owe favors. In addition I like reading novels especially that were written by Shakespeare and Charles Dickens. I read a lot of books that talk about ethics and other related topics which have affected my personality.
