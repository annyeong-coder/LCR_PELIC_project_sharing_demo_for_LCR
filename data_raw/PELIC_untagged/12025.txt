Shrek which earned lots of prizes is my favorite animation . There are many funny characters in the movie . Shrek whom I like a lot is a big green monster . In order to have a quieter environment he went to save Princess Fiona who was imprisoned in a big terrible castle . On Shrek's way to the castle he met a friend Donkey which can speak like a human and very talkative . They went to save the princess together . After they saved the princess they found that she is a monster too . She is a monster which changes her appearance only in the night . Because of this reason Shrek falled in love with Fiona . They broke through many difficulties and got together . The ending which shocked everybody is a happy ending . Everybody was shocked by the plot that two monsters live in a happy life together .
