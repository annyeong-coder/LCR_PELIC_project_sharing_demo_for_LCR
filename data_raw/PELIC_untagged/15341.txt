A best friend should be a person who know you deeply and who company with you when you feel sad and give you advice. Furthermore a best friend will become your family that you cannot separate. For example Heather who lives in Australia now is my best friend. Also Heather who always supports me looks like my older sister. Every time I feel frustrate so I will give her a call. Her words which encourage me to keep going are very useful. In my opinion a best friend that we do not need to spend all time to together. The most thing is she always on your side.
