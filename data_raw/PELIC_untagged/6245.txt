The personality category that fits me most closely is introvert . An introvert is essentially a person whose energies are activated by being alone. There are some examples can prove that I really is a typical introvert . First I don't like attend some kinds of parties which involve many different people and made loud noise. Second I like to do things which I can control by myself. I don't like study in group when I take the ELI classes. I always think I can do better if I do it alone. Last I really like do many things by being alone such as read books go shopping watch move or TV and so on. I feel comfortable at the time when I am alone. I am an introvert but I also have many friends I really like. I contact some of the friends who have relationship with me about 10 years when I feel happy sad or on their birthday.
