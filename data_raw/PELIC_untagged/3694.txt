Houses in Pittsburgh Riyadh indent Houses in Pittsburgh are completely different from houses in Riyadh where I live. In other words there isn't any similarity between them except the word houses . The primary differences between the houses in these two cities are shape size and privacy. In general shape of Houses in Pittsburgh is very simple and humble. Moreover the houses resemble each other. Sometimes I can't distinguish between them. Also I don't see any embellishment on walls of the houses. On the contrary houses in Riyadh have a variety of shapes. In addition most of them have embellishments on it. Many houses have been built in a sophisticated way. Mostly size of the houses in Pittsburgh is smaller than in Riyadh. In general each house in Pittsburgh doesn't have more than three or four rooms. In addition the rooms are very small especially the bedrooms. Therefore houses in Pittsburgh don't have large spaces. Compared with Pittsburgh most houses in Riyadh are composed of at least four medium or large rooms. Thus those need large spaces to establish rooms and other parts of house on it. Most houses in Pittsburgh have an open back or front yard and some of them have both. Similar to Pittsburgh most houses in Riyadh have yards however these have more privacy in tall walls around their yards. Unlike in Pittsburgh houses in Riyadh are separated from each other by tall walls. Therefore nobody can share people or see them when they in their houses without permission. In conclusion shape Size and privacy are three big differences between houses in Pittsburgh and Riyadh. Consequently I have a challenge to adapt in houses in Pittsburgh.
