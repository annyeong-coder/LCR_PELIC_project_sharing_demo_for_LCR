Three years ago I had an accident. I was on my way to Caracas when my taxi was hit by another taxi. Immediately the driver called 911 because we were injured. After that the police and an ambulance came to check us. The taxi driver and I were checked by the doctors and they said that my arm was broke. Then the policeman started to ask a lot of question and the other driver was interrogated to explain what had happen. The driver said that he was not his fall. The accident had been caused by the traffic light because it was broke. However the policeman found out that the driver had been drinking alcohol and he was taken to the police station and was arrested. Thank God the accident was not serious but many accidents are caused by irresponsible people who drive drunk and they do not think all the damage that they can cause to others.
