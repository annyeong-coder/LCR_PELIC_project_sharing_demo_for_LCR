I met my best friend when I was sitting in front of him. He was annoying me when I wanted to focus. After the class has done I talked to him to make him stop but he didn't he annoyed me much more instead. However I told the teacher about him while he was playing outside to change his place. When my friend knew that he decided to hit me after school. I was scared so I told the teacher again he took us to his office to talk to him. My friend apologized when the teacher left the office. While the teacher was out we talked to each other and became friends. After a while we became best friends.
