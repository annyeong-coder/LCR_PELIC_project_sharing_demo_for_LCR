When I was a child my parents were too busy to look after me so my parents always took me to my grandparents' house. My grandparents who I really love lived near by Takashimaya. Takashimaya where we spent many time staying is a famous department store in Taiwan. If my grandparents were free when they finished housework they took me to Takashimaya. That was really a good memory which I think often. My grandparents always bought a lot of toys candy and clothes for me. In my memory one time my neighbor who I envied had a new bicycle and I wanted to borrow her bicycle which she was riding. But she didn't want to lend me and I was so sad. When I went back my grandparents' home I cried loudly. My grandparents were scared and asked the reason. As they knew it they took me to Takashimaya to buy a new bicycle immediately. The bicycle which I owned was more beautiful than my neighbor's. I was so happy and I've never forget that day. Takashimaya is an important place for me.
