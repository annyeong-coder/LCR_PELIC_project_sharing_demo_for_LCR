It is pretty hard to say whether open adoption is good or had. It is still strange for me. The most important point is the adopted child. What is the best way for the child In my opinion open adoption can make the child very confused. If I were an adopted child I would feel very sad if my biological parents' situation is really miserable to raise me up. On the other hand if their situation is not so bad I could not understand why my biological parents gave up raising me. Both situations are not helpful to the adopted child to live his own life. Also I think that adoption is the last way which biological parents choose. Even thought their situation is not good to raise a child they should do their best to raise their child. So the example in the article is not understandable for me. In my opinion Moriah Dailer and Camren Weigand were able to raise Phelan if they really wanted to take their responsibility. For me they were just selfish they did not want to take their responsibility but want to see and contact the child.
