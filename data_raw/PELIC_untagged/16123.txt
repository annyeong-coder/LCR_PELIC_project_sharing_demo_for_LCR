My hometown is near the capital city Seoul and that town was a rural area. My mother has lived for 15 years. However my hometown has been changed into an urban area since 1998. Many apartments have been building and lots of people have been moving to my hometown. Hence many shopping malls and restaurants have been opening. My hometown has been developing. Instead my hometown has been getting traffic problem. The people have been buying cars. As a result the car has been increasing. On the contrary parking space has been decreasing.
