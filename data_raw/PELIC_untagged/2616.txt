Before I came here I had just finished my military service in Korean Army. I had been working in department of military supplies for 2 years. I think it was the lowest point of my life because the part of supplies is one of the most important part in Army so I had had to be perfect with the matter of foods clothes materials like wood steel and so on. Especially November 12th 2005 there was the APEC Conference in Korea and unfortunately in my city Busan where I had been staying for period of military service. I experienced the life in the hell for 2 weeks. So when it had just finished it was the heaven all around the world even the regular life in Army. But two things I got in Army are health and friends. As I had to keep regular hours my body kept good condition for that period. And maybe I needed some friends to rely on because it was a hard time.
