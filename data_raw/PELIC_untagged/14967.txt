ANON_NAME_0 is my best friend. He was a classmate and roommate in high school. I first met him in our dorm. He came in the dorm while I was cleaning my bed. After I saw him I stopped my work. I helped him to bring his luggage into our dorm. When we were talking our teacher came in. He asked us with him to take a tour in campus. We were happy to do it. While we were walking in campus we were talking each other. We visited our Leaning Building library playground and dining room. We went to register after we finished this tour. Later we had first dinner in school together. During the following three years we studied together and played together. He was a good card game player. I liked it too. We often played this kind of game. We enjoyed the high school life and gradually became good friends. I miss him.
