There is the day of Happy New Year in Korea. We celebrate this holiday in the lunar calendar. It is one of the biggest holidays. I'm always happy whenever I have this holiday because I can be relaxed and I can have lots of delicious food for few days. We do many things such as ceremony for ancestors formal bow to elders and visiting to our ancestor's grave. First all relatives come together the head house in the morning on this day. We always prepare a great deal of food the day before Happy New Year. We set the table and arrange food to have a ceremony for ancestors. We perform the ceremony if we finish the setting to prepare the ceremony. The purpose that we have a ceremony for ancestors is to treat and respect them. Second we normally have a formal bow to elders. Young people should bow to their live elders to respect and pray that elders live for a long time. Elders usually give words of blessing to young people after young people bow to elders. Sometimes they give money that has the meaning that they want young people to earn lots of money. Third we visit to our ancestor's grave together. We pack up the food that we set the table for ancestor before we depart. After we get our ancestor's grave we set the food in front of their grave or monument and we bow to our ancestor again like what we did in the morning. Sometimes we cut a lawn while we are going to grave. Finally the day of Happy New Year is to treat our ancestors and to pray a good harvest and fortune in New Year. It's really nice opportunity to know about Korean culture and I'm already expecting that I'll have Happy New Year of next year.
