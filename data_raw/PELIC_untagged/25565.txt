The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is the largest Arab country of the Middle East. It is bordered by Jordan and Iraq on the north and northeast Kuwait Qatar Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates on the east Oman on the southeast and Yemen on the south. The Persian Gulf lies to the northeast and the Red Sea to its west. However I would like to intrduce our cuisine that contain brown flour meat and vegetable. In fact our cuisine are different from the nourth weast east and the south regions. Indeed the relationship between the members of the family is very close.
