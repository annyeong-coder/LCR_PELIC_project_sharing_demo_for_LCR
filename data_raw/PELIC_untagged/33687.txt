Do you have good friends Everyone has friends who say that we are friends but a few of them are good friends. I think that I am lucky because I have a good friend whose name is Sultan. My friend whose age is the same as me is the best friend. We started studying in Taherih School which is elementary school. He is from Saudi Arabia which is located in Asia. Sultan who is honest is a teacher. He has three brothers who are older than him. He is married and he has a son who was named after me. Maybe we are friends because we have similar characteristics. He likes soccer which I like. And he likes movies. Sultan who is intelligent likes to help people. I remember a story that occurred when we were in high school. He made a box that was used as a locker. The box which was wooden was extra so he used it to create his idea. The locker which he made had electronic filing PIN. He awarded a prize which was thousand SR when he had represented the school with his invention.
