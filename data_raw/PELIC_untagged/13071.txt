Hi everybody. I'm writing this note to introduce my self to you my classmates in English 047. Our teacher wants a profile from each of us. At first I was confused by this assignment because my English dictionary defines profile as a side view of someone's head . I thought Why does she wants that She sees my head every day! Than I saw the next definitions a short description of a person's life and character. OK then. Here is my profile My name is Student's Name . Some of my friends call me Pay Ha because that is how my initials sounds in German. I am studding English here in Miami because I want to attend graduate school in Colorado or Montreal. Maybe you are asking yourself Why does he want to leave Miami to go to these places The answer is snow! I come from Australia so I love to ski. In fact my nickname in my family is Blitz lightening because I always try to improve my speed.
