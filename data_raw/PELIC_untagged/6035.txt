The research by Deborah Tannen a linguist of Georgetown University found that the different gender communicate to others differently. First of all the idea of perceiving power is totally difference. The men present themselves as leaders but the women emphasize teamwork and similarities rather than that and these can also be seen in boys and girls. Another difference is verbal habits such as topic of conversation the way to discussion. Furthermore the response from the requests is different. Women give the reason to reject the request but men just say No . Moreover women are aware of good looks when they communicate with others.
