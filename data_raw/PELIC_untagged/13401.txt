I am going to talk about view form my window. Centre Ave. Is in front of my window. A lot of people and cars pass Centre Ave. Everyday. My bus passes it too. It is very busy. There is a cross in the right. There is a big house on the steer another side. It is very old bundling. I think it has ten more rooms. It has a big front garden. The garden is very beautiful. There are a lot of rose in the middle of the garden. There is one big tree on each side in the garden. These tree are green in the summer but they are yellow in the full. Three are many birds on the tree in the morning. They sing very interesting. Two boys often play in the garden. The view is very nice. I like it.
