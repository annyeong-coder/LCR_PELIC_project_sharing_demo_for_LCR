Having a friend is one of the important and difficult issues in the life. Also people who look for friends have different criteria for selecting their friends. In my opinion I think it is very difficult to find all of the qualities that I look for in my friends in one person. So I select someone who has some of them. There are some qualities which I like in someone who will become my friend. First of all I'd like someone who keeps my secrets and at the same time who respects me and who understands me too. Then I like a sensitive person who listens to my problem and who helps me to solve it. One of important things is a reliable person who always tells me the truth. That will let me trust him her when s he gives me advice.
