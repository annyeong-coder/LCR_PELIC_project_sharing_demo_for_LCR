Every year we have a festival in Kuwait. It calls Hala February Welcome February . It starts in February and the last of end of this month. This festival celebrates Kuwait's independence. During this festival people celebrate by parading in the street gathering with friends and shopping outdoors. Throughout the day people parade in the streets of Kuwait. People always come gather and celebrate on Gulf Street. At the beginning of the parade people are waving Kuwaiti flags. The music is played and people dance. Children play with foam and there are competitions in many games for families. This festival attracts all people even if they are not Kuwaiti. You can find your old friends by walking in the street. Everyone should walk with his or her friends because it helps them refresh their relationship. When you see your old friends you will be happy. That happened to my family last year when they went to the ceremony. They met our neighbors that they were not seeing for while. They had a great time. Most people really like one part of the festival and this part is shopping. After people have met their friends and celebrated they go to shopping at discount is sold all product. For example when you buy something such as a computer before the festival it costs 500 Dollar but during the festival you can find it for 250 Dollar. We always buy clothes and electrical appliances for the home. In summary Welcome February is a famous festival in Kuwait. During which we enjoy in the march meeting friends and shopping. The Hala Festival is a great opportunity for young and old alike to participate in a kaleidoscope. I advise people to visit Kuwait during this festival.
