The most important reason why the ELI at the University of Pittsburgh is a good choice for student is that ELI has experienced and qualified teachers. In my opinion teachers are the most important factor for achievements of learning English. Actually I am new in ELI but the first impression is always the most important of all impressions and I could not get a better one from the ELI here at the University of Pittsburgh. From the very first day our teachers at the ELI are so kind and helpful they made me feel very comfortable. That was very important for me because it was hard to leave my home and come here. They understood that and treated me with kindness. Also they helped me in whatever I needed not only with their program but also with life in Pittsburgh. Our teachers are excellent and they really know how to handle their classes. They have the patience that we need and they don't angry with us when we made mistake using English. Also they are very creative in planning class activities and lessons. We are not boring in the class because we made a lot of activities during the lesson. We spent a lot of time with my teacher chatting after classes. This provides improving our speaking ability. I think the ELI is a great English institute and our teachers are very competent and their teaching strategies are very effective.
