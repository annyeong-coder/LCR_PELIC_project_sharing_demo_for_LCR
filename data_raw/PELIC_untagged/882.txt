Oct. 16 2006 Dear ANON_NAME_0 I sold my car last week and I want to buy a new one and I want to choose one of two types of cars one of them is Honda and the other one is Ford. First Honda is smaller than ford because there is Honda with 2 doors. Second Ford is more spacious than Honda. For example Ford has 4 doors and a spacious trunk. Third Honda doesn't need a lot of gas like as Ford. For instance You can buy a gas for Honda for 35 but Ford needs 50. Fourth The engine of Honda is stronger than Ford. The fastest speed In Honda is 260 km h but Ford is 200 km h. Finally Honda is more expensive than Ford because it's stronger and more economical than Ford. I want to tell me what should I buy please Sincerely
