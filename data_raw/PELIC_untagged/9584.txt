This summer is going to be exciting if every things will go on my plans. First of all I'm going to buy a new car to take us to the Toronto Cannada. Second I'm going to find out homestay around there I'll look on the internet after I finish homework. May be I'll ask my friend to do my homework instead of me. I think she will be OK if I pay the tomorrow lunch for her so I'll have more time to look for a great homestay. Now I'm going to call my friend. Finally I'm going to look for someone to go with me only woman. My summer is going to be a special time.
