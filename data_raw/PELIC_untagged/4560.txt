First way I usually try to schedule my weekday time at the beging term. Then I start to fill stating by the prorities job in my life like my pray times and daly house duty to don't let my school's homework interfernse with them. Secound When the term startI try to read and prepare the subject before the class to understand more information than if I don't it.
