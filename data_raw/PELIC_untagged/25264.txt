When you see a person who succeeded in their life you can feel that they have a passion. Passion helps people to approach their goal easily. According to story of Evelyn Glennie she overcame her disability. Finally she achieved her goal even if she was profoundly deaf. If people don't have a passion there is no meaning to live. I think everyone has a passion in their mind. It encourages people to do something and it's sort of potential power.
