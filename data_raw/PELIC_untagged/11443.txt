KANYE WEST and SNOOP DOG are both professional hip hop musicians known worldwide. When you listen to their music you can find many different things. First Kanye's voice is more powerful than Snoop's. Snoop sings more softly than Kanye and Snoop's music is smoother than Kanye's. Snoop raps less slowly than Kanye. And Snoop's lyrics are more violent than Kanye's lryics because Snoop's music talks about drugs sex and violence. Sometimes I can't understand Kanye's lyrics because his lyrics are more difficult than Snoop's lyrics. And I think Kanye's fashion style is better than Snoop's. But their music is equally popular worldwide. So I love both musicians.
