Every time when I get into my apartment I feel secure because its the only place my privecy. I always turn the air condtional on becuase it hot in summer. I hang my jaket up in front of the door. I wish I throw my couch away becaue it's old. One day the light went out and I spent all day without light but I like my apartment. I always make it up cleanly.
