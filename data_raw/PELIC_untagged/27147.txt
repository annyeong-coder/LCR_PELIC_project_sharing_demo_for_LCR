It was long night before my 18 happy birth day. I have been waiting for this for 10 years. To get my driver's license is great thing. I have been thinking that if I get my driver's license I would be free from my parents. So before the day I complete my 18 birth day I have been preparing my documents for the license I also had been training how to park the car smoothly. I had been thinking that I won't make it but thanks god I have believe in myself. So in that day I went to the DMV and did my road test end the result were fantastic a succeeded in my road test so I was happy.
