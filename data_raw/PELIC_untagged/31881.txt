Hello I have been meaning to contact you but I have been busy lately. You know I studied my master degree in Australia two years ago. However I have not done any research or papers after that. So I have been looking for interesting topics in my field of study to initiate my paper. I found some topics about social networks and programming languages. Therefore I decided to write something about them. That is after I have contacted couple of professors and asked for their advice and cooperation in my research. Anyways tell me about you what's new in your life my friend.
