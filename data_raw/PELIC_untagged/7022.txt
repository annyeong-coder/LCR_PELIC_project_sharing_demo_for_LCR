My best friend who is graduate student is Korean. His name is Nam Hyuk Kim. He is 25 years old. I met him in middle school which is named Young Dong. Now he lives same town which is called Yangjae. We went to each house much time. Before I came here we had drunken together whenever we had a problem. He who don't have girlfriend is handsome guy. I don't know why he don't make a girlfriend.
