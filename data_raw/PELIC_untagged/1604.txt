We had a great time when we visited the international rooms. We visited the Syria Room and the Early American Room. We found some similarities thing between those rooms and we also found a lot of differences. The international rooms located in the Cathedral for some years and there are some organizations paid for built those rooms. In addition there are some fees for visit the international rooms but we visited them without any fees. However the differences between the two rooms are obvious in the show or the size the furniture and the decorations. First of all the size for the Syria Room is smaller than the Early American Room and it shows the living room in Syria house in the long time ago. But the American room shows a completely part of American house in around the same time of Syria room. In American Room there are a chicken the sitting around the fire place the bedroom and the closet . While in the Syria Room are sitting place and the place for pray which called Prayer Niche or Miharab in Arabic language. Secondly the furniture are more different between those because the size. In American Room are a 9 foot fireplace built of old hand made bricks out handing and there are some iron cooking pots and some chairs and the spinning wheels and two guns and a big table in the med of this room in the one floor. In the second floor there are a bed old picture old babul and the cover of the bed . But in the Syria room there are sitting place which are not high then normal sits and not low in the floor.
