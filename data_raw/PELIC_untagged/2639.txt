Centre My Apartment in Pittsburgh indent I live in Shadyside in a two bedrooms apartment. It is located near schools hospitals and shopping markets that makes it very accommodating. It's on the 6th floor so it's pretty sunny with a gorgeous outside view. When you got inside the building you will feel that it's very old one like a cave. But when you get inside the apartment through the entrance you will see that it's like a palace. Directly in your right there is a large closet it's large enough to make it as a bed room. Then when you go a bit further you will be in the living room which is the best place I like to set in. I tried my best to make it clean because my friends usually visits me in the weekends. During the week days it usually unregulated like a kids play ground. After that when you go a bit beyond the living room you will see the kitchen which is small like a closet but I use it a lot for making my lunch. Then you can see the bathroom in the right and my room in front of you. My room is in fare size it's usually unfettered unlike my roommate's room. But I try to clean it up every weekend. Finally I like to live in my apartment and I don't thing to change now.
