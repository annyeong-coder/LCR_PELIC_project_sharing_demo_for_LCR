There was a real terrifying crime which occurred in front of me while I had been waiting for the bus. Because my car was broken and sent to fix for several days I had to take the bus to go to everywhere. When I had been reading and waiting for the bus I heard some police car whistle loudly far away and it was approaching towards my way. It must be the policemen chasing some criminals. I was not interested in what was going on so I kept reading my novel. After 5 seconds the greenish station wagon got pulled over in front of me and there were seven policemen jumping out of the cars holding guns and yelling at the people to get out of car. The suspects were barked by two gigantic dogs. What a shocking scene! It was an existing danger because the direction of the policemen's guns targeted the criminals in which I was being pointed. I was dumbfounded because it seemed that I was the only criminal there. I never saw seven guns at the same time and they all aimed at me at once! I was beginning worried about my life and also I was afraid that I would have been captured as a hostage. Lucky the criminals didn't resist policemen and got arrested. When they were laid on the ground it's surprising to know what they were all very young people around the age of 20. I saw they had frightening expression on their faces after getting caught. I started wondering what they could have been done. In fact I didn't have time to question the policemen because my bus was finally coming. I must not have been known what happened but it's a very thrilling experience to me and I was very glad that it has been recorded entirely when it occurred.
