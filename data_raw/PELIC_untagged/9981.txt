In my opinion Neckell's words seem more convincing. There are two points mentioned by Neckell I am totally agree with these points because they are logical proofs. First Martin may have highly facilities of imagination and gathering information these facilities can help her rebuild the clues and find out the answer easily. The other one psychics are no more successful. Comparing scientific studies and psychics there are only more guesses but nothing more useful.
