It is not a good thing to build prisons because it indicates that there are bad people. It is not good news to hear about. Unfortunately sometimes we need to build prison to achieve the justice. Because it is not fair to let the killers and thieves free. I absolutely agree with building a new prison because there are many positive things can be achieved. The first thing can be achieved is justice. When someone kills another one or robs a bank or cars I think the best place for him is the prison. This will let people live in peace and away from dangerous. Another thing that can be achieved by building the prison is to reduce the crime rate because when someone knows that he will be jailed if he tried to rob or kill anybody. This will give him a feeling of fear of prison. Consequently he will not do anything bad. While there are some people against this because they say that the government should find an alternative way to punish those people rather that building new prison. I understand their point of view however that will not be a good choice to punish the bad people. But I think that it still the best way to punish them. The alternative ways are not effective like prison. In conclusion I think the government should build the new prison as long as it will help them to reduce the crime rate and let people live in peace. Also because the prison is one factor of achieving justice in any place.
