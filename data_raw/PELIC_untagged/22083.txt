I met my friend Emanuel Nartey by the first time while we were living in Italy as students at the Pontifical Gregorian University Rome . We went to the Library to look for a book with the title The Invisible hand author Adam Smith . We both wanted to read the book because we were preparing the reading for a test after two weeks. Nartey was the first one who asked the book and I was following him to get the same. I asked him to let me make a copy after getting the book from the Library and he said there was no problem. So after that moment we became good friends. In 2000 we went to Germany to have a summer course of German Language in order to be able to read some original books of German philosophers. During the studies in Rome we were preparing our lessons together. While we were studying we several times went to the Chinese and Italian restaurants to eat together and have some soft drinks. Nartey left Italy in 2003 after finishing his Master's degree in Philosophy and went to apply to the Fordham University New York . Since 2003 he was studying there to get his PHD and he got it last year.
