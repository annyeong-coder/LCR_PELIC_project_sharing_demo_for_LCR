Class 3F Teacher ANON_NAME_0 March19 2007 Dear Father Long time no see. How have you been These days I really miss Korean things especially Korean food like Kim chee. You know if I want to keep Kim chee I must buy a refrigerator. I found two advertisements for refrigerators in a magazine. I can't decide between the 399 refrigerator and the 999 refrigerator. The 999 refrigerator has electronic touch temperature control so if the refrigerator needs to lower its temperature it changes by itself because it has a sensor. On the other hand the 399 refrigerator doesn't have a sensor. Also the 999 refrigerator has more space than the 399 refrigerator. However the 399 refrigerator is cheaper and costs less to operate than the 999 refrigerator. I wish I could buy the 999. However I don't have enough money to buy it. I decided that I'll buy the 399 refrigerator. If I buy a refrigerator could you please send me some Kim chee Before sending Kim chee please call me please. My phone number is 412 555 5555. Thanks Father. Love Your son.
