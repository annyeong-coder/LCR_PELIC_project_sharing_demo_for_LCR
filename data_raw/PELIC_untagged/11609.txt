Dear Mr. ANON_NAME_0 this is ANON_NAME_1 a student from the ELI English Language Institute in Pittsburgh. I really appreciate your presentation this past Friday because I didn't know that I had this great opportunity to access the library also through the Internet. For me your presentation was not only a key to improve my English in writing and reading but also a key to build up my knowledge in a lot of fields. For example while I was working on an assignment I found a lot of interesting documents related to my field of study that is Electronic Engineering. Thank you so much for your availability. Sincerely ANON_NAME_2 Last Name
