Ladies and Gentlemen my name is Yumi. I choose five items for put in a time capsule. First some books. These are best selling books of 2012. I'd like you to come to know our favorite books. I'm reading one of these books. I'm enjoying it! Second many seeds. These are very popular flowers and vegetables. When I was a child I would sow these seeds. I'd like you to try it.
