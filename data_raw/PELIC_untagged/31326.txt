Do you have a friend How can we define the person who is a friend. In my opinion A friend is the person who can hang out with me anytime and anywhere. And It means that A friend in need is A friend in deed. We can have great fun with friends who have similar hobby. Friends usually play games and sports which we can do it together. It doesn't matter whose friendship is stronger than other.
