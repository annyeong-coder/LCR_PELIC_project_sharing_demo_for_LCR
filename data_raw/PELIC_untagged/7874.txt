Hi I'm Name I've been living in Pittsburgh since 2006. I was born in 1983. My hobbies are reading running and dancing. When I was 7 years old I started dancing. I decided to be a proffesional dancer when I was 15 years old. Since then I've been performing like a proffesional dancer over the world. I've won 8 contest with my Paraguayan's dance style. In july I broke my arm while I was practicing my dance so I haven't danced since then. Finally I chose Facebook to find some virtual dances community to enjoy dancing from internet!
