Coming to Pittsburgh in the United States meant many changes in my life. Before I came here I quit my job and left my friends and my family. I started to live with my husband and this change brought the results which I couldn't anticipate especially during weekends. On Friday and Sunday I have similar activities. However I have different living routines too. I want to explain my life on Friday and Sunday. Basically I spend my time with my husband on Friday and Sunday. We are watching TV or movies at home. We love Modern Family CSI series and Korean TV shows. On Friday night we are sitting on our couch and eating popcorn while watching these dramas. On Sunday we are also watching Korean TV shows. In this time we relieve ourselves and feel comfortable. We have delicious dinner on both days because we want to celebrate the end of week on Friday and give energy for next week on Sunday. Despite similarities of two days we have a little different activity. Every Friday I have evening English class which is almost finished at 8 pm. Because of this class our free time starts after 8 pm. I am a little busy because I volunteer every Saturday. I should prepare my volunteering on Friday. Sometimes I don't have free time if I have to do a lot of things. However I really try to keep my free time on Sunday. This is my basic philosophy for my life. Friday and Sunday are precious gift to me. I want to enjoy my weekend and spend my time meaningfully. To me it means that I spend time with my husband and do my best on my class and volunteer. Everything is important to me in my life.
