My ELI writing teacher Melissa is very attractive and smart. She always takes good care of her appearance. But it is impossible to avoid that embarrassed situation. Therefore if Melissa had a piece of lettuce stuck in between her teeth while talking to a handsome man that she likes she would put her left hand to cover her mouth and use her tong to move the lettuce out of her teeth at the same time then drink water.
