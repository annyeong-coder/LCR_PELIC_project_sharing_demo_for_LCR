For me the most important relationship was my relationship with my husband . We met at Zawia Teaching Hospital on 2003 when he was working as Orthopedic surgent at ER and I was 4th year medical student after 4 month we get engaged . During that period he was teaching me how to exam the patients and how to take full histories from them how to deal with truma patient . At the same time we was getting to know each other until we got marriad on Augest 2006 and then having the most bueatiful baby boy on 2008. We still together thank God sharring every thing together bad and good moment forever.
