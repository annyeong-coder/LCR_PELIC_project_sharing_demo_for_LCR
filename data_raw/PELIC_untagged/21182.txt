Three years ago when arriving at the U. S. I felt I was a stranger as well as a foolish woman. Not understanding any English word I often returned back a smile instead of a right response when a native speaker talked to me. I also couldn't read owing to my miserable basic vocabulary. Usually there were one thirds words that I didn't know and the other one thirds words I was not sure in a sentence. Furthermore I couldn't make a sentence not only being miserable in my vocabulary but also being poor in my grammar. After having studied English I have achieved my first goal that is to write essay and read newspaper and novel. Though I have made lots of mistakes in my writing and the lack of vocabulary is still an obstacle affecting my reading I have really made a conspicuous progress. Being weak in speaking and listening my next goal will focus on them. Before coming Pitt I told my English teacher working at University of South Dakota that I will call him in someday if I am confident in my English listening and speaking. I hope I can fulfill it soon.
