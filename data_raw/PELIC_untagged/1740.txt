I wrote a topic about relieving stress. This topic is very important to everyone because nobody feel relaxed all the time. I mean we have we have to find an outlet to this problem. In my topic I wrote about various ways of relieving stress and I evaluated it based in two criteria. In the first criterion I discussed the overall organization of my topic. In my writing in general I have to start my topic by introduction. I usually state on it definition reasons of writing the topic and the thesis statement to make a brief introduction of what I'm going to write about. In the main body I wrote about my topic but in more details. For example I started the second paragraph with a topic statement followed by more explanations and examples. I wrote the causes that make people stress because if you have a problem you have first to know what the causes to create a solutions. Also I support my idea with one resource followed by examples. In the third paragraph I mentioned to the ways that make you get away from stress and those ways are very effective. Also I give one support evidence form a magazine which is discover health .
