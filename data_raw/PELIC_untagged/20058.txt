I would like to review the movie named Transformer. Transformer directed by Michael Bay is a story about robot and human. This movie based on the Hasbro toys released in 2007. This movie represents the fighting between heroic robots and evil ones. It stars Shia LaBeouf as Sam Witwicky involved in war of robot. All robots stared in the movie can transform to be everyday machinery. It also shows relationship between human and robot owned by teenager. I like this movie because it makes me think about my childhood when I like to play robot toys. It also indicates that the good must beat the bad. It is not too late to watch this movie and also watch the series of it name Transformers Revenge of the Fallen
