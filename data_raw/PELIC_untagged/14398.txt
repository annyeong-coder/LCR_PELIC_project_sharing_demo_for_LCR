I am spending my vacation at the Elephant Rock Beach which is so wonderful. First of all I am staying in a modern hotel which is located close to the Elephant Rock Beach. I can see a spectacular view of the Elephant Rock Beach from my room. When it is windy I can see huge wave breaks. In addition it has extremely clean and turquoise seawater. Moreover there is the wide sandy coast at the Elephant Rock Beach. While I take a walk at the beach I enjoy collecting colorful sea shells. It is also very quiet and rarely crowded. Most importantly it is rocky and this is the reason that it is called as Elephant Rock Beach. The Elephant Rock Beach is like a paradise. I won't forget this vacation at the Elephant Rock Beach for a long time.
