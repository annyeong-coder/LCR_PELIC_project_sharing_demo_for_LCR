I can swim but I was able to swim after learned swim. So I found teacher about swim and I learned to swim. I didn't like swim. It was likely fly in the sky so I was fearful that swimming. However my swim teacher gave me courage. After two weeks I had fun about swim. Since then I think swim is wonderful and I learned swim too quickly. Now I like swim and I'm a good swimmer.
