In my opinion it's an effective advertisement because it has some characteristics of good ads. Also I think it's an intelligent ad for it makes people think when you see it first time. In other words in order to understand it you have to think it intellectually. I believe you'll smile and feel it is interesting after you got the idea. There are several successful characteristics of this ad. Characteristic 1 use a great illustration stopping power This ad uses an unusual photo to make readers stop notice and read it. In this ad there are many taxies together at the same time and I believe this hardly seeing scene will cause readers' attention to stop and watch it. Characteristic 2 use a borrowed interest photo There is no connection between cars and vodka actually. However the ad shaped cars into a wine bottle. It tries to make a connection between cars and vodka. Characteristic 3 use a short headline and make one clear point The headline of this ad is ABSOLUT CITRON. For a good ad shorter is better. Otherwise the ad used the heading to give the most important message of the product. That is it showed both the color and favor of this new product. It tells customers it's really new . Therefore I think a good illustration with stopping power using a borrowed interest photo to make readers impressed and using a short headline and make one clear point these characteristics make this ad effectively and successfully.
