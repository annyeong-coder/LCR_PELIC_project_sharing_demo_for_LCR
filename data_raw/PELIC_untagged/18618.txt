I still remember the time when I was in first year of school. My elementary school which was far away from home was the best school that I have studied at. It was a small convenient school whose principle was a tough man. He always yelled at students who came late to school. I was lucky I sometimes came late but he didn't shout at me because my aunt with whom I went to School was a teacher there. In fact I will never forget this place where I spent most of my childhood life.
