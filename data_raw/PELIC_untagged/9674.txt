The worst meal experience I've ever had happened seven years ago. I had traveling to Thailand for a week. We went to a restaurant which was near the beach. The view of the restaurant was quite well but there was many flies flew in the air. Then we sit down and ordered some food. When the food came no one wanted to pick up their chopsticks and started eating because the dishes looked very dirty and the food looked gross and awful. Most of the dishes were burned. The rice was not cooked enough. And the flies sometimes landed on the food. The only food which was edible was too hot for us. Finally we stood up left the money on the table and left.
