I am a thinker. According to the reading part thinkers are those who tend to make decisions objectively on the basis of logic. I make decisions based on logic every time. When I have to make decision I set the priority to decide which is more important or more efficient. If there are situation which is complicated and difficult I always try to anticipate all possible results of my decisions. For instance if I have to decide to go school or not I start to think all possibilities. First if I go to school today I can learn English more. Second if I go to school today I can meet friends and teachers and maybe I can be more friendly with them etc. Then I start to think other decisions and results of them. If I do not go to school where I supposed to go every day I can take a rest to refresh my mind but I can refresh my mind on Wednesday. If I go to school at 3rd class I can sleep more in the morning and it might helpful to focus on rest of classes. If I go at lunch time I can take the Nanotechnology class that I am sitting in on and even I can eat my lunch which I usually skip. After all I set the priority. I think going to school has better results than any other decisions so I go to school. It probably depends on situation which include my body condition my stuff I have to do etc. Therefore I am a thinker.
