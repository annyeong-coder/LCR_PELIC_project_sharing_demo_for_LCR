Dear Mr. ANON_NAME_0 I am a student at the EFL Computer Training Institute. My classes are very good but the Institute had better make some improvements or many students are going to leave. Excuse me for my advices but I think you should clean the classroom and you should empty the trash. After you should repair the ceiling you ought to paint the wall and you should change the window. I think if you make this many students aren't going to leave and maybe another students are coming to EFL. Maybe you had better repair the photocopier and you had better buy new computers. Because the student shouldn't wait in the classroom that another student finish to use the computer. Finally I think the students shouldn't eat and drink in the classroom because this is very dirty and they can damage the computers. Thank you for read my letter. ANON_NAME_1.
