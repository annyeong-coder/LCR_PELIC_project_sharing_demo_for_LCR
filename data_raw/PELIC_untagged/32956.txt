While I was staying home yesterday I helped my host cook dinner. After that I took care of the baby. I fed her dinner while my host took the big kids to play soccer. And then I played with the baby in the backyard. The baby's name is Maayan. She is 15 months old. Now she is learning to talk and walk. After they came back from soccer we had dinner together. The dinner was delicious and everyone loved it. I took a shower after I had dinner and then I did my homework. I turned the light on when I was doing my homework. I finished my homework at 10 30pm. I read a book and checked my email. Everyday before I go to bed I call my mom. When we talked last night she was reading a newspaper. We talked for about 15 minutes and then I went to sleep.
