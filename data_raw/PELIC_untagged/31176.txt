I'm going to talk about what other things could people do if they want to have a long live. In my prespective I think live more or less life this is God decesion. Now I'm going to talk how you could live a helthy life. When people turn to 40 they usually start to think about their helth but this is not correct because trying to take any action in this age usually came harder if they take it when they were child. Childrens have more flexibility than adult and this flexibility will continue with them until they get older. Also if you want to keep yourself in a good helth you have to pursue your helth with your doctor if you have any disease so you could do procative action. Furthermore when ture to 40 you have to avoid strenuous works also you have to keep continue doing more exercise. More exercise keeps your body more helther and more flexible and your muscles manipulate perfectly.
