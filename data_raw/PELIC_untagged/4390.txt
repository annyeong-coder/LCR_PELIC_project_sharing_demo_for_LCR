Writing is for transferring authors' ideas to its readers and good writing should contain a main idea clearly. It must be quite hard to write a good paragraph which consists of good writing but if we follow several steps we can make a good paragraph. First of all a paragraph should have a main idea which is made up by the topic sentence. When we want to write a good topic sentence it should contain the subject and its controlling idea and it is usually placed at the first or at the second sentence of the paragraph. Second the other sentences which make up the body of the paragraph should support the topic sentence by way of explaining or defining it. Also using appropriate transition words between sentences can make a good paragraph logical. Lastly at the end of the paragraph the concluding sentence which contains the main idea in different words can be very helpful by bringing to close of it. Therefore writing a good topic sentence and its supporting sentence with proper transition words as well as with a good concluding sentence will provide a good paragraph for the readers.
