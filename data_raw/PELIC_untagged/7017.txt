There might be something good in the future. First maybe I'll have a car but I may not have enough money within three years. But I am not going to lend any money with my father. Except I expect I'll have a family with my boyfriend. Maybe I will have two children. I don't think I might be a good wife but I will be a good mother. After that I hope I will find a good job in my country of Taiwan. I may be a sales engineer. I could be a good purchase because I am interested to negotiate price with vendor. That will take place in the near future.
