Before I came to Pittsburgh I had never imagined cooking at home. I had been studying at medical school and had been working at the hospital for 12 years. I was always busy at that time. So I didn't have time to cook. I used to eat in a restaurant or buy some made food. Otherwise I ate my mother's dish. She has always cooked in her house and her foods are delicious and good for health. Though I can cook food by myself now I miss her food.
