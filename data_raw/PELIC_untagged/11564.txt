Tae Jun how my best childhood friend we met everyday. I remember that we were playing house at a playground. The playground where there wewe a lot of interesting things. I remember one winter when we hunted a sparrow at the place it was fantastic to us. 2 Years ago I went to the playground. I loved my friend whom there were no my best childhood friend but the playground whose the beautiful place was still fantastic to me.
