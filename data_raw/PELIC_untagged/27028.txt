I'm traveling the exact route Steinbeck took 50 falls ago when he and his poodle Charley drove in his pickup truck camper from Sag Harbor on the tip of Long Island to Maine Chicago Seattle Northern California and back to New York. You can read the exciting gruesome details of the first leg of my adventure in my PG blog Travels Without Charley. Because as a travel writer his action's still happening. But the action of Steinbeck and his dog already finished in the past.
