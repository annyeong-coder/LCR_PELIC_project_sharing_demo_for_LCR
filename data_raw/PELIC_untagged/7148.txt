Topic Things that affect what I buy This is some things that affect what I buy. The first example is if I want to buy a pair of shoes. First of all I must think about is the quality of the shoe's function. Second I also consider is practical. If I have to go to run I will buy it. If the shoes are just beautiful I don't have to buy. After that these shoes have to be flexible. I hope the shoes that would have running and walking. Then the most important is the shoes' appearance. I can wear these shoes with short pains and long pains. Make sure the color of the shoes to match my pains. The second example is the products for the face. After I came to Pittsburgh my washable cleansing was exhaustible for almost a month. I wanted to buy a new one. The first thing is I asked my friend. World of month is the best way to find a good product. My friend gave me some good tips on good products in the United States. Then I compare Kiehl's with L'occitane. I found that the L'occitane product is just suitable for body. On the other hand the Kiehl's product is useful face. To me the Kiehl's product also have pretty low price. First time I went to this store with my friend. I looked the store was very carefully. The store is full of fragrance. Businesses decorate the store around the store. From my own feeling it is worth to shop in here. The house of the mood is very comfortable. Even I don't want to buy anything. I like to go around this store. Finally I know that most women enjoy shopping. If I like this product I would say it is an absolute necessity in my life.
