One of the key persons in my life was my teacher in my high school. I was not interested in studying and I couldn't adapt school life. Without his help I wouldn't have graduated high school. He was always concerned about me. Also he suggested that I am interested in school. In Korea school demanded that students stay at school until 10 PM to study. But I didn't want to stay such a long time because I liked baseball so much I wanted to go to baseball park instead of studying in school. Many teachers always scolded me and they didn't want me to go outside without staying at school. However he never scold me about baseball because he thought that were he me he would give the school up. One year later I tried to adapt school and I started to study hard instead of watching the baseball and play with my friends. He always took care of me so I was very happy otherwise I wouldn't go to school any more. Finally I could complete high school without any problem and I could go to the university. Had I not met him I would not do anything in my teenage. I don't want to think about that situation. So I really appreciate his help.
