Today I have listened a part of ANON_NAME_0 Sands's presentation. What she talked is about two methods of minimizing verbal conflict. First she mentioned that a third method is really an efficient way of reducing verbal conflict. It was meaningful that people should speak about themselves instead of about other people. Then what she warned was not returning anger for anger. That two sisters' dispute of their mother's heritage was a seemly example she gave. What the two sisters Rosa and Alicia argued was how to divide the family estate. Rosa said Alicia always pot everything for she was mother's favourite. That Alicia's response of criticizing Rosa's selfishness was not suitable. What the first thing Alicia could have said was told her sister that she felt hurt for those words. The second thing was she could say I felt disrespected.
