Attention Can I have your attention everyone! Freedom He was deprived of his freedom. Distract Their chatter distracts me from studying. Instant The medicine took instant effect. Laugh He laughed a long. Leave I leave Korea next week. Normal His life was normal. Shoot If I am producer I will shoot a film. Told He told me he sent it down weeks ago. Pay attention I often don't pay attention in the class.
