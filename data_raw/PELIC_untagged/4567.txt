The beauty has to be told Jeddah which is the most beautiful city in my country is located in the western region of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. It is considered as the second biggest city in the Kingdom by population and as industrialization city located beside the Red Sea. It is tremendous for different reason. First of all because it is located near the Red Sea it is the route of all Western country like USA to Eastern country like China and vice versa. In addition to that the Red Sea has a beautiful beach which has a variety of unique coral reef and a wonderful plunge beaches. Seeing the beach break during the sunset beside sun disk going down is wonderful especially in summer time. Relaxing and having fun during summer time in beach cabin especially near the Red Sea is considered like Puerto Rico the piece of Haven which is located in the Atlantic Ocean. This information was studied by the Saudi Chamber of Commerce as the tourists are excited during they stay in Jeddah. In addition to their beautiful comment neither them nor us as townspeople we can not explain how exciting Jeddah is unless you see it by your eyes and feel the beautiful experience.
