When I was young I lived withe my grand parent who has lived in country because my mother who was a teacher was busy. My grand parent's house that was a big and old had a garden. I used to spent my time in there. At that time I raised a cat that was cute. However the cat which scratched my face was sent neighbor. I loved the cat but my grand mother who didn't like the cat because she scratched me didn't allow me to raise that.
