Television is one of the new kinds of entertainment that most of people like. When I was a little child there was few kind of programs in the television. First before there just were movies and news but now there are a lot of new kinds of programs on the television. Second many people now are spending much of their time watching TV but they do not get bored because programs are interesting and nice. Finally I think people should not watch TV a lot because that is going to affect their life in many ways such as their work and their health.
