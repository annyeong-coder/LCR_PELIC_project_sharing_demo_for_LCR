I met my girlfriend Hannah while she was a Peace Corps volunteer in Samoa my home country. She moved into my village for her culture and language training and that is where I met her. When I first saw Hannah I thought she was so beautiful. One night while I was doing my homework behind my house she walked over to me and said hi! She is so important to me because she supports me encourages me and loves me all the time. Besides the day we met the most important day of our relationship was the day I left Samoa to come to the United States to be with her. We moved here in Pittsburgh to start our future together.
