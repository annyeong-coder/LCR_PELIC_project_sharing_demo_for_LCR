Baoxia Cheng Grammar 3G 2 20 12 Time Capsule 2009 May 23 2009 was a special day for me I created a time capsule and buried it under a huge stone in my backyard. There were six significant items in the capsule which will tell people something about my current situations. For example I put many nice individual pictures inside to tell people how I look like. If someone opens it 200 years from now then they can see how much we look similar or how much we look different. The second item that I put inside was a great deal of jewelry. I wanted to give some benefits to my future generations and maybe the jewelry will assist them to pass a hard time in their life. After that I put several bottles of wine in the capsule which was an appropriate way to show my love to my children. I hope they can drink this special wine in their wedding. Also I put a few nursing uniforms inside to show my work experiences then people should remember that I was a good nurse and help a lot of patients in my life. The fifth item was two notebooks about my study in ELI. That was a significant method to show the best study memories in my life. My blue little iPod was the last item that I put in the capsule which will show a lot of fantastic songs to someone who finds it then they will enjoy a great deal of music. I like my special time capsule maybe there was a little challenge for people to find it but once you get it it will give you a lot of surprises!
