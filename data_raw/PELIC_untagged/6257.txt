People often say that humans cannot ever live alone. Even though some people like to be alone to get energy or an inspiration. So among those personality categories introvert fits me. I am a person who prefers to listen rather than talk. Of course there is a time when I want to talk for a while but mostly I tend to be a listener. For example at some discussions which I have had when I was going to the university most of time I was listening except when I was strongly disagree with someone whose idea did not make sense at all or showed a ridiculous stereotype. In addition I get many inspirations when I am alone. My room is the place where I can concentrate effectively and most of my favorite things to do take place in my room. My hobbies an example of which is reading a book can be done alone. However interestingly I have many friends most of whom are extroverts. Even I could feel their inclinations that surprise me. The friend whom I met in university freshman is a typical type of extrovert. There was a time when we had a meeting with other university students who never had met before. He and I were both first time like that meeting but he acted like old friends with them. Supposedly their outgoing energy and my introversive tendency seem offset each other. So as I wrote above this is the reason that people live together balancing.
