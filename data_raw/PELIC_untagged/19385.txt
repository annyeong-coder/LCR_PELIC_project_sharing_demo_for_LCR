I met my husband when I was a college student. He was my classmate. We first talked each other when we were taking a small trip to see fireflies in Summer. I was getting close with him though at first he was just one of my friends. I think we have totally opposite characters but we have a similar sense of value. I had a quarrel with him many times. But luckily we got married after we graduated from college.
