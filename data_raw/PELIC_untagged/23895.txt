A friend in need is a friend indeed. A friend in need is a person whose effort is helping you when you need help. For example if you have a problem and you got help from your friend then your friend who is help you and solve your problem is a friend indeed. Also when you need something that your friend has it and your friend give it to you then your friend is a friend indeed. When I lose something which is important for me and I feel sad about it my friend who is a friend indeed support me and encourage me to pass this situation.
