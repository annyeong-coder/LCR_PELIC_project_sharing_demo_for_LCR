Methods of education The different of education methods comes the different type of people. And how do they been raised by their families. The most essential tool that would judge over methods is the result of this method among its own society community and culture. Also the development of these methods will play a role. The education methods here in the US and back in home country Saudi Arabia are a good example for that. One of the most essential tools for any education methods is the flexibility of developing this method. In my country I can see that it's hard to change anything in the education curriculums. Even though that any sciences the human been discovered is developing every time. In other hand here in the US it's obvious that the education curriculum is being developed from time to time to fit in the needs of the life. In my country unfortunately any change would take time to be submitted We can judge any education method from what it gave to its own society. I can see that the different method of education between in the US and the kingdom has led these two nations into a huge gap between both of them. And it's not hard to tell which one of them are the most successful. Although there is a huge gap between these two nations but we can't deny the big development in country that doesn't lasted the half age of a country like United States of America. So it's better to wait before giving a final overall judgment to the method of education in a developing nation like Saudi Arabia. It's important to any nation seeking its own development to catch the ride toward the industrial country. By developing itself and the education system. Otherwise it will stay without any development and thus will lead to the disappearing of this culture between the great nations.
