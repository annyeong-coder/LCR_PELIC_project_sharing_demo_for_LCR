I could a lot of things in this semester. First of all I could make my own target. Until last term I studied English but I didn't have my vivid purpose why I have to study English. I just studied English because someday it might be helpful to me. However I made my own target in this term and I'll make effort to persist my English even if I go back my country. Another thing that I could achieve this term is to improve my reading ability. Before I struggled when I read article or novel in English. Also I'm always reluctant to read somethings were written English. However I don't hesitate to read anything in English any more. Furthermore I started to read English novel and I'm really engrossed with them. I'm happy that I could achieve many things in this term and I'll work hard to maintain my English!
