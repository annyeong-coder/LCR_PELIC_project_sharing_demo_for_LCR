Apple Company has new product that is I pad. People are think that is product killer because Amazon has one product that is Kindle. Kindle and I pad can do in the same thing so People who use I Pad can play web page or check e mail but Kindle can read only PDF file. However Kindle and I pad have different target group because Kindle easy to use and carry but I pad is heavy and like computer and can down load application that some company make money from but does not good for people want to type on it and two company try to connect soft ware and hard ware together because it is business all of which can make money to the Company.
