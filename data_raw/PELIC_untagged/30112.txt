That I needed the TOEFL score was obvious to get an admission of University of Pitt. What I can do is that just study. TOEFL test which evaluates the English language skills that have 4 sections like reading listening speaking and writing needs some knowhow and time to prepare. At my first time I didn't get a high score that the university requires over 80 points. I didn't know that how I have to study. Actually I didn't make any strategy whether the test was difficult. I asked to my friend who got the score over 100 points what he did to get that score. He made a guideline to me what I have to do and the first thing was to memorize many vocabularies. I followed his recommendations and I always brought a word list whether I went to the restroom. That the second thing I have to do was that I needed to practice a note taking. Whether I could catch whole sentence in the lecture I tried to summarize and write down on the paper. Finally I made a good score what I really needed. That I recognized was that practice is the best strategy.
