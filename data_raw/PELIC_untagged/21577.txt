Richard Fuller and his colleagues investigated why some robins living near urban areas sing at night. Fuller's research team had a two year study to find out why. They measured light and noise levels at 121 sites. They discovered it was noisier in places where robins sang at night. On the other hand they discovered that light pollution had less effect than people had theorized.
