There are many animals which killed by human because of laboratory experiments. The justice of the killing of animals for experiments has been a controversial problem. Whereas some people insist that it's too cruel other people say that it's inevitable to keep our lives. In my opinion the use of animals for laboratory experiments is another kind of using animals. Mankind has been used many animals in a diverse ways. First for example dogs were tamed to guard human's property and cattle were fostered to provide human with the milk and meat. For animals it's not lucky for them because they lose their freedom. Secondly we are using many kinds of products based on the parts of animals. For instance we make our clothing with the leather of cows crocodiles or pigs. Even we use the fur of rabbits or minks. The people who agree to use these kinds of products aren't eligible to say Don't kill animals in laboratory! Lastly we already have used animal's organs or useful hormones like insulin to cure our disease. According to the Internet resources transplanting human's liver with pig's liver will be prevalent in couple years. We can't use organ which is come from dead animals we have to kill them. Extracting hormones from animals is also just torture to them but how many people insist we shouldn't able to kill them We can't persist our lives without using animals. However the animasl also have the right to persist their lives. In conclusion the most important task we have to carry out is setting a limitation to prohibit killing animals more than enough. For instance we can choose elder and fit mouse instead of young and weak mouse to sue. If we regulate the frequency of killing animals properly the problem will be solved we can use animals their lives can be more secure.
