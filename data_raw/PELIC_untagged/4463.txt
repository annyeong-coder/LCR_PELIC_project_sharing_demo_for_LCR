What a Memorial Day Yesterday was 2007 Memorial Day and it was my first time experiencing this day in the USA. Therefore I was curious about it and I searched the internet to get more on it. I noticed that the Memorial Day was started after the Americans civil war. The main objective of this day was to remember the victims of the civil war. Later on it was changed by time to remember the American victims in all wars such as World War I and II. Therefore it was to console and heal the Americans after they fight with each other. Nowadays the news is gloomy and Americans are killed in different kind of war.
