I think Martin's claim is more convincing than Nickell's for me. I believe that some people have the psychic abilities. It is a fact that Martin could find the victim and make the prediction about when the suspect would be caught although we could not explain how she could so. Some people might say she was lucky however I think she must be able to feel something so that she can predict it correctly. Vocab. 1. Multitude n. A very large number of people or things 2.
