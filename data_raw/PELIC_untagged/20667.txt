After I graduated from the high school my dad wanted me to go to a medicen shool. He made it as an inevitable to me. He believed it is my destiny to be a doctor as my old brother. My dad would find a way to manipulate me to be a doctor. But I had fixed on my dicision to go to an architecture shool. I ascribed my choice to my iteresting in art and math. Here I am now I am an architect. After I violated my dads plans for me I was always thinking did I abitrary decided to be an engineer the answer is NO.
