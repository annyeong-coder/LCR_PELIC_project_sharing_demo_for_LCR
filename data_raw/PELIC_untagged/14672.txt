The decision affect my life the most was going to the United States after millitary service. I would not have been here if I hadn't made that decision. Despite carefully planniing and thinking I made that rush thoughtless decision. To tell the truth the result was not that bad and I'm eager to pursue my gratuated study right now but I still wish I could have spent more time planning my oversea studying. I'm the kind of person spending a lot of time worrying and hesitating. I really wish I could have more time to arrange my schedule. Only my applications for graduated schools goes find all the hard works would be worthwhile.
