The Food Guide Pyramid makes us eat right and healthier every day and it teaches us how to choose the nutrients which we need from various foods. The past Food Guide Pyramid indicates that the foods we eat used to be classified to six groups the Grain Group Vegetable Group Fruit Group Milk Group Meat Group and Fats Group. If we compare the past Food Guide Pyramid in our textbook with the latest one in the website we will find out there are some different features between these two versions. For instance the latest version adds physical activity which simply means movement of the body that uses energy but past version didn't mention that furthermore the latest version divides the foods into six new groups Grain Group Vegetable Group Fruit Group Milk Group Meat and Beans Group and Oils Group. The latest version emphasizes whole grain fat free or low fat foods and lean meat poultry fish etc. And provides more details about vegetable group and fruit group. Especially the new oil group should be low in saturated fats trans fats.
