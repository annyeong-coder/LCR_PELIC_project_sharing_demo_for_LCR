Once upon a time two friends where on their way to another city so the first one whose name is ANON_NAME_0 said to his friend ANON_NAME_1 we have a long time ahead of us until we reach our destination so let us pass time by dreaming . So ANON_NAME_0 started by saying that he dreams to own a big herd of sheep so he could benefit from its milk and meat. Then ANON_NAME_1 said I wish I have a big herd of wolfs to send them to eat your sheep . After that ANON_NAME_0 said Is that who much you respect me ! . So after a very long argument they decided to ask the first person they see on their way to judge who is wrong and who is write. Finally an old man caring a large jar of honey was passing so they stopped him and explained the situation and asked him to be the judge. After they were done explaining the old man held his jar and spelled it on the ground and said May god spell my bold like this honey you are both idiots ! .
