I use the Internet for checking the e mail news and connecting friends in Korea such as massager or community site. When I come back to my home first of all I check my e mail. And than I usually check topic news in Korea and sometimes I looking around internet for the information. Also on count of Internet I can connect my friends in Korea. So although I stay in USA I can know about my homeland. I think I use internet about 1hour each day.
