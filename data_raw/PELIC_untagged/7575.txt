In my opinion that is a good idea that allow teenagers have jobs while they are still students. There are three benefits responsibility gaining money and socialization. Most teenagers who have jobs have high responsibility than others. They have to manage their time for studying at school working doing housework and doing homework to balance in every activity. It's quit difficult for their ages but if they can do that they will have the responsibility to handle other occurrences. Another benefit is gaining money. This may be the most important reason for them to have jobs. Sometimes they want to buy something which they can't afford it with his money that get from their parents. That drives them to find jobs. Moreover some families don't have enough money to afford their kid's school. So some teenagers do jobs for affording their tuition fee. Socialization is the benefit which get from working. They will know a lot of people in their jobs for example one teenager works as a server in a restaurant. She knows her colleagues who are older and younger than her. She also knows some customers which give her some extra money because they like her and give her some part time jobs. Those people may help them in the future if they get some problems. Working makes many befits for teenagers. It makes them have higher responsibility. They can gain some money which reduce the amount of money that their parents have to pay for them. Finally they can socialize with others. So I think that it's a good idea to allow students to work.
