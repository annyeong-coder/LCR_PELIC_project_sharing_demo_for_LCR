I will talk about how to met my friend who called Abdo in the university . I always go to the university early in the morning and I do not like to be late so Abdo always comes to the class late . I met him in cafeteria when I was eating my breakfast. I talked to him about attendance and the doctor was very upset . He listened to my advise . Abdo is my best friend because he is very good guy and he always assists me when I need help . We went to Turkey last summer and it was amazing trip .
