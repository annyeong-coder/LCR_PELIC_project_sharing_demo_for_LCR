In conclusion although many people think that there should not be a rule that some video games can only sell to people over 17 because they think that they have their own right to choose what they play and they don't believe these video games would have negative effect on teenagers and children's behavior. In my opinion people should not violate the rule because most of these games include too much violent and it might affect teenagers and children's lives.
