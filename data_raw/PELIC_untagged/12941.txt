I have been in Pittsburgh for eight month that is mean I have leaved my home country since 2007. I have already rent a room. Then I've already gone to waterfront. I've already shopped at walnut place. And I have not had dinner with teacher Eli yet. I have not read a book yet. I have already writing exam but my exam has not finished yet. I have already registered next team but I have not paid for that yet. However I have planned for taking tofel test in order to inter university in U. S. A.
