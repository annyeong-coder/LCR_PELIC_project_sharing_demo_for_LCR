I met a lot of new friends before I came to Pittsburgh. I had a good friend who was born the same day in the year with me. She was shorter than me whose age was younger than me 3 years. She was kindly and friendly whose name is Miomio. We usually went out and ate delicious food. We talked each other's traveled experiences and played with a lot of friends. We had a camp when the New Year eve in 2008. We wished the New Year coming that everyone will have a nice year. I'm missing her and my friends who were traveled with me.
