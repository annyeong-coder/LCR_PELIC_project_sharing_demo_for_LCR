I live a small street in pittsburgh. It is a absolutely perfect street. The street is quite and neighbor is very politely. My next door neighbor is neat and helpful. She wash the car and sweep the yard every weekend. Because she knows I am chinese she always speak with me so slowly. She is also reliable. She give me her phone nember for emegency phone call. My across door neighbor is very friendly and by easliy. She cooks food beautifully. Sometime she send wonderful cake for my children. Sometime I send beautiful shushi for her children. Think we are already become good friend. I love my neighbor. Our neighbor is lovely each other.
