I should have moved to Pittsburgh together with my family 8 years ago but I might have discussed the problem at that time with my wife. I shouldn't have sold my company's stocks. Also I could have thought again before I sold the stocks. I ought not to have quit my job but I'm just looking for a job and it is so difficult. I ought to have studied English hardly when I was a student. I might have traveled more with my children in my country when they were still young.
