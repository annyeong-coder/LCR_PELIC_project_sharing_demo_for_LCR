I think there are some advantages and disadvantages of teaching young children business skills and strategies. There are some advantages since they get big motivation to learn at school with their clear goal to achieve in the early stage of life. For instance a child whose goal is helping people in poverty may plan to attend a university to study the public health and might establish an organization to solve health problems in developing countries. In addition business skills and strategies they learn would simply help them once they grow up and work in the real business world in the future. On the other hand there are some disadvantages since they are too young to set their goal. Without great cooperation of parents who have thoughtful ideas about their children's future some of children will be easy to go wrong such as aiming at making a big money in a short term ignoring some irrelevant subjects of business to learn at school. In my pinion therefore there are some advantages and disadvantages to teach children business skills and strategies.
