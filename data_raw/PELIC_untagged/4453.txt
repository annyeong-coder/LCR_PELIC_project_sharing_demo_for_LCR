I used to live in Shanghai. In those days I used to stay with my parents. I used to have very short hair. I used to work. I used to wear formal clothes. I used to dance with my friends. I used to play cards with my friends. I used to be very busy. Today I am living in Pittsburgh. I stay with my husband. I wear my long hair. I am studying English. I wear comfortable clothes. I play tennis with my new friends. I am more relaxed.
