When I first come to USA I need to make an appointment in eye clinic. I had difficulty to find out the number. Then when I finally found it I call the clinic . I picked up the phone and called the number and when the receptionist answered me he asked me to hang up. I was waiting for half an hour then I end the call to call back when I finished my classes. When I come back home I did the call again I figure out that the receptionist needed to fill the paper out to give me the date . He wrote my information down then he gave me the date of the appointment . I put the telephone off after a hard times because the difficulty that I had in speaking at the beginning of my study .
