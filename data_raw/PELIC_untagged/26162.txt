We agreed to bring matches a knife and chocolate. Matches can start a fire and also can light up the ground when we walk at night. By using fire we may cook and might prevent mosquitoes or other insects. A knife can hunt animals to eat and also can protect ourselves. It could use to crack coconuts. Chocolate can give us energy. I think it's hard to get sweets in the island so it might be essential nutrition. Although one of my group members said he wanted to bring his girlfriend as an extra item I disagree because I don't need her . I prefer to bring a blanket because it can make me warm and may give me a good sleep.
