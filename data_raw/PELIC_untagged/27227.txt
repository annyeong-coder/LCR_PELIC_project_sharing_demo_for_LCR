The worst meal I have ever had was the Friday's entree in Walnut Grill. It was a kind of sea food pasta which tasted weird. The sauce they put was too acid and sweet. The sea foods it had were shrimp and crab meat which were over cooked and the side was cold vegetable. The noodle in it was hard to chew which was not cooked enough. The salad with the pasta was not fresh. The vegetables in it were looked nearly go bad. The only thing I can enjoy is the beverage which was made from mango and coconut. Such a terrible dinner! From then on I have never gone there anymore because of the miserable experience.
