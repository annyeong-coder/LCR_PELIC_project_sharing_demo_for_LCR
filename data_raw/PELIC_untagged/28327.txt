I live in Squirrel Hill area. It is a quiet area. All the people live in Squirrel Hill are friendly. Ther are many beautiful places in Squirrel Hill. Sometime I meet my Neighbors early. The Neighbors treat me politely. One of my Neighbor sometime play loudly in the weekend. Usually the Neighborhood is quiet. It is very nice Neighborhood to live.
