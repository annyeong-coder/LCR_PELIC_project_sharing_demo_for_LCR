My hometown is Seoul which is capital city of Korea. After I entered elementary school I moved to Bundang where I am living now. Bundang is a new and popular city. However at first time when I moved to Bundang it wasn't good place to live. I remember that Bundang had a lot of construction to build apartment everyday. I used to live in an apartment where there were always a lot of people. I knew many people in apartment because we met almost everyday in a lobby. I remember one of my neighbors whom I often play with. I don't know where she lives now but I miss her.
