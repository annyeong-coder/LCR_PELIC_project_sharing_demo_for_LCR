The author talked about two important relationships that every society has. The first one he mentioned the tie between political power and individual freedom. Political power is a representation of individuals. If the political power is not free it cannot symbolize the free individuals therefore it has no power on the individual and the community. The second tie is the language society and economic. By language is how free individuals from a society interact with each others. The language becomes a symbol of the society. If the society in individuals is not free to use its own language it doesn't give these individuals social freedom. Not having the personal freedom in a society doesn't give it the ability to succeed economically.
