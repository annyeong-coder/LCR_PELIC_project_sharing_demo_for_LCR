I feel great in my new apartment. My wife and I picked it out three months ago. I think it set up many years ago. We looked over the area before we sign up the papers. It shows me up the beautiful backyard When I sit down on the sofa and beside the window. Also I try to straighten the pictures up on the wall to keep the apartment on a good view. I put the TV on the table in front of the sofa to watch the programs in free times. The kitchen let me down because it is small. I figured it out when I took the big table away. Also the kitchen looks big when I turned the refrigerator around.
