There are many writing reference books to show us how to compose significant in English writing such as the writing process steps organization gathering and developing ideas grammatical sentences word choice or mechanics spelling and punctuation. In my point of view every one should have strengths and weakness during writing in English even though a native speaker. I am an ELI student and I have been learning writing in English for a while. I think my strengths are the writing process steps organization and gathering and developing the ideas especial with some of familiar topics such as using computing into education culture things or personal experiences so on. In contrast I do have weaknesses in English writing such us grammatical sentences word choice or mechanics spelling and punctuation. I think the mechanic part as spelling and punctuation might easy if I pay more attention during my writing. But the problems of grammatical and word choice are most difficult for me. Therefore I need to practice more and study hard on my weakness while I am leaning the English writing. At the same time I should keep my strengths during writing in English.
