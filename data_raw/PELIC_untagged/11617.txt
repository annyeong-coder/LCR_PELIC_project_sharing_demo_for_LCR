Dear Mr. ANON_NAME_0 I am writing this e mail to say you thank you so much for the training you had with us the last Friday. I learned a lot from that training. I am student in economics and I have already found two databases on the library web site that contain a lot of articles in economics that are very useful for me. I cannot thank you enough for that training. Sincerely Salif Last Name Student at English Language Institute ELI
