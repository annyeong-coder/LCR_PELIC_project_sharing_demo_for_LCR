I could mention arabian myth is the story of Aldaffa. Aldaffa was considered the most dangerous man who pushes children in a wells. Actually there are many wells which is located throughout Arabian Peninsula. Arabian Peninsula is composed of five countries the most of its space is occupied by Saudi Arabia . Aldaffa was believed by some of the people that he lived in the old wells. So they try to keep their children away from these wells. In addition a children were scared by their parents that Aldaffa will push them in wells if they play around it. Other people did not believe this story. But it was thought by them that Aldaffa is created by one person who want to protect a children from falling in wells. Because Some of these wells were ditched without cover or fence .
