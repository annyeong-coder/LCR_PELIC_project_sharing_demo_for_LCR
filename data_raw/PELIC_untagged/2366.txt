In my free time I like to go shopping and see a movie. I HAVE GONE TO two shopping malls this month and I'll go to another shopping mall tomorrow. I really enjoy shopping especially buying clothes in Pennsylvania for there is no tax charged here. I also like seeing a movie in my free time. I HAVE BEEN SEEING a movie named Somewhere in Time since yesterday night. I'm going to see it after school today. I like this movie so much that I HAVE SEEN this movie twice and this is my third time to see it.
