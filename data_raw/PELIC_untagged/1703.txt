You stop talking and listen attention. My laptop help me to do my homework and check e mail but sometime it distract from me. I enjoy freedom from trip time. I send instant e mail at lunch time. I watched to catoon so I laugh from cartoon. My sister's room is very dirty so I leave the room. I want to speacial life but I live a normal pattern of my life. I can shoot video and take picture to digital of my life. I told my sister to stop watching TV. If you want to hear to my presentation you pay attention.
