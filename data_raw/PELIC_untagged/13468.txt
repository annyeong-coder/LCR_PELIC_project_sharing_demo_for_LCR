The most important person whom I have met in my life is my best friend. She whom I have known for 10 years is Sae Rom. I met her when I was a middle student. I was a transfer student so I was nervous about starting a new school where I didn't know anyone. Then she took right up with me. She and I who enjoyed watching movies liked going to the theater but sometimes could not agree on which movie to see. Also during summer I went with her and her family to their summer house which was located next to sea. We spent most of day swimming. Sae Rom whose personality is free and easy did not like to dress up so she was casually dressed. She moved to Germany in 2005 when we graduated from high school. She who is majoring in German wants to be a diplomat. If I share with someone on whom I depend that person always is Sae Rome. I really hope that our friendship will be steady.
