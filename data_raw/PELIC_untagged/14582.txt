To be honest I should have lots of dilemma things in my life. For example when I come USA just few week. I can't speak English all the time. So sometimes I might not have use English to talk to my friends. My reading teacher Peter often correct me not do this again. I should have use English to communicate with my friend. So Every time he told me cold have speak English. I said I promise to speak English next time. But I am not do that. Although I know it will good for my English. So he often judge me in public place. Make me feel uncomfortable. But it's Ok. It's my fault. I should do that. Now I figure out. Maybe I might have pay more attention in speak. Try my best to use English to talk to other people. Thanks my reading teacher. You give me a good suggestion.
