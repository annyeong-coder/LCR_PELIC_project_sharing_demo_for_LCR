I built this site for Motorcycle fans. I've writing this page to introduce myself. I've always been in love with motorcycles. I grow up in Jeddah KSA and my father loves motorcycles. Also the weather in my city is helping me to ride my motorcycle every day. I've been working on my English for five months. Since I move to The United States of America I've learned how to ski. This month I've already skied ten times. Nothing special in my social life except that last year I got engaged to a beautiful girl. She wants to get married as soon as possible. She never rode a motorcycle before. She want me to show her how to ride a motorcycle and by her a new one. I wish that she will never learn how to ride
