MY PROUDEST MOMENT My proudest moment was when I finished college. First of all it was one of my greatest goals. Second it was the end of my student stage and the beginning of a new stage in my life. Third for me and my family this was a wonderful day. Also the completion of my degree represented the continuation of other goals like beginning a masters program or beginning to work. At the same time finishing college was the final effort in this stage of my life. Finally I consider that finishing school was one of the proudest moments in my life because it was a conclusion of my life as a student.
