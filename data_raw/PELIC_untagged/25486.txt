The Effects of Class Size Reduction Class size reduction program is a movement that reduces the number of students per teacher in a regular classroom. The program which had been conducted by several states since the end of 1980s started nationwide by the Clinton administration in 1999. The purpose of this program is to improve student achievement by reducing class size into 18 20 students per teacher. 10 Years after the program's implementation it is proven that the program has positive effects on both teachers and students. First teachers can get to know each student better and provide more considerate attention. Before this program started more than 30 students were assigned to a teacher. Under this circumstance teachers couldn't afford to take care of each student. However with the ratio decreasing teachers can provide more attention to each student. Perceiving the students deeply and better is important because it is helpful to treat each student in the proper way based on one's attributes. Also it contributes to make a close relationship between teachers and students. If a student feel that he or she is comfortable with the teacher it is easier to tell the teacher about difficulties occurring in the school. Second in terms of instruction optimistic results are considerable. Reducing class size means that teachers can use time more effectively to smaller group of students. According to Halback's research SAGE The Wisconsin Student Achievement Guarantee in Education teachers observed that increased instructional time enables them to delve deeper into subject matter which leads to higher achievement. They also stated that covering the contents in more depth helps students had a better and deeper understanding of concepts. Halback Ehrle Zaihorik Molnar 2001 Positive effects were shown to affect not only teachers but also students. It is considered that positive results mentioned above influenced to students. For example when teachers pay attention to students and spend more time teaching the subjects students are more engaged and show exceptional efforts. Since schools are operated by interaction between teachers and students every phenomenon cannot turn up just one side. And the effects on both sides would contribute one of the ultimate purposes of school to improve student achievement. For the students they are able to have more opportunities to express their opinion as class size reduces. In other words participation is encouraged. Speaking one's opinion is helpful to students since it can bring them up to think logically and encourage them to be self confident. It also means that they can be developed mutually by sharing others' understanding. Although all students in one class listen to the same content their comprehension or reaction might be different from others. In the general classroom opinions of classmates who listen and study the same things are always helpful because sharing others' opinions and trying to understand or dispute those would make students to think more widely. Finally students can get individualized feedback from the teacher in the reduced size class. The teacher can give feedback to everyone because the total amount of time and endeavor is distributed to fewer students that is the teacher can devote more time to assess and improve individuals. Since the teacher also knows each student better and deeper the feedback would be focused to each student. Individualized feedback can help each student to find one's strength and weakness to find a remedy for the problem and to be engaged in learning activities. In conclusion reducing class size has brought several optimistic results to teachers and students. As a result of it the ultimate goal of this movement which was to improve achievement has been accomplished. Therefore reduction class size is effective in spite of the large investment of funds and time which were devoted to this program. However reduction cannot solve most of problems ultimately. For the cumulative effects of it additional time and experience are needed of course. However more important thing is the self improvement of teachers. Teacher must teach in various ways to reap the benefits of class size reduction. When it keeps continuously the optimistic effects of the program will be maximized. Reference Halback. A. Ehrle. K.
