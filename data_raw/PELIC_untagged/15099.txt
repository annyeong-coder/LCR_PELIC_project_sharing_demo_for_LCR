I have been studying English since I came to the United States. At first I felt it will be boring to study English for long time. Then I have changed my mind. I have learned many new skills that helped me a lot during my stay in the United States. I have been trying to use the structure that I have learned in the grammar class to communicate with my friends and classmates. I am so excited to learn more because I got good grades in all the quizzes that I had last month.
