I think the author mean by ties for social and economic mechanisms which in every society underpin relations between culture and communities. I think the author wants us to pay attention for the individual freedom and the political power between the linguistic. For example every one has his or her opinion for what I want to study between the linguistic and that also depends on me if I'd like to study another language or not. Like some counties let their people study another language as condition for school system. I think that is bad habit because that is considered like force to do something that you don't like to against the freedom. However the other side here is for political power and also is an important between people and groups and between culture and communities. So if someone wants to do business and his or her business probably need another language than his or her language so in this condition is necessary to work on that and also to let your business existing.
