The tensest experience with money that I have had was in 2002 in the Buenos Aires airport when I was going back to Chile. I had been attending a theater festival during a whole week and I had spent most of my money in the tickets so for the last day I had just the money for the taxi to the airport and a couple of dollars for lunch before the flight. When I got at the airline counter the attendant told me You should go to next counter and pay 12 dollars of taxes before you check in. I almost died the money left for lunch wasn't enough and I was almost crying when I remembered I had put a few coins in the pocket of a pants. I unmade my suitcase quickly until I found my pants and I could pay the taxes but I felt hungry for a long time.
