Metal arbours are another option. Lighter and airier than wood they create a romantic effect at all times of the year. Self assembly ones are available although they can be expensive or you could employ a builder with metalworking experience to make a custom built arbour out of reinforcing bar known in the trade as rebar. This is the very heavy twisted metal rod that is used to reinforce concrete builders' merchants such as Jewson sell it cut to length.
