What have you done I have lived in Pittsburgh for 4 months. I have studied in the ELI since last September. I have met lots of my friend in Saudi Arabia in Pittsburgh. I have been preparing for IELTS test since January and I study every day to be ready for the exam. I have been in Washington and I like streets and hotels there. I have lived with host family for one month. Yesterday I bought a new car and I can't drive it. I have been driving for 8 years in fine weather but now I can't drive because the snow weather. I like playing soccer so I have been playing 4 times in this month. I have drunk 2 cups of tea tonight and I think I need more for studing.
