My neglect brought lots of problems. It happened when I worked for a company in my country. I usually went to the company by walk and it took only 10 minutes. One day I woke up late so I took a taxi and told the driver my destination. The driver gave me a pitiful glance and said that I should had been diligent. I was so shy and my face turned red. But a couple of problems followed it. When I arrived in front of my office I realized that I didn't bring any money. Oh my god! My face turned red again. I begged the driver to wait a little bit so that I could bring money from my office. I run into the office but most of the colleagues were in the meeting. I should have asked a executive who was not in the meeting to borrow me 1 000won 1 dollar in the US . I was so ashamed of the situation.
