B Okay I will try to give you some advices and I hope to help you. Mr. F Okay I am listening to you. B first you should write it in a piece of paper. Then you ought to write it twice or three times so you can remember it when you need it. Also you should review it every day or when you have a free time. Mr. F that is a great idea but I have a lot of homework every day and I do not have a free time. B okay you could review it while you study.
