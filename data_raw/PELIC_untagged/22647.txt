As we all know many kinds of trees' growth is pretty slow. Aren't they vital in the world Certainly they are. I have been thinking that the problems in the world that have been being talked for long. The same sounds from everywhere which can be done by everyone! Everyone is able to speak. Global warming melting of glaciers in the poles bla bla bla. This is not what we need. From my perspective the best thing that has been problem is not plating more and more trees. As I said it takes long time. The Peoples are consuming too many trees all over the world due to the industrialization where people are manufacturing like a crazy. Papers furnitures etc. So Obviously trees are indispensable for our life. Then we should plant more and more. I have created a slogan for that. DON'T STOP PLANTING I WANT MOOOOORE TREES ON MY STREET!!!
