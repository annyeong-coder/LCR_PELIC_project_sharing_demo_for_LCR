Learning a second language is beneficial to you. For example when you would like to come up to any place in the world you hope to speak their language. On the other hand when you would like learning the second language you'll see several mistakes. I can categorize the mistakes when you learn second language difficult accent different grammar and meaning of word. First of all people usually Facing problems such as an accent I mean when you learn any language your accent will not able to understand what they say and they can't understand what do you say because you learn traditional language not the same the language that people speak in the country. It is similar but not the same. So that is one mistake I think anyone studies second language will facing accent problem. Second a grammar is superior in any language and it's often different from others grammars. Such as some grammars in some languages have object and other languages don't have this. It's making a lot of mistakes for some people mistake when they speak because they wont to specific grammar and they are studying different grammar that makes them a lot of problems when they speak also. Third actuality in the some languages words have different meaning. Maybe good words or bad words. For example if you say the word using different accent maybe anyone who has native language hears it as a bad word. On the other hand some words have different meaning in a sentence if the words come first the sentence in the middle or in the end. So if someone heard what did you say probability he couldn't understand what do you mean so it's a big mistake in my opinion. In conclusion have you ever tried to learning second language If yes which the mistakes are made problems to you then make comparison between what I said and what are the mistakes do you have. If your answer is no I suggest you to be careful from two things grammar and meaning of word. They are more necessary than other things in the language.
