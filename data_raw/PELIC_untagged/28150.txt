Since I was a kid I always like to do activities which need a company. I am a kind of person who is easy going and It's easy for me to make new freinds . But even though I always like to be in touch with my old best freinds because they know well since we were kids and they understand my feelings. Some times when I have free time I like to hang out with my freinds who we have some things in common such as dancing hobby or designing websites . When I meet acquaintance who I know a little information about I say Hi and sometimes I have a little short conversation with them.
