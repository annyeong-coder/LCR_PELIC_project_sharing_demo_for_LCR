Hi Tariq How are you doing I have some advice for you before you come here. You should bring your entire certificates and should translate all them into English Language. If you can read about American culture please do it because this way will make the new culture and its people somewhat familiar for you when you arrive. Also you should be aware of differences between the two countries. You should bring your computer and some clothes because everything here is expensive. You had better e mail universities to know the conditions of acceptance and you should be prepared for these conditions. Before going to the American Embassy you should fill out some forms that are on their web site. And also you have to be sure of the validity of the passport. If you have any question about that you can ask or e mail me. Best regards ANON_NAME_0
