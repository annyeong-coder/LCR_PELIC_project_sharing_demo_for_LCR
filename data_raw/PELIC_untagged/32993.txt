This article is talking about movie superheroes movies . At the first was talking in general about whether the movie should be in a TV or in a big screen cinema . After that he shows the benefits of the movie if it's in the cinema and how will be better. We can summarize these benefit in these sentences he said that is difficult to make a series for example of that movie which is The Avengers and he said that he believe that will be there another part of that movie. However his opinion is if we made that movie for example as a series which is for TV and has many episodes will be there's no time for the audience to understand that these superheroes save the world and also the crater won't be able to write everyday a story like a great movie like that. Therefore these movies should be in the big screen. At concluding when we said that these movie doesn't deal with TV we are not mean that there's nothing in TV for superheroes theres a lot of series for superheroes and it's successful but these series dealing with a little bit of work and money not like a big movie like Avengers which is cost a lot.
