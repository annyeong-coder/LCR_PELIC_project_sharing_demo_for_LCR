The city where I lived in Mexico is called Los Mochis . This is a small city in the north coast of Pacific Ocean. Some people who are the same age than me think that the city is very boring but for me it's a good place to live. In this city which is near the beach you can relax because is a small city and it's a quiet place. But if you compare Mexico City which is the biggest city in Mexico you can have more fun although the life is more stressing. Now I will move to Mexico City to study the university and I'm going to live with my aunt who also lived in Los Mochis before.
