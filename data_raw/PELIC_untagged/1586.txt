One thing that I've been successful is playing ping pong. This play is so fast and it uses a small ball. I have some reasons to explain why I'm a good player. First when I was teenager I began practice this play at home because my oldest brother bought a table of ping pong for us during our school vacation. Second I could practice too much for many hours every day so today I can play very well with someone even when I stay so many time without playing. The last thing why I became a good player it was because that my brother was very good player so I needed to be better than him to win the game. Because the game is quick you need to pay attention all time.
