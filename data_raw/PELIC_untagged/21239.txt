Many situations need a specific type of English. For instance I had an interview with an admission committee and I tried to speak as much formal English as I can. Why I used formal English was that I should have showed the committee that I was the best one who could win the position. Speaking an impeccable speech leads sometimes to get what you want. Other factors that may affect your decision are education level of speaker relationship and others. Talking with your parents is not need to be perfect and professional speaker.
