I studied ELI in January. I was joining ELI and T. G. I. F. Activities. After one week I had a new classmate Ken . He went to ELI activities with his friend and he introduced his roommate Shawn to me. After that day we became friend while we were taking online a lot of time. We played games and talked about our countries different culture. I was afraid take bus when I went to my house. While Shawn was taking care of me I appreciated him. Later I liked him and then we became a couple. I appreciated that time we met each other.
