Grammar 3 time capsule There are five items to put in the capsule. For example a lot of money some dry food a lot of photo pictures one book and two clothes. When some researchers to find the time capsule in the future it was called'' civilization life''. In sixty years ago I put these items. In my opinion money is important object until now. Maybe they still can use it or they can find its difference. Dry food is necessary to us in every day. They understood what kind the food to people can eat it. When they saw a lot of old picture as if they came back the same time and they how to live in the past. Book is knowledge when they read the book. They can understand the history development. Clothes are important needs to us in every day. When they found it and know what kind the fashion in that time. All in all in my time capsule it was true life.
