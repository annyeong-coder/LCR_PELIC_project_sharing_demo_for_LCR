Soweto's Fashion Week is a three day event open to unknown designers which offers them the possibility to show their best work. The keywords of this exhibition are creativity and history of Soweto South's most famous township. The event is in its initial phase as funding difficulties and humble location demonstrate. The originality and the emerging individuality which come from each minutely decorated work embody South Africa's concept of freedom.

The hope of the organizers is for the event to grow in terms of duration and paying sponsor in order to give more designers more opportunities to stand out.
