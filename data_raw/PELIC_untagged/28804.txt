Technological devices in modern society are beneficial for our life. Living in 20th century we are at the new period of technological revolutions. It brought us more convenient life improving our life styles immensely. For example invention of computer and automobile allowed us to live lives very differently from the people did in an old age. Both of them let us live more fast and comfortable lives reducing wasteful time. On the other hand some people believe that the technology rather brought us social and environmental problems causing severe pollutions to our society. However I think the problem has been solved by a lot of people's effort to protect nature and it will be solved in more advanced way. Likewise compare to the technology's benefit the disadvantage of it is so tiny. This is why I agree with the statement that technology has made our world to a better place to live. As I mentioned above firstly the invention of computer changed a way of our lives a lot. People lived in an old days usually wrote letters by hand and they had to send their letters in person to the post office. It took a long time to make sure the letter arrived to receiver and to get an answer from him or her. Moreover since there are a lot of communication systems such as messenger we do not need to write a letter actually. Also we should appreciate to the development of transportation. Even though nowadays modern people go to work by driving cars or taking public transportations people in the past usually walked or rode wagons in traditional methods. Not only it took a lot of time to arrive at destination but also it cost a lot of money. In conclusion with the advancement of computer and automobile we are living in much more comfortable and fast lives. They have changed our lives decreasing our wasteful time but allowing us to use time more effectively. Again this is why I completely agree that the technology improved our lives brilliantly.
