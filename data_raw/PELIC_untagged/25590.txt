I live in apartment. My apartment chees me up because it is comfortable and clean. Management is also very nice. If I have some plumbing problems they fix it up very quickly. Bedroom and living room are too big it would be nice to hang beautiful pictures up. We put some photos up on the wall. At night the room is very dark so I have to more light it up. When I get back from a school I usually I turn on the television. I don't have many furniture so I don't need much time to straighten it up. Sometimes I change decorations I can look them up on the internet. I want live in a beautiful place it makes me keep on.
