The worst meal that I have ever had must have been the meal in four years ago. In summer of 2002 my family was traveling in Phuket Thailand. It was our first summer vacation to go abroad together. However we chose wrong period. It was so hot and 'heavy' rainy season. It was raining all day long during our whole vacation. The most serious problem was food especially rice. We were not able to adopt the specific smell of the Thailand style rice. It was really strange to us. My mother sisters and I ate bread milk and fruit repeatedly. For some Koreans including my mother and me it is very hard not to have steamed rice and kimchi for long time. One day I could not stand the tasteless dishes anymore. So I decided to go to a Korean restaurant to have rice and kimchi. After asking about Korean restaurant I hurried to go there. However unfortunately the meal in that Korean restaurant was the worst one. The taste of the steamed rice and kimchi was totally different from real Korean style meal. Despite I disappointed about that meal I ate all of it because I was too starving. At that evening I had a terrible stomachache and had to stay the hotel room without doing anything. If I visit Thailand again I will avoid the rainy season and bring kimchi for my stomach.
