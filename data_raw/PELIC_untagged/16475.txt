In my opinion I think that making friend in Internet is not good method. First of all in the virtual world you don't know people who talk to you. He can tell a lie for everythings to you. Secondly if you make friends in the internet you will waste much time to contact with each other. Finally I don't think that you can make real friends in the virtual world because I always read newspaper which tells many things about internet crimes . Therefore making friends in the virtual world is not good idea and you also have many changes to know new friends in public place such as school workplace and so on. Therefore you have much better opportunity to make friends.
