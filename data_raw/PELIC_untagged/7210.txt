Physician should not be allowed to kill their suffered patients even if their patents give them the permission to do so because of many reasons. First wasting the patent's life is a crime no matter how good is their doctors' intentions because committing such an action by doctor's injection is the same as by criminal's knife ending someone life. Second every disease has cure but not every medicine is discovered one day may be sooner scientists may find the cure or they may find promising medicine which may end the suffering or perhaps changing the patent's idea toward the suicide!. Finally I don't agree to give the physicians who suppose to maintain lives the chance to waste them under law permission think with me! If we don't trust our doctor's intention who shall we trust if we are in sever pain If the doctors don't see us in pain what the motivation they will have to defeat our illness. We live no body give us permission to live even ourselves and we will die not our business to decide when! Everything controlled by the higher wisdom he give he take he's decision shall be waited and respected.
