There are many cities in the Saudi Arabia you can spend great time there . All the cities in my country are save but I think Makah is safest city in Saudi . Biggest city In my country is Riyadh and It has tallest building in the KSA . The second largest city in my country is Jeddah and It has a tallest fountain in the middle east . Usually I don't like to travel to Jeddah because It is the most expensive city in my country . The best city of all for me is Damaam and it has the best beach in my country . All the people in the Saudi Arabia are friendly but in the friendliest people are in north of KSA . The most interesting city in my country is Abha because it has the beautiful wither in the summer . If you like the museum you can travel to the south of Saudi Arabia because It has the most historic museum in my country .
