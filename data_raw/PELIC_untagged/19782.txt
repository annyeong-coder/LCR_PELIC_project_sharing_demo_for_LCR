I don't think that the internet is a good place to meet a romantic partner. First it is difficult to make a best judgement whether the parter is really truthful and sincere person because we can't see the very bottom of the partner's heart. Second it could be very quick and short relationdship which might be dangerous. Finally the electronic system does not guarantee emotional relationship but the chemistry between two people should have somewhat emotional sense. For these reasons I don't agree with the sentence given in the above question.
