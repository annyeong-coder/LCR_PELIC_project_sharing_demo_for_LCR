Free time is very significant for everyone. We should know how we spend it. I always reading books and doing exercise in my free time. Sometimes when I feel boring I read a book. Its help me to learn more also spend the time. For example last weekend I was staying at home. I didn't find anything to do. I went to the books store and I found I a good book. Its called a secret . It was a really benefit. It had many different advise to make you think before you do something the other thing I almost doing in my free time is going to the gym. Me and my friend we hangout together to the gym. We always make a competition who is the winner. Such as yesterday we spent 4 hour in the gym doing the exercise. We went back to the home we were so tired because we waked hard. In summary free time is important so I advise you to spend your time in a good way to useful from it also to have fun.
