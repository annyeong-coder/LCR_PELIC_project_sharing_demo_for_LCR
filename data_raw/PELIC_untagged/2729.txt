Two bad effects of young adult's development. If young adults lack a positive role model their values and behavior might not be correct. Young adults often admire someone for example a movie star an athlete or a businessman. People always mimic the behavior of people that they like or respect. Children always copy their parents' words. For example my friend has a daughter named Fiona. When my friend asks Fiona to eat her food or to take a bath the young girl always says no to her mother. Her mother tells her Don't say no to me . Then she makes her daughter do something that she doesn't like to do. Once Fiona asked me to give her some chips before dinner. My answer was no. Then she said Don't say no to me. That she learned from her mother. It is easy to see how a child mimicked her parent's words especially the negative words. Children as well as teenagers don't have completely unique thinking and behavior. They learn everything from their family friends or people who they knew in the past. Therefore if the role model is not a good role model teenagers often mimic negative or wrong behaviors. For example teenagers saw stars drug form news paper. The teenagers may think that drugs aren't bad things because stars were taking drugs. And young adults may think that they can do anything that they like to do and they may always fight with people who they don't like. Take another example teenagers saw their parents smoking when they were young children. They may think that smoking may be good things because their parents always smoked. Therefore teenagers will try to smoke as their parents. From these examples it is easy to see how children or young adults develop their attitudes and behavior. In conclusion young adults really need a positive role model to lead them toward positive values and behaviors.
