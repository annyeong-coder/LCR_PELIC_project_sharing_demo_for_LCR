Jobs. Personality. Interesting. I have a sister whose name is Jin Young and she is different from me. And she is 2 years older than me. Many people said that we look similar so they sometimes can't distinguish us on the pictures. But we are different from jobs personalities and interesting. The first thing is that we have different job before I came to Pittsburgh. My sister has been working as a dental hygienist. She likes her job because she likes to meet people and she take care people's teeth whereas I have been working at trading company. I've never liked my job because I preferred to actively work such as flight attendance or designer. But I've been working at office. It's uncomfortable for me. Second we are totally different character. She is a sincere lady. Her sincerity shows off her character. I think she is now much outgoing than she used to be. That's why she spends almost time with many people to talk or she has to give advice to people about their teeth. On the other hand I was a kind of introvert person but I changed my personality when I entered my company. Because I had to presentation in front of many people and we used to have dine with coworkers. More I speak too much. So now I think I'm active and very impatient. So I'm rather short tempered and sometimes get easily excited about unimportant things. Finally our interesting are very different. My sister usually spends time to stay at home read books or watch movies in her free time. But I usually spend time to do exercise or go to outside such as running playing tennis or swimming. We are interested in different field but sometimes we had have same time such as shopping. In conclusion there is different in personalities jobs and interesting between us. But we have the qualities of the parents so we love and respect each other. And we are good matches like we hit it off well.
