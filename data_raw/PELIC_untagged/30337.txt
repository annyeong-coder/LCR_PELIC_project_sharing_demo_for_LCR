My bedroom has one bed that is locats in the middle. Also there are two nightstands which have some flowers on them. My wife who I miss her these days watres them every day. At the corner where my desk is there is a very tall mirror that reflects the whole room. My wife whose perfumes around the bed deoes not like me to change the furniture places. The view that I enjoy when I wake up in the morning is a very nice featuer about my bedroom.
