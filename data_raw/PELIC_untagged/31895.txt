After I read the article once time at first I thought it's a good thing because you can pass the class without exams or quizzes ! So I thought it's attractive deal But as far as I know that you have to turn off every technology you have in the class or anywhere. I think it's very difficult for me because mostly I spend all my time with these technology. My phone my computer the internet. The most difficult thing is when I want to looking for information or if I want to make a call . . ! The life it's so hard now to live without these technology.
