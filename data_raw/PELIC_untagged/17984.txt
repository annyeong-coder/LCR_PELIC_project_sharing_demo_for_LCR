In my opinion to join the student organization from the same country is the easy way to solve the culture shock. At the first there are several student's organizations in campus and all of them are welcome the students who come from the same country. Secondly participating with the organization can meet and make lots of new friends from home country so that can let us reducing culture shock. After that joining the activities with them or invite friends to explore the area that you are living. In conclusion after these activities can let us feel more familiar with friends from the organization so we can hang out or talking on phone to solve the culture shock.
