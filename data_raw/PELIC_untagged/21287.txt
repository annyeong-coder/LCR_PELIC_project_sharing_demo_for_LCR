I think that an organization exists like PETA is important. In my opinion although animal testing is a necessary procedure before selling some specific products an organization like PETA can help people to supervise these tests or researches. Furthermore a group like PETA can help animals to stop over testing or to avoid some kinds of un ethic things happened. It is a good way to maintain the ecological balance. So I totally agree that there is a need for a group like PETA.
