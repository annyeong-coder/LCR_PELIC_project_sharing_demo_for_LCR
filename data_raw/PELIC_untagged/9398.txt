On May 8th 2006 when I was riding my scooter on my way home I was hit by a scooter rider who ran the red light. I passed out when the moment I was hit. I have no idea how long it had passed and I was called. He asked me about my phone number to call my parents. Later the ambulance came. We were both sent to the emergency room and had some small surgery. After the surgery I was asked about the accident and was sent to the ward. A week later I was discharged from the hospital.
