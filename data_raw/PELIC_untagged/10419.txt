I leaved my parent's house last year and I bought an old apartment. So I worked it up a little bit. First they constructors throwed down a wall the one between the living room and the second room next they put off the old floor and put on a new floor and then they painted entire apartment . I remembered that I felt so happy the new floor cheers me up because sunshine illuminates complete apartment across the day. But sometimes the light was too much so I put up curtains and I picked it up with my friend Dany. Also I lighted up with beautiful lamps and when someone turns of the light you can see Santiago at night. I really want to come back to Chile and keep on working in my lovely apartment because nothing cheers me up more than that.
