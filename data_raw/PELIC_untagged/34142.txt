Recently I have watched a comedy starring Mark Wahlberg Mila Kunis and a bear. The content of the movie is that the live between a couple John and Lori and a bear whose name is Ted is John's best friend. Ted is John's Christmas present that was from his parents when he was child. Due to the bad relationship with classmates John makes a wish that is that he wants the bear become real and could be his loyal friend forever. The wish comes true the day after. They live together harmoniously until John meets Lori who has a promising job. Lori still anticipates that John will propose to her one day and expel Ted from his house in order to have a better live. Because John cannot easily forget Ted Lori decides to leave John. A few weeks later while Ted is kidnapped John and Lori corporate to rescue Ted. After saving Ted they live together again and enjoy joyful live.
