In my country they should solve the traffic problem. Every day when I want to go to the school I stuck in this traffic and when I finish it take me a long time to go back home. This traffic not only in the weekdays but also in the weekends it is always traffic and crowded especially in the malls and the restaurants. I think that our government should put some rules to decrease the traffic. Some examples of these rules are to encourage the people to use the public transportation because in my country the public transportation is used only by the other people. We don't use the public transportation not because it's not good or it's not cool to use but because mostly everyone has a driving license has his own car. So I think the government should come up with something to solve this traffic that many people couldn't stand it.
