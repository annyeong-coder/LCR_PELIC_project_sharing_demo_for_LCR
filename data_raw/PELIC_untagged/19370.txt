My best friend Eunice is important to me. While I was studying in university I met her. We became friends by accident. One day I forgot to bring books to class. At that time I didn't have any friends so I just chose a person to ask Could I borrow your book She didn't answer me. I tried again and spoke louder. She was shocked and then she turned off her walkman. I was sorry to make this mistake and I apologized to her. After this event we became best friends. During my undergraduate school we studied and played together. Even we had graduated for 8 years. She always stood by my side when I lost my boyfriend and quit my job. Until now while I am in America she keeps on encouraging and supporting me. I think that we will be best friends forever.
