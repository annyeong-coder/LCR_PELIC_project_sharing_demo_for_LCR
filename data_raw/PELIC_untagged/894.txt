Monday Oct 16 06 Dear ANON_NAME_0 I want to buy a jacket. However I find two jackets one jacket is leather jacket and the other one is jeans jacket. But there are two differences between them. First the leather jacket is more expensive than the jeans one. Second the jeans jacket is lighter than the leather one. On the other hand both of them are new models and they look very nice when I wear them. In my opinion the jeans jacket is better than the leather one because it's cheaper lighter and it's a new model. I'm still confuse so what's your opinion about this situation. Thanks. Sincerely yours
