Britain is the best country to travel for several things. I would enjoy do many things there with or without my family. First of all they have many luxury malls for shopping. If I interested in shopping they have more than 1000 models and I could choose the convenience for me. Second they have the best soccer team in the world called Manchester united. I would go there and make conversation with the players and take pictures with them. In addition They have the most beautiful and historical buildings and museums in the world. I would go to the wax museum and see amazing things there. Also its easy to make friends and relationships there so I would have many friends there and hangout with them or maybe do business and easy to communicate with them . Furthermore the most beautiful thing is when I would go hiking there and sea the amazing show in the world from high of the mountains. To sum up Britain is the country witch I would travel because of luxury malls best soccer team buildings and the amazing show.
