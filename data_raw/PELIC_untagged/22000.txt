I advise you to tell anyone about your plan and never do like Maready did. You must take enough provisions and money with you. Take a cheap knife a small first aid kit video and digital camera as Aron Ralston did . If any thing bad happen you must think carefully about your decision and always keep your spirit high as Shackleton did with his crew when they were trapped in Antarctic. And do not forget to add the number of North Shore Rescue in your cel phone . Try to be survived.
