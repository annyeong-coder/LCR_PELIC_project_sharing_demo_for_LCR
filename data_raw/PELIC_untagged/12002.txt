Today English ability is assessed importantly. We can find hundreds of English institutes in big city and from internet advertisements. Almost half of university students in Korea go abroad to study English during their vacation and mothers want their children to study English from pre school. This phenomenon presents how English is big issue. There are some reasons why English is so important today. People says This era is information generation. Different from agricutural generation and industrial generation knowledge and information are the most important resources at this generation. That means we should get those new things as quickly as possible. There are so many new information from books papers and internet but most of those are in English since English is international language. If we wait those to be translated the knowledge will be not new anymore so we should get that directly in English. The society changes to be gloval. The boundaries of countries are disapeared. There are many chances to work and converse with people of other country. In this situation English is prerequist because it is international language as I said before. If you are prepared at English you can get more oppotunities and be treated more important person. Actually many companies in Korea assess applicants with their English ability such as TOEIC or TOEFL. With the gloval trend many people travel other countries prequently. That's another reason why we study English. You know how hard time if you can't communicate with people of other countries. English can be one of solution since it works all over the world. As long as English is international language that most people use English will be used all over the world. Thus English ability will help you all around your life.
