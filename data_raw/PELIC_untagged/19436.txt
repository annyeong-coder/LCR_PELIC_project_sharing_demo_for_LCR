I met my best friend Grace while I was studying in elementary school. We were classmates in the same class. We didn't know each other. One day I was waiting for the bus while she was walking to the bus stop. I found I forgot to bring my bus ticket so I talked to her and asked her to lend me her ticket. What a coincidence it was! After that we became good friends. We always went home together after school. She moved to America when I graduated from elementary school. I was so sad! We still keep in touch. I am so glad that I am living in America now because it is easy for us to contact with each other!
