The view out your window I have seen variety the view out my window. There are too many wild birds in front of yard. When I first came in my home I saw two deers behind yard of window. I also have seen a brooklet between huge trees. I think the brooklet have small fishes. The walk road is straight in front of yard. There are a few people for walk at the walk road. But there are too many cars in the parking. The small pool is located on the right. But there is nothing to swim.
