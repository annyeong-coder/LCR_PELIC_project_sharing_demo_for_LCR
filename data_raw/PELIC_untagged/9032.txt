During last vacation I went to LA in where my best friend is living. Before going to there I prepared some plan. I had to plan very carefully. The dilemma was this plan involved in someone's opinion who I just met in Pittsburgh. He also wanted to go to LA and stayed my friend's house. Of course this is because lodging fee was so expensive in LA even though he also had his friend who was living in LA. I still don't know why we wanted to follow me. Anyway I decided to take him. But I should not have taken him. While we were staying my friend's house he made a lot of mistakes to my friend. I regretted that I took him. Maybe I should handle him. And I should have pitched him out to another place. However I didn't do anything. I even thought that I might not have met him. As soon as we came to Pittsburgh I intended not to see him anymore. Although I told my friend that I was sorry I barely missed my friend because of him. I have never met these kinds of person who is a very rude person.
