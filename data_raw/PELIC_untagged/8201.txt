Some people believe that smell plays a part in how people choose their mates. This should be a fantastic clue to find the ideal mate. I don't find this idea to be reasonable for reasons such as People have to be together before smelling Also people are not aware about this smell. Smelling the subtle odor requires people to be so close. And to be so close they need to agree for that when they first meet. So the smell doesn't do something for their meeting. They first choose each other accordingly to other reasons beauty weigh complexion heigh. . . Also very seldom are people who realy aware that smell would play a part in how people choose their mates. So how smell can act if people are not aware about this way of finding their mates Many people live together and have children but are not aware of this smell. Acording to above smell doesn't play a part in how people choose their mates
