Colombia is a place full of magic with places to know and enjoy. We have a lot of beautiful towns that makes you feel vivid and touch your heart. One of my favorite is Salento in Quindio department. Is a town that does not have too much people but the ones that live there are amazing kind and very hospitable. The town has colony old houses that are in different colors. The central square is a place when you can eat a lot of typical delicious and cheap food. Don't forget to try the Arepas in the street a typical food that are made in dough and have melted cheese in the top. Also you can buy a lot of crafts that are typical products man made like purses baskets clothes food etc. The most beautiful aspect is the gorgeous landscape around the town because is in a valley when you go up the mountain the full of green captivate your sensations. Is a destination to relax to have a homely met with the Colombian people and our rich culture.
