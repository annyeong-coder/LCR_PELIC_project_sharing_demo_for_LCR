My life style has changed in many ways. Before I stopped working at company I had never gotten up late in the morning. Before I got married I had eaten dinner out. Before I met my husband I had had many appointments with the other friends. Before I moved to the U. S. I had been resting. Before I started at the ELI I had studied English at Allegheny ESL. Before I recieved a Pitt ID card I had never taken buses without paying.
