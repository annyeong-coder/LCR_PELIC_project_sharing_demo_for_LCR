Self help is the best help when I came to Pittsburgh I thought everything will be fine but that is not true. Sometime I need an assistance from the another people around me. They give me assist but not all the time. Also they provide the assistance from their point of view and what suits them but if the help come from yourself then I will take the best helping . Even if I have failed the next time I will have a better.
