Even though some people who are at the high level of their work are looked popular whereas others are not that does not show that the people at the high level have accomplished more than others. Especially nowadays accomplishment depends heavily on performance of the person then who could reach more success than the person who is at more above. For instance let's think about the existence of a factory in which there are engineers who work under the chief engineer. At first glance the chief engineer might bring the thought of successful past of her him to our head. But nothing doesn't seem what it looks. It usual that coming across a person who has not at a high level in this kind of a group could possibly be a hidden leader and might considerably influence on decisions that have crucial significance which in my opinion means that that guy is a leader and draw the way which is going to be followed. Then the definition of success is hidden in performance not in the status. In my opinion success has flexible requirements such as performance and is not restricted by a status of a person which creates more fair world.
