People work because they need money to live. What are some other reasons that people work Disc I think working is very important to people because people are thinking and creating everyday. Some people might think that if people don't care about work of course you don't care foods clothes and house their life is better than before. They enjoy the life and always do something that they need. How about you Do you also agree about that If you ask me this question my answer is perfectly no. Here are some answers. People have to do something such as work practicing or enjoying. However enjoying or playing is not continuing. My point is when we enjoy something while we work in our life we can feel great. Also you can feel satisfy. If you enjoy something everyday it's not rest anymore. It also kind of work.
