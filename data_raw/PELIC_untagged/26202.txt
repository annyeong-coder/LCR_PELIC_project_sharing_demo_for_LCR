Recently I read book that I got more developing in my writing skills. It was a great opportunity improve my ability more and more . I want represent the book briefly and demonstrate how it's useful. The author Henry Nouwen who is write Seeds of Hope is more thoughtful about who has a low ability to start his writing. Its wonderful book but agree in couple of them and disagree with one point . I would like represent my opinion and explain that in three categories having something before to say before you write the writing requirement and writing stereo type. First of all as we can see Henrys views is having something to say before writing . I disagree with him because you must to do brine storming to decide what you will go to write. Even that if will take many hoers . As much as you have many idea that you will represent more and more to make your essay more efficient. Secondly the author represent wisdom that is the requirement . Indeed that is not only in writing but that important in our delay life . Any profusion in our life needs requirement to be success . The real act of trust is the most significant requirement. In fact if you trust yourself you will make your work more efficient and you will solve many problem s in your personality our behavior . Lastly writing stereo tape . That I realy agree with hem because usually 90 of stereo type comes from unprepared station so that absolutely will going to affect you negatively . Speak frankly you must change your opinion about writing that is not combined sentences you put it together but that is appropriate sentences that represent your idea contain good grammar vocabulary and organized . Briefly I agree and disagree with the author in three categories that I represent above . In the author has good advises that I learned and I enjoyed with .
