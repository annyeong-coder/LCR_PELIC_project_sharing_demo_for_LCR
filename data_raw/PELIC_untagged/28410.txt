In my opinion change is the theme. According to The Primitive Tongue of a Lesser Species Al was an addict and alcoholic. He was losing his temper to slap a kid who was a son of Al's girlfriend because the kid bothered him continuously. Therefore he vowed he would never do it again on his grandchildren who were actually his partner's grandchildren. That is change. Also In Grandpa's vessel the author was not good with his grandfather before his grandfather suffered from Alzheimer's. However the author became his grandfather's confidant. That is also change. Furthermore in these two articles after changing Al and the author of Grandpa's vessel all had a close relationship with their family members. Will and Jess in the first article and Grandpa in the second one In my personal experience my grandma had dementia which doctor said it was a syndrome of early Alzheimer's. I was usually mad at her when she kept on asking me where her keys were or if I ate lunch. After I come here I realized that I have less time to see her and I do not know whether she will still remember me when I go back. It is sad when I think about that. I think I can empathize the feeling that these two authors want to express and I probably should make a phone call to my grandma to tell her I love her.
