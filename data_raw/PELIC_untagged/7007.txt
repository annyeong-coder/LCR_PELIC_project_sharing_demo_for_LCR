I'm going to stay in the U. S. At least more 2 years. Sometimes I have to handle difficult things all by myself because my husband often goes away on business trip. So I'm going to study English more exactly. I think it will be good chance to study English hard for me. After I could understand English very well I might enjoy a lot of American cultures and I could communicate with many people from all of the world. Also when I might go back to Japan I could help my grandchildren's English study and volunteer to help some foreigners especially for students.
