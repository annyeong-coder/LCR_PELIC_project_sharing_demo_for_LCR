In my opinion art can be created by anyone. Because art is such a spontaneous action. Art requires being open mind and acting independently. Meanwhile there are various examples for an art creations when we observe streets. They who are the creators of the art are not trained and along with that some of those people from streets might be capable of training other people who are already trained. Besides that art shouldn't be under pressure and people who want to attempt to do art should be let in order to see how diverse arts are borning. Otherwise art might lose its value and also popularity. Let anyone who wants to do art and see what kinds of arts are occurring.
