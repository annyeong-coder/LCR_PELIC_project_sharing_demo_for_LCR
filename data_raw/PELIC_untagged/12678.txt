Today I'm going to share with you my new life that I'm having in the United States comparing to my live in Tunisia. First I just moved from Tunisia to United States and for me every thing is completely different. The educational system in America is easier than the educational system in my country. For example in my country we have regular class in Saturday and we learned in school with two different languages. Second the life cost in America is more expensive than in Tunisia in different things like the food the renter school and services. Also the weather in the US is colder than the weather in Tunisia. Even during the winter we don't have snow in Tunisia. In addition the life style in my country is harder than here because in United States there are many big companies for services that make your life easier and more comfortable. In conclusion I'm very happy to have opportunity to experience a new life style. I'm enjoying of learning a new culture customs and tradition.
