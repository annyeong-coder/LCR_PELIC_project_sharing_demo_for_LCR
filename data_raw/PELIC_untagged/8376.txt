One of the problems in my country that is still not fully resolved is the garbage on the streets of the cities. One of these cities is Tampico the city I was born in. The garbage problem in Tampico is huge. Perhaps the most sign of this is the big garbage collector just at the entrance of the city. In addition both on streets and at the beach you can see every kind of garbage for example bags of candy bottles of coke paper plastic bottles butts etc. But the saddest part of it is that you can see people throwing garbage everywhere! This makes me feel angry. Why do people do it' When I was studying at the University I thought that was an Education problem. Now I think that it is something more related to the feeling of belonging or not belonging. Our houses in Mexico are much cleaner that our streets. People take care of 'their' houses but they don't take care of their city because they don't really feel that is 'theirs. ' I think the solution can be to create a feeling of ownership in the people about their city. If people feel that the city is theirs the say way they feel about their houses is possible that they would take care of it.
