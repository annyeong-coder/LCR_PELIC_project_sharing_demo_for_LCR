I asked several questions to my classmate Albert. First of all I asked Have you ever ridden a horse He said No I haven't. I've never ridden a horse. Next he told me that he's taken a long trip by car with his family from Washington to Chicago. After that I asked him about climbing mountain. Then he said I've climbed a mountain twice. That is Seorak Mountain in South Korea. Also he's swum in a river several times. He's always swum in a river for an hour. From another question I could hear him about another experience. He's sailed a boat for fishing in Han River South Korea lately. Moreover he's liked to go camping with his friends. In addition I asked him some questions to swim with dolphin to go skiing and to play soccer. He's gone skiing and played soccer many times with his friend or family. But he's never swum with dolphin.
