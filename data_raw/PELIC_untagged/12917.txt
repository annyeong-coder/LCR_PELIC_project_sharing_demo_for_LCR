There are more and more people don't have job in my country. It has become a serious problem in my country. People who have just graduated from school don't have a job or they lose their job in mid age. Some of them they can't live by themselves it causes a serious problem. From my perspective there are three solutions such as the government sponsors them money provides them a job and educates them specific. First government gives some sponsor to people who don't have a job to open their own business. Some of them who don't have job may want to open their own business but they could not have enough money. Or some of them just graduated from school and they have many creative ideas and they want to have their own business. If they have enough money they can earn money by themselves. Due to these reasons I think government can offer them some sponsor to help them open their own business. Seconds the government can cooperate with business companies and arrange jobs to people who don't have job. Government can establish good relationships with companies and they can help each other to solve the problem. The government can give people who don't have job. Also they can help the business companies find good employees. The last but not least the government offers the education courses to teach them the specific skills in working. They can teach them some technology knowledge to help them understand the complex computer programs.
