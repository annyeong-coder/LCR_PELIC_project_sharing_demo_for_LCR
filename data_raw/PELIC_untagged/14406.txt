When I decide a job in the U. S. I will find that there are no job positions available. I thought that I can get a good paying job if I can earn a Ph. D. Degree in the U. S. Now I find that it is impossible to find a good job in the U. S. Unless I am a U. S. Citizen. I try my best to save money in case I cannot find any jobs in the U. S. After several months of unemployment I decide to move back to my home country. My parents also ask me to go home as soon as possible. Once my decision is made it will be hard to change. Before I came to the U. S. I was filled with the American Dream. Although I work so hard in the U. S. American Dream is still a dream for me.
