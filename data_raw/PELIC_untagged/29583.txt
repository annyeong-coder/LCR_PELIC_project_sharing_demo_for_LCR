The Blind Slide is a touching movie which is not just a football story but also focuses on the relationship between a NFL football player and his foster family. It's your decision it's your life Leigh ANON_NAME_0 told to Michael. Sandra Bullock playing Leigh ANON_NAME_0 won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress as well as the Academy Award for Best Actress. The Blind Slide based on the book The Blind Slide Evolution of a Game written by Michael Lewis received an Academy Award nomination also for Best Picture. Michael Oher is a homeless teenage black whose mother is a drug addict. One day he meets the Tuohys all of whom are white. Sean Tuohy's wife Leigh Anna understands that he has a good manner and an excellent talent for protection abilities. After that Michael adopted by the Tuohys has his own bedroom joins a football team and gets a tutor who improves his learning all of which not only change the boy's life but also make this family explore a profound comprehension of their life. The Blind Side is a semi biographical film which describes a new relationship bringing many influences and changes of everyone's mind. However the director didn't pay too much attention to how the daughter's and the son's thought are and how they deal with some situations when their friends have a few biases of blacks. Perhaps it is like their mother saying making your decisions because it's your life. Thus they ignore people's gossips since they love their new brother. This impressing movie is like Leigh ANON_NAME_0's charity and concern both of which have Michael start to melt his hear which makes the audiences trust that there is unselfish love in our world and understand that more blesses to give than to receive. Therefore I will strongly recommend people who haven't watched The Blind Side before to rent its DVD.
