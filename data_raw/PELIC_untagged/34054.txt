From my point of view it is totally normal for people to work harder and longer since life gets harder and needs more effort to be done. Some say that leisure times which are be with family or friends are of great importance for individual well being which is more important than success in work there is some truth in this however life is hard and to be a joyful person who have such a good time with family or friends you must build a strong life career. For instance those people who provide their children with good education and helth care and make their life easy are usually spend more time in work consequently they will have a self esteem which makes them feel better about what they have done for their family and people around them.
