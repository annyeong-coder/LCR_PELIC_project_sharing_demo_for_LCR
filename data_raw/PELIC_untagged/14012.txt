I remember when I was a kid every time I read a book I get lose the time and I could end up reading for 4 or 5 hours. I remember one time I read a book about the golf war it was around 500 ANON_NAME_0 and I finished it in one night. But now its impossible for me to that because I cant have that 100 focus as a kid I keep thinking about a lot of things in my life and after an hour or two I end up reading 10 ANON_NAME_0.
