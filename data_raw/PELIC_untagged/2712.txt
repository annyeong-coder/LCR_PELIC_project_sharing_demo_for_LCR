My young uncle Qianyun my father's young brother is living in the country in Chendu China. He had a difficult childhood. He couldn't finish his elementary school at the age of 12 because of his bad sick for a long time. My grandfather wasn't able to support enough money to his studying and his sickness. So he chose dropping out. After that my young uncle was able to learn some technologies on planting by himself studying. Now he can have his own small farm to plant many apple trees grapes and orange trees. He hopes his farm will be able to increase more!
