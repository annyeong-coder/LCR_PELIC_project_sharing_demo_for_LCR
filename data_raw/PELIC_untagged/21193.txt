When I speak English outside for example in stores and a post office a hospital I persist in trying to speaking English as correctly as possible. Before I start speaking I think what I am going to say. Sometimes I write the sentences that I want to say in advance if it is very important and needed to be accurate. Still some native speakers of English cannot understand me because my English has many problems in pronunciation and intonation. I can evoke many memories about having trouble with English in daily life so I feel some pressure that I have to speak correct English in society in the US. On the other hand I speak incomplete English with a close friend who is not a native speaker of English. That happens unconsciously but I really speak a different type of English when I talk with her. This is the very broken English of mine. I just speak words that come up in my thought right away. Even if I do not explain enough the friend can understand me. When my husband heard me talk with her he was astonished that my friend could understand what I wanted to say with my incomplete English. Without correct English my friend and I can understand each other implicitly. I relax and enjoy conversation with my broken English without hesitance and pressure. Speaking correct English is crucial for me because my stay in the US is going to be a long term. However I want to cherish broken English of my style because it means closeness and comfortableness with someone special.
