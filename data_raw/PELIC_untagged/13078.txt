At first I was confused by this assignment because mu English dictionary define profile as a side view of someone's head. I thought Why does she wants that She is sees my head everyday!

Some of my friends call me Pay Ha because that is how my initials sound in German. I am studying English here in Miami because I want to attend graduate
