To solve the problem of Grobal Warming we should start doing something we can do daily. I'm in favor of trying not to use the airconditioning. I support raising the temperature of the airconditioning in summer and lowering it in winter as possible as we can. I go along with turning off the light when we leave the room. And I suggest using our own bag instead of plastic bag when we buy something.
