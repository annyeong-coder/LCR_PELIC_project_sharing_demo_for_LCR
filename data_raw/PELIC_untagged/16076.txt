I had to give my cousin gift for my mother. So I went to Washington D. C. Before I arrived he had left to Saudi Arabia. When I called him he said you might have told me . I should not have gone without an appointment. Actually I ought to have called him when I decided to come it was terrible day I wasted my time and my money. I could have made an appointment by phone or by email. I learned lesson I have to make an appointment before I go to people.
