I have been studding in the ELI school approximately six months. Sometimes I feel bad sometimes I feel good. I feel bad because they should straighten up the classrooms for example fixing the windows throw away the old cover of the sun and hung up a new one. Many chairs should throw it away because they are old. Hung some landscape on the wall to modify the shape of the classrooms. Leave some stuff out the classrooms. They shouldn't give up and they should keep on looking up for everything old to leave them out. I'm not cheer up when I'm in the class exactly in the placement. They should pick out another classroom to use. On the other hand I feel good because our teachers look over our assignments to correct our mistakes. Our teachers let us in to enter the classroom any time and let us in participate together that assist us to improve our language.
