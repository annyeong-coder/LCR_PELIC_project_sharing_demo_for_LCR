My dad always says that my mom is unique in so many ways. For example eventhough she is saudi but she does not look like one. She has an oval face with a distinct bone structure. Her features are really sharp a sharp nose with a pointed tip and a pointy chin. What amazes me the most is her frickles she has them all over her face which gives it a cute look but yet naghty. It is almost impossible to find a saudi with frickles. She has beatiful big brown eyes and neatly plucked eyebrows. When you look at her you will think that she is smiling but she is not it is her cheecks that will fool you. There is somthing about them. She has an amazing smile drawn by her thin lips and a very warm voice. She is so unique at least to me.
