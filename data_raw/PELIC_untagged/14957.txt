My name is Najla Last Name . I am 26 years old. I got my bachelors degree two years ago in Food and Nutrition in Saudi Arabia. Since cooking is my passion I decided on taking it to a professional level. Now I am beginning my studies in Culinary Arts. I also paint occasionally. I enjoy almost any manual activity such as fixing a dresser or grouping some flowers into a bouquet. My dream is to have my own restaurant in the future and to be successful in what I do.
