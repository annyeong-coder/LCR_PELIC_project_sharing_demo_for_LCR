A guy wants to strike up a conversation with a passerby who is a dancing girl with a ponytail. The guy would like to praise the ponytail girl but he speaks ambiguously and might be too nervous to clarify his expressions. Moreover He is not cool and confident enough when he tried to make a positive impression on the girl so he doesn't interest the girl in the end.
