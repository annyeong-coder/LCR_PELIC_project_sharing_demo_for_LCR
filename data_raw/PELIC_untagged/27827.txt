Yesterday I hung out with some friends we went to Fallingwater. They picked me up in Oakland at 10 am and then we drove for one and a half hour. One week before I had looked up online the story of this place. I wanted to know something before visited it. When we got to the place I had to take my jacket off because it was warm I put it away in a locker. After we got out of the car we just started taking pictures the view was wonderful. Before we started the tour the tour guide gave out a brochure with some information related to the place. He also asked us to turn off our cell phones. While I was taking the tour I was trying to figure out how much was invested and how long it took to build that amazing house. At the end of the tour we bought some souvenirs in the museum store I bought a card for my mother. I am planning to send it out to Mexico this week. By the time we had finished the tour we got back to Pittsburgh and I felt so happy because I did not miss out on the opportunity to visit this gorgeous place.
