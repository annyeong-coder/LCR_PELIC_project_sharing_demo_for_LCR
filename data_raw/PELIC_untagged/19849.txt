Many people love sports such as baseball football basketball and golf. When I came to Pittsburgh I noticed that people in Pittsburgh are crazy about Steelers. At that time I didn't understand why they were mad for football game. Now I also became a devotee of Steelers. Korea and Japan were held the World Cup in 2002. Most Korean were wildly excited at watching soccer as well they supported soccer players a lot. It reminded me to unify the citizens each other with this event as a momentum. I am going to discuss popular sports in America and Korea. It will provide three things a ball game the winter game and field and track. I am going to compare with football vs. Soccer ice hockey vs. Figure skating and a sprint vs. Marathon.
