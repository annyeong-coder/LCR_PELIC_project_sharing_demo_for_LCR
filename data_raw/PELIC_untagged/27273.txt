In the closet Margot is desperately pounding at the door. But nobody answers to her. She feels that darkness begins to strangle herself to death. The air in the closet is humid musty and suffocating. Maybe children went away. She can't stand a complete silence. The weak and poor girl starts beating at the darkness in front of her yelling for help. Suddenly the door is opened. An old man is standing before her eyes. What are you doing young lady He is a janitor Mr. Jenkins. Hurry up or you will miss the sun! As soon as she listens to him she rushes outdoors with tears rolling down her face stained with dirt in the closet. She runs and runs until she gets out of breath. When she opens the gate what she can feel is only warmness and then she watches the blazing sun in the sky. The sun that she has anticipated for 7 years is gold and a yellow crayon and a coin large enough to buy the world with as in she has dreamed and remembered it. It is colorful and magic flower. Margot opens her arms to hug the amazing miracle to her chest.
