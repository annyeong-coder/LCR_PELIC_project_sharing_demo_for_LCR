My Best Friend I am going to introduce a person who is my best friend. Her name is Iva. She is from my home town. Iva is a very beautiful woman who has a long curly hair with a lot of personal qualities. In 2009 she graduated from Faculty of Electrical Engineering and she is interested in everything that relates with computers. Iva and I grew up together. We know each other more than twenty years which is a really long period of time to meet a person from evry prospectives. Having many same inerests and almoust identical pesonalities are something that connect us. Iva is someone whose visions of life is very similar to mine. Normally Iva has some reactions wich I don't like. However it is not very important for our frienship and I can put up with that. I am aware that she is a person who I can always count on. Having her as a friend is a huge advantage that makes me happy.
