Graduation is next month!I need to make some plans now because when exams start I have any free time. What will I do when I finish school. My roommate is going to take a vacation before she looks for job. I can't do that because I need to earn some many soon. I think that after I graduate I'm doing to take a word processing class. As soon as I learn word processing I will look for a job as a bilingual office assistant. It's hard to find full time job though. Part time job is easier to find. Maybe I'll take part time job before I find a good full time one or maybe I 'll take a workshop in making decision before I do everything
