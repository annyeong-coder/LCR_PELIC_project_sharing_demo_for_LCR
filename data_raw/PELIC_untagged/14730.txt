My last boss was a big help to me when I was working for him. In the beginning he got me training each department every three month. Them he made me have driver license. Now I'm so appreciate he had push me so hard back. Sometimes he let me to be in charge of a meeting and I never did before. Especially he never got angry at my mistakes or made me feel I'm not good enough He also let me made mistakes in order to learn. And I did learning a lot things from him. All in all he was a huge help to me in my life.
