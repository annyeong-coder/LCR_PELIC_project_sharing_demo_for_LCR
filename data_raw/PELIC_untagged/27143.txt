I just opened my own cake shop. Before I became professional at decorating cakes I had been practicing a lot. However my teacher said that she had never seen a trainee like me before. Also she was always asking me if I had ever seen myself while I am decorating cakes because I get so integrated. I had been taking courses in France when I decided to start my own business. By the time I opened my first store I had been giving some decorating courses.
