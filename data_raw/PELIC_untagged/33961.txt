Montenegro's Independence Being independent is an essential postulate for every person group and country. Independence gives freedom to do what we want and make choices and decisions without being influenced by anyone or anything. This is a requirement for every modern country. Historically Montenegro was a part of Foreign Yugoslavia which was consisted of six republics. It was a political system with a lot of difficulties and weaknesses. Because every republic had its own political perspective it was not easy to manage and Montenegro decided to become an independent country. Although we were aware that getting independence was a complex process Montenegrins had a strong desire for getting independence big support from the diaspora and the Government made a lot of effort to achieve independence. The first major cause of getting independence was a strong desire expressed by the Montenegrins. Without that kind of desire Montenegro would not be an independent country today. It took a lot of constant and hard work. Due to that we all worked for the same goal named independence. Many volunteers who were so devoted indicated how much people were passionate about getting independence. They would work hard but with love. Many volunteers had been assisted in a very important role for the Government as a result Montenegro became an independent country. Then the diaspora was so helpful for getting independence. They donated a lot of money for the independence project. Although they life far away they were involved in the whole process. The majority of the diaspora came to vote for independence. Normally they had to manage the absences from their jobs which is not always easy to do. Because of that the diaspora deserves a huge respect from all of us. Finally there would not be independence without the strong Government support. Only the Government can have that capacity to deal with huge projects like independence. They had work hard and constantly for almost five years.
