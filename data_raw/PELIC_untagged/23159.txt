Pride and Prejudice Pride and Prejudice was an adaptation of the homonymy book written by Jane Austen. Basically the book tells a story about the society and its behavior in relationship to each other and their social classes related to romance and marriage. Thus it is a book full of characters and descriptions. However the characters sometimes have an ambiguous personality. Especially the young lady who is the main character trying to find a husband for her closest friend. It is crucial to this young lady to find a husband for her friend however her behavior leads to a variety of parallel situation and misunderstanding. The book was really great and well written. You can let your imagination fly and create how the characters can look like and follow our imagination. On the other hand the movie can give to you a more prospective approach or can make you really see how it is the place the village the houses look likes in that time.
