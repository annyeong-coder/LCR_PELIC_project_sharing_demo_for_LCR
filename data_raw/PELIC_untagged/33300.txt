Last summer I painted our house. The job took about two weeks. First I washed the exterior using warm water and a mild detergent. Then I sealed all the chinks and pores in the walls with putty. After the putty had had a chance to dry I can paintedthe exterior. The water used because it is easy to apply and cleans up a latex paint. The This part of job needed to finish a whole week. I was very careful to apply the paint evenly because I did not want to have to apply two coats. A color was used that was very close to the original color. Our house is a two story house which meant to do the second story needed that a tall ladder. The paint can had to be balanced on the top rung of the ladder while I worked. When I finished the job I felt a great deal of satisfaction. I had to pat myself on the back. Even my dad said that a good job was done.
