Writing 3H Composition 4 Pittsburgh's food There are many kinds of food in Pittsburgh such as American foods Indian food Chinese food. First of all American food consist of hamburger hot dog and chicken nagate etc. Hamburger and hot dog are the most eaten. The majority of American in Pittsburgh like to go to the restaurant for eating such as Mcdonald's ANON_NAME_0's and subway. But some of them like to eat at home. They like the convenient food they bought in the restaurant or supermarket to bring home. There are many places where you can get them. For example In Downtown Oakland Shady side etcc. Second Indian food consist of rice chicken carry lettuce and spicy. Many people also go there even though their restaurants cost much money but if you go there you will be satisfied by their food and also you will eat whatever you can. You will also have the opportunity to see how they cook if you are interested. Therefore every time the people crowded because they eat more and also they have other things as fruits. There are just a few Indian garden in Pittsburgh however they got many costumers. Third there are also a few Chinese restaurant one in Downtown Oakland and north hill. They have rice hat pot eggs and soup. Many dishes that are part of the daily life of Chinese people are easy to cook. Mapo Tofu or for example Egg Fried Rice take only minutes to cook.
