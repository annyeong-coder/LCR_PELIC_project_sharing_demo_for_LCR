Ideal parents are those who provide the best kind of lifestyle to their kids. It doesn't have to be financially but mentally. They let them live in an environment filled with love and support care and joy. Parents which are always willing to help their kids and support them all the way are those that have children who grow up to love them more. A mother that provides her kids with love and compassion is what's needed. A father is the one that cares supports and advices his kids when in need. Parents who guide their children to the right path often have children that appreciate them and have a very close relationship with them too. Not only by supporting them but showing them what is the difference between the right and wrong path. Ideal parents are those that no matter how far their children go to they feel like they can never feel happier other than being around their parents. My parents are the ones that guided me all the way and supported me in all my choices. I love them and evern though I'm far I still feel like there is nowhere better than home.
