We have become a nation of food lovers and restaurants goers and he is absolutely right. Personally I have been to many restaurants and tried different kinds of cuisines but I have never ever thought that my best experience would be at a Middle Eastern restaurant. This restaurant which is decorated in traditional Qatari style is a place where you can be treated as a king for one night. In fact what makes it stands out is the amazing service. They have a very nice way of relaxing customers. We felt that we were more than welcome and they gave us the impression that they were enjoying serving us. In addition to that the restaurant has a wide range of traditional Middle Eastern and Qatari dishes such as Thareed and Kabsa all of which are delicious and sophisticated. Yet there was one special dish that I really savored lamarrived I was absolutely blown away by its beautiful presentation. It was visually stunning and it tasted good as well. The meet was so tender to the point I felt it completely melted in my mouth. It was seasoned perfectly and it had a wonderful combination of flavors texture and taste. I felt that the food was done with passion love and knowledge. I believe that they took the Middle Eastern food to a whole new level of sophistication. They changed my perception about the Qatari food and gave me an experience I'll never forget.
