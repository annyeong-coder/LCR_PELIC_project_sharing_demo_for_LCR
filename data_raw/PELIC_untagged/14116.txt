Being student at the ELI is a great opportunity to learn English. I have been studiying at the ELI in order to be well on my Toefl test I choose the ELI because of the recommendations and sister. The Pie chart shows that 66. 67 Of the students enrolled in ELI take five courses those numbers indicate that most of the students choose to take more than a few courses my interviewed with ANON_NAME_0 one of the students was very interesting. She said AT ELI the teachers love to teach. Because of this they make learning easy and fun both from the research and the student interview I think the ELI is a good place to study English. People from other countries should study at the ELI to learn better English. It is especially helpful to listen too many people speaking English. The ELI is a perfect place to do this.
