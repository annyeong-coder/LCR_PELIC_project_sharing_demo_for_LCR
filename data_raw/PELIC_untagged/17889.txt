I would like to introduce my Korean friends who I met at Laroche College at the beginning of my new life in the States and are in the picture. The lady who is sitting in the middle of the picture is a sister. She works for international students at Laroche College and chapel. Non Korean who is a brother is the friend of the sister. The man next to him is also a brother. They are really nice. And the man who is looking at me is my closest friend at Laroche College. At the very right my friend whose name is Sejin helped me a lot when I came to the States first. The girl next to him used to smoke with me. We used to talk a lot. And the girl by her taught me the basic of the English grammar. Above me there is a man who is behaving strangely came to Pittsburgh at the same time as me. Next to him the lady who is wearing blue shirts was really reliable friend. The other lady helped me when I moved on to the apartment. Thanks to her I moved on safely. Under the lady the man who is going back to Korea next week is going to have a dinner with me on Thursday. All of them helped me a lot to get accustomed the culture and language when I was having a difficult time. I won't forget their kindness.
