If I coordinate a picnic for the ELI students I must think of a lot of things. At first I have to think what we bring. I think we need some meals like sandwiches bananas apples. These food is easy to eat so we don't need to bring any dishes or forks. But I think we had better prepare a few napkins. Also I think I will bring some mats because all of ELI students can sit on them. Second I think I should bring badminton rackets so I want to play badminton with ELI students. After that I think some students will drive to pick the other student up on the day. That way I think we will have a good picnic.
