My grand mother One of the key persons in my life was my grandmother. She passes away long times ago but she helped me a great deal when I was in a junior high school. When I was 14years old I was in depression. Because I hate my height I was taller than other girls very much and I had no ideas what I want to be in the future at that time. When my mother told my grandmother this story she suggested that I go to a cram school for a musical company. She had already known I was interested in theaters. Without her suggestion I would not have auditioned for the musical company and I would not have good memories for this experience. In addition but for her advice in a lot of situations I would not have had a wonderful childhood.
