An accident that I have been part of occurred last year in winter in front of my house. My neighbour and friend was crossing the road from her house because she wanted to catch the bus. I was looking through the window when I suddenly saw it. She was hit by young lady driver who didn't have a driver licence. She was trying to learn how to park her car. She didn't disappear from the accident. The first aid was called by me. My friend was crying so strong. She was taken to the hospital and she was being cared for her for three weeks because her left foot was demonstrated. She had absolved serious operation. She couldn't walk without help.
