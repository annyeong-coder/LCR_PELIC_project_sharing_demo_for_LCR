Dear Ms. X who fed up with Dog Poop First of all Yes I do agree that it is important that she clean her dog. I suggest that you have direct conversation with her. Or if I were you I would ask a friend of her to solve this problem. Finally if she does not respond you might call the police to handle the situation. Then if she blams you about calling the police you can tell her this Had you responded to me I wouldn't have called the police. I hope that you manage the situation without asking the police.
