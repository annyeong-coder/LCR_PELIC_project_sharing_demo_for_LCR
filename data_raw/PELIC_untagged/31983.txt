Dear ANON_NAME_0 I wrote this letter to you while I'm in America. I hope you are well and in a good state of health and happiness. I have been living in Pittsburgh since I moved to America before two months. I have never been to America. It is a wonderful country. I love it and you will. I had gone skiing before six weeks. You will like it. I had been skiing every Saturday for one month. Unfortunately I stopped skiing two weeks ago because my exams started yesterday. I have been studying for the past two weeks. I hope I can pass these exams especially grammar exam. Finally I hope you can visit me in the near future. Best regards Tariq Al Bahhawi
