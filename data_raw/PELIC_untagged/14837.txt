My favorite place to eat lunch is our school cafeteria inside the Cathedral of Learning. Actually I have never eaten lunch in other place. Because my friends and me like to eat there. There are a lot of reasons. First It's so convenience. Cafeteria is very close to my classroom. So we don't worry about the weather. Inside of building is always fine. Second It is easy for me to find foods that I like. I like sushi much more than hamburger or pizza. There are many kinds of sushi. So it's nice. The most important reason is funny. There are so many students and they are talking. So we don't have to worry about noise. Sometimes we must keep quiet in other place because of atmosphere. But we can always talk about many thing in there. In addition we can meet another classmate who is eating in cafeteria and we can say hello to them. So I like to eat lunch in cafeteria.
