By 2006 I had received my driver's license in New York City. I hadn't gotten a chance to practise driving because NYC has subways buses and trains for commuting . I started to drive when I moved to Pittsburgh last year. I have some great memories of practicing my driving on the scary streets of NYC. I had been practising my driving for seven weeks with a friend although I was nervous I had a great time with that guy.
