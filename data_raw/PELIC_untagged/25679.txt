I started to study English when I had finished the 5th class. The 6th class which is made up of 24 hours English lessons per week is a preparation English year for each other years. Then I kept taking English classes 4 5 hours per week until I graduated high school. I didn't take any English classes when I was studying university and later that's why it was regressed. Then I decided to come to U. S. And improved it again to use it in my field. That time I had a change to make a comparision the educational difference between my country and U. S. We are educated English grammar much more than speaking and listening. I think the UNDERLYING reason of this is the big gramatical difference between two languages and we need grammatical rules to speak and listen. Another PARALLEL reason of this there wasn't that much native speakers that we can practice on daily life because the English teachers aren't usually native English speakers. In my occasion there was sometimes when I was in middle or high school because I was an exchange student in Europe in some summers and had some exchange students at home or at the club Rotary. In U. S. There are 5 lesson to take which are grammar writing reading speaking listening. And the teachers who are for sure native English speakers pay the same importance each of them. That's why students start speaking easily when they are still learning gramatical rules by listening their teachers all the time.
