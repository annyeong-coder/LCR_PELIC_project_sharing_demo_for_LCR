My son is a very cute boy. He is just 2 years old. He has a round head and there are some extra short hairs stand on top of his head. His eyes are triangles. The funniest thing is that he looks like he dose not have a chin. He is so lovely when he is smiling because his eyes change to two lines and he has two dimples. But his dimples are not in the cheek they are close to his mouth. In addition his nickname is strong so his body is very burly. He is taller than average and he has few sicknesses. Everyone said Oh it is a boy after they saw him. His skin is clean slick and stretchy. Any color suits him. So all clothes make him handsome. He always wins some praise when he is in public. People like to say He is so cute. His charm is not just on the exterior and he has a self governed character. He likes to choose by himself. He has his idea about what to wear or buy. Once he wore a black cap. I did not know why he used to like white. He said because he wore black shoes. I was so amazed. He know how to matching and he is so young. Also he is decisive. He just needs one second to decide what he wants and he never changes his mind. His toys and books are all his choice and still accompany him. More important he does everything intently whether another person does anything he does not care. Except when I say Dinner is coming He runs to me immediately. I think he will be a scientist because of the above reasons. Of course he has a lot of disadvantages but I love him in every mood including pleased angry sad and crying.
