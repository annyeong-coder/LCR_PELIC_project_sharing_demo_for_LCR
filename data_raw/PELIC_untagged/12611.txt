Fourth of July which is an important date in America is Independence Day to celebrate the declaration of independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain. Also it was meaningful for me because it was my first time to stay here and luckily I had a great time in Pittsburgh which was the 250 anniversary of the city 2008. On that day in downtown Pittsburgh the authority held the fireworks and laser show which seemed to be the greatest one these years. We had found the good position where we could see the whole view. The fireworks were amazing that looked like a lot of falling stars in the sky. It was sparking at least 30 minutes and let us surprise all the time. When the fireworks explored in the sky suddenly we also saw the spotlight which was reflected from the river. I had taken a lot of pictures at that night and I never forgotten that.
