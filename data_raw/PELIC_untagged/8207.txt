I hadn't live in a foreign country so this is my first time. Well I like to live in America because everything is new and exciting to me yet. Actually I'm confused the question. What's that meaning of these two below 1. How is it to live in a foreign country How do you feel to live in a foreign country 2. What do you think is living in a foreign coun try I thought that's the second meaning. The last time I misunderstood that to Why do you like living in a foreign country So I retry. Please let me know.
