Let me introduce how to manicure nails. First of all wash your hands and apply some handcream. Second use the equipment of cuticle removal to remove your cuticles. Next apply basecoat of nail enamel. After that apply color nail enamel. Last apply topcoat of nail enamel. If you soak your hands in water for a while nail enamel is quick to dry. You can make nice nails. But if you often do it it is not good for your nails.
