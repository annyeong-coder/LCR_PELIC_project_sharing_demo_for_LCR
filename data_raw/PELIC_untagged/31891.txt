After reading the article I think that the requirements to take the class are a person that is responsible that respects and is honest with the rules of the class. And most important is really interested in get a challenge and carry out of it. Sometimes I feel so absorbed by the technology because I know that it's attractive and entertaining. But it's destroying many cultural traditions. Right now people forget to live their lifes to communicate and to have relationships just for being in their Iphones Ipods smarthphones etc. In my opinion the class of the article tries to save and share part of an ancient culture. I would like to take this class but if I take it the music would be the most difficult part to leave. I love listen to music in every place and every moment. So might be hard to live without my Ipod.
