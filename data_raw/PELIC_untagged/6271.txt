My apartment has two bedrooms one kitchen and one living room. The two bedrooms are spacious. I hung up my wedding picture on the wall. When I am living in Pittsburgh my apartment is kept me out and cheered me up. On Saturday my wife and I went to the shopping mail because of buying a bedcover. My wife and I picked it up together. And my bed wasn't as comfortable as it used to be. So I turned it around. The living room is filled up much furniture such as study desk sofa and dinner table etc. I often spent my leisure time in living room on watching TV. But my apartment fee is very expensive. So my wife and I talked over a move into a cheap house. On Sunday my wife and I went to look into a new apartment but we would think a move over making a decision because we didn't find a something good. We would settle on a move.
