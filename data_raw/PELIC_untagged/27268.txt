I probably say the worst meal that I ever have was when me and a friend took walks to the mountains for the entire day. We both deside out of the blue in any day to go for a walk and so we go back inside our house just to get the proper atire. Just so you know my hometown is about 25 miles away from the volcano Xinantecalt aztec name now known as Nevado de Toluca. Continuing with the wors meal in one of these walks to the mountains we usually go for hours but we always mange to be back in home by late 6 pm not this time. Anyhow that date we jogged the mountains for long time and it was almost 7 pm and we were feeling very hungry so we deside to aproach a little town by the forest and ask for a bite of food but we only find a kid. I ask the kid for food and he said the only thing I can offer to you are tortillas we were so hungry we said we take along with some wild vegetables we find we make vegetables wraps and that for me was the worst meal I ever have yet the best also in the circuntances that we were.
