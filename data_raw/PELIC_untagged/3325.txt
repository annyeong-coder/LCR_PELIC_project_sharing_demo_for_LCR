I believe the author want the school to be more flexible in term of course content assignment and evaluation. Firstly Author believes that school should offer a variety of courses so that students can choose what to study based on their preference and can perform their best. Moreover the course syllabus should be flexible so student can be more creative in their study. For example student taking the art course should not be restricted their interest in certain type of art but any kind of art so they can enjoy doing with the one they like most. Moreover author believes that to grade every student under certain standard leads to competitiveness because every one need to perform the best work teacher wants to see not the best work student want to do which markedly prevents creativity. Therefore evaluation and grading should be made personally. Teacher should evaluate students based on each personality and performance. In addition student should not be kept under too much surveillance as most students do not like to be kept an eye on. So performance assessment should be made only two or three times. In my opinion these are the examples of how the author wants a school to be.
