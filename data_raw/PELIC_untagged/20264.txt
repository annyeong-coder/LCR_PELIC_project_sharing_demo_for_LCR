At the beginning of my 9th grade I was rebellious and had a very hard time to adapt to my new school which is the number one high school in my city and has the very good reputation on high competition good evaluation and strict regulation. My parents wanted me to focus on science while my inclination was in liberal arts. To compensate my love for my parents I chose the study group which had classes I disliked even though I could not sustain the intense pace. I remembered my physic teacher wrote a note on my homework Why not putting more effort on physic Too much pressure was imposed on me and I ended up with poor grades which shocked my parents and teachers. I struggled and suffered till the 10th grade. Finally my parents changed their mind I joined a different study group which had more subjects I was interested in.
