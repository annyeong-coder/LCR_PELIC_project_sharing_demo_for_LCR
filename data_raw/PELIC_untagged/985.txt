Each one of us has a good example in his life. For me my good example is my father. His is age about 65 but he stile work in own privet work. I like what he has done because he succeeds in his work. He insisted that he ask me many times to work with him but I refused. Now I am regretting but I stile have chance to work with him in future. I always ask my self if I had worked with my father I would have had good chance to be successful in business. If I only hadn't said that I don't work with him. On other hand if I haven't studied at university I wouldn't awarded B. S degree. If the chance will come again I wouldn't hesitate to accept it. One of my friends says If I were you I wouldn't refuse it. It is essential that we respect the point of view of our parents and do what they ask us to do because they have more experience more than us. In additional it is important for them when we respect their opinion.
