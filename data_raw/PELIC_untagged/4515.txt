BEST ROOMMAT FOR ME Jichul would be a best roommate for me. First reason is we have the same facts that are common between us. For example he doesn't have pets like me. Also we have the same hobbies. For instance he loves to watch the TV and he plays soccer football from time to time so do I. Furthermore he is married either me so he knows what does the family mean. The second reason is we have the same schedule. Such as he usually gets up at 7 30 am he takes a shower at 7 40 am he goes to work at 8 20 am he gets back home at 6 00 pm and he has dinner at 4 30 pm so do I. Also we have the same time for evening activities and weekend activities. For example he watches the TV between 10 12 pm and he goes to shopping on Saturday at 2 00 pm like me and he plays soccer on Saturday between 6 00
