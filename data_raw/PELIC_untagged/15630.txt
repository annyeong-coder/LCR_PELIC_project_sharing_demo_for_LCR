What if I had been more diligent in the early of 20's I have two things that I want to fix if I can go back to that time. After I got into the university I became out of my mind. I couldn't control my feeling that I finally found my true freedom. But at least I shouldn't have done what I had to do. I was lazy and I didn't even go to near the school for two months. I was only chasing what I liked to do. I wouldn't have done such a stupid thing that if somebody brought me at that moment. And I remember one cute girl that I ditched in a bad way. I would've been better off If I'd done right by her. I could've been and should've been a better man to her.
