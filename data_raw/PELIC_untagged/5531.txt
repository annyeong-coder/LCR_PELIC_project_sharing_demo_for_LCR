One day I wanted to buy a dinner to my friend. So we went to a Vietnamese restaurant in Penn Ave. We went the restaurant many times before and we often go there for dinner. At the night we ate a couple of egg roles for an appetizer and he ordered a cup of ice tea and a Hanoi soup. The Hanoi soup is his one of the favorite foods. I ordered two fresh vegetable rolls and a rice noodle soup as usual. After finished our dinner I wanted to pay for the dinner as I planned with my credit card but the manager said temporarily they do not accept credit cards. I was so frustrated because I did not have enough cash in my wallet. So my friend paid for the dinner. I should have had more money at that time.
