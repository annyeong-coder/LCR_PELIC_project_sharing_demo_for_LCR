In Islam kids must obey and respect their parents that Allah s satisfaction dependent on the parental consent. No matter what the parent do or say children must respect them. However Islam teaches Muslims different strategies of what to do if the parents are difficult to be dealt with. Interestingly that applies even when the parents are not Muslims. It was reported by prophet ANON_NAME_0 that paradise is under your mother s feet. Treat your kids the way you would like them to treat you with I can tell you that. In some societies for example the USA it is very common that kids will take their parents to a nursing home when they get older. This is exactly what is called Ingratitude in Islam. No matter what my mom do I will always love her and scarify for her sake.
