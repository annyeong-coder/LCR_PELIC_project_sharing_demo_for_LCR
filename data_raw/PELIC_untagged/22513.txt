I believe I am a person with many nuances. I'm a person who enjoy simple things of life such as walking through a park playing a soccer game or drink some beers with friends whom I appreciate. Some of whom had shared time with me said that I used to make jokes frequently. Well this jokes which are sometimes not well accepted are made in order to laugh a little about life. Once time a man to whom I made a joke misunderstood me. Fortunately that incident was not serious. Sometimes when I'm facing difficult situations I could be that man whose feeling are occult. In those situations I am more reserved. But most of time I am extroverted which of course have many advantages. For example It helps to figured out problems that involve socially interaction with other people. ANON_NAME_0 A Last Name
