In 2002 while I was gong home I met my friend who I had not seen for 10 years. His name is Cengiz. When I get off the bus he knew me. I was lookng hm and he was lookng me. It was surprised for hm and me. After this astonishment we started to walk. While we were walkng we were talkng. I was late. While we were talkng my wife called me and sad where are you After that I meet Cengiz everyweek or every month. Last I was working in my office Cengiz came there and saw me off about three weeks ago.
