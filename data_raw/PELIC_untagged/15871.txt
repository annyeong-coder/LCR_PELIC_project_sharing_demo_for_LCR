I believe that anyone can created art. That is depending on the environment and states. Dozze Green is good example he created diverse art. Graffiti is defined as illegal painting but green made it famous art The people some times cerate own idea for new art spontaneity they are making their art corporate each other or individually but they will be accepted if people wonder with new idea.
