There are several effects of winning a lottery Especially the thing I would like to do. First of all I will give the half of the money to my parents. I have been struggling to earn money for the rest of their life. As I give them some money they can spend the rest of the time peacefully and enjoyably. Also I would like to be a CEO with the money. Consequently my life won't be easy and I can expand the money. Moreover I will probably donate some money to people who have imperfect condition to earn money such as handicapped people and the schools I went. Because of them my life will not be only affluent but also brimfully happy.
