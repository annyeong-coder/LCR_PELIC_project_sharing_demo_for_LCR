Richard Fuller and his colleagues investigated why some robins living near urban areas sing at night. In a prior study some scientists believed that urban light pollution was the explanation about this phenomenon. However according to Richard Fuller and his colleagues light pollution had less effect than was expected. They found that bird's sing had been affected by urban noise. They did a comparative study between places where robins sing at night and places where they don't. They discovered that places where birds sing at night are twice as loud as at the others sites. In the future the scientists will study the effects of this new behavior.
