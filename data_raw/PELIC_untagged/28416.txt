My Soul Mate My soul mate is someone that has many good characters Such as being an honest sociable and easy going person. Also he should be a reliable person whom I can rely on when I have a hard time. Moreover I am looking for someone who likes to go out and have fun So we will enjoy spending good time together. I also like my soul mate to live in my same city because I hope to see him whenever I want. Also he must be interested in traveling that will make us discover many new places together. In addition I should have a lot in common with the person whom I love. So I think it will takes along time to fine that person.
