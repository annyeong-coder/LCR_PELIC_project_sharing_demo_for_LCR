I want to talk about my friend Eun Jin who has something special about painting and organizing something. I met her about seven months ago and we've been spending much time to talk about many things. She is some one who can sense other's feeling and have compassion to others. Thus many times she cheered me up and gave me comforts. I also like her husband whose blood type is the same with me. I'd like to talk about my friend the bible. Well you can think it can't be a friend but I got different way to call a friend. I think everything can be a friend. And I'm going to explain why it can be my friend. When I feel alone I read it and find the way which I can overcome. Sometimes I might feel lost and can't talk to anyone in this world so I read it which makes me insecure. It is difficult for me to talk someone about my feeling so I choose to read the bible and I feel it is my friend.
