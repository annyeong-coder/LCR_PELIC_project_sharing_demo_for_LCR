Among many categories I think I am a feeler. When I talk I think over and over if my words could bring some problems or my opinion has unclear aspect. So I seem to be a person of few words. When I get a trouble with somebody I want to insist my opinion logically. But I couldn't criticize the opposite person because I need a few times to think. After I back home I regret I should have said like this or like that. When I have to decide something I need much background information in order to decide. My husband who is a feeler determines directly with his basic instinct. But I can't decide without deep thought.
