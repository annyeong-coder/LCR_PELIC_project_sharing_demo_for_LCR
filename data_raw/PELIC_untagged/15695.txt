When I was in an elementary school we had classes of Moral education. In the classes we have read many books which is related to moral education. And some of the books said that sometimes we have to know what is stereotype and how to judege which are right and wrong as David C. Funder said in the textbook We desperately need to know which of the judgements we make of each other and of ourselves are right which are wrong and when.
