Bioethanol has attracted public attention as an alternative sources of energy. In reality this new type of energy source is already used by compounding with gasoline in some countries the United States Mexico for instance. Many people believe that the use of bioethanol can solve problems of fossil fuel such as its lack or its emission of CO2. However the use of bioethanol fuel potentially triggers a short supply of food in developing countries because bioethanol is produced by primarily corn wheat potatoes or sugar canes of which plants consist sugar components. In addition the advantages of using bioethanol as fuel are much doubtful. At first glance it appears that the new energy source reduces the emission of CO2 however in fact bioethanol emits CO2 more comparing with conventional energy sources when we consider about the need of the additional energy for refining bioethanol. The cost to refine bioethanol is also inadequate as fuel. From these negative effects on food environments and its high cost the use of bioethanol fuel should be prohibited.
