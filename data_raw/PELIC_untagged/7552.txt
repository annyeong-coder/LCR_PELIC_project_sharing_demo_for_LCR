my gernal attitude toward writing is really clear. In previous training of native language writing we do not usually have logic thinking toward writing. Because the whole concept about writing in Cinese is very different from that in English. For example we prefer a writing an article without a logical arrangement. In the other hand I have been training for writing in a logical method in ELI. Thus I can say that my attitude here is clear that I will be humble and will stick to the planc whch teachers give me and I will take those seriously. At last I hope I can improve my English writing abilities and the logical thinking methos.
