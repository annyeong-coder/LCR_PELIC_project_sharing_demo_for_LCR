I've been using my cell number for five months. The story began two days after I got my number. I was in a class when someone called me. I didn't pick up the phone. So he left a voice message. I couldn't figure out what he was saying in the message and it turned out that he got the wrong number. I didn't call him back to let him know that he got the wrong number. Two days later the same thing happened and he kept on doing that for two more days. From those messages I found out that he works in a hospital and he was calling to set up a meeting. Then I decided to call him and tell him that he got the wrong number. I called him and I tried to explain that he called me several times about a meeting. He told me that he cannot remember. I asked him to look up in his contacts list for my number. He asked me to hold on for a minute. After I had been waiting for more than one minute I gave up and hung up. Sine then I've never received a call from him again.
