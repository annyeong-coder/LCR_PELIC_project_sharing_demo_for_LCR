I wish my mother had traveled to the USA at the end of her pregnancy! If my mother had given me birth in the USA I would have had the double nationality American and French. So I could have studied in the USA without student visa. If I had raised in the USA I think that my life could have been different. I would not have been a Laws Students because universities in the USA are too expensive for my parents. However I might have been a champion of basketball and as a result I could have been taller. Unfortunately I wouldn't have studied at the ELI because my English would have been perfect and I would't have met all my news friends.
