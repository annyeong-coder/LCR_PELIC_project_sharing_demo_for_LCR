Causes In the world there are numerous countries which have various culture and custom. Today in some countries which include most oriental countries many parents prefer to have male children rather than female children. In case of Korea most parents would like to have male children rather than female children until a few years ago. Even if the number of parents who want to have male children decrease the tendency have remained until now because the tendency came from traditional culture and custom of Korea. First long time ago a form of family was a big family in Korea unlike a small family that Americans have been. The reason that the form of family had to be the big family is a form of society was agricultural society. In order to do farming fluently people needed much more number of families who have good strength because they did farming themselves not a machine. Thus parents of Korea in the old days preferred to have male children who have stronger that female children. The tendency of old days is descended to now days there are parents who would like to have male children rather than female children.
