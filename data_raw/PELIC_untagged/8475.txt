My living room facing the slope on the hill is bright and sunny. When I sit down on the sofa in the living room I can see colorful nature trees outside and I can see some pictures of my grandchildren and my paintings on the wall. So this room always cheers me up. I have an extra lamp from Japan in this room. It lights the wall up nicely with small shapes of crescent moons stars and flowers. Last month I turned our TV around so that I can watch TV from the kitchen because I would like to watch the news every day. At the same time I turned the sofa and a coffee table around too. But it has made the living room feel narrow. I should try out another way. I felt that my living room was being a little bit cold last winter. So I am going to take down the blinds and put up the curtains on the window this winter. I have to pick out their color from now. It will end up with being more comfortable and refreshed in my living room.
