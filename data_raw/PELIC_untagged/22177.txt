One of the most popular environmental issues is saving endangered animals. The most common reason animals become endangered is hunting. For example the red wolf once inhabited much of the east coast of the United States but is now critically endangered. The only way the red wolf will be able to survive is if people work together to protect it. Adopt an animal programs are a great way to help the animals survive. In addition forest cutting is a huge factor in habitat loss. We all can reduce the amount of paper products used and wasted. For example instead of using a paper bag to pack a lunch each day we can use a lunchbox. If everyone will consider these factors it will prevent the animals from extinction.
