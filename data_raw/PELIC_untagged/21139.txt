Seoul where I grew up is a big city in Korea. My family moved there from Degun the spring when I was born. I remembered our first house that I grew up in. My mother who worked so hard liked our front yard where she has a small flower garden. Also my father made small furniture in the garage where was filled of junk. On the second floor there were living room and bed room. I and younger sister used to seek and hide in the garret where was small and cramp. My younger brother who was smart used to seat on the swing by reading books in the back yard. We missed our first house that has a lot of good memories
