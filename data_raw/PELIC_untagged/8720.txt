My inner voice If I had listened to my inner voice things could have gone well but unfortunately I didn't. When I was studying in university I had an experience that taught me I should listen to my parents under any circumstances and if I don't do things are going to be worse. However my friends and I planned for traveling to Austria in Europe and we were young and our parents were so afraid about us. We decided not to inform him about any thing and fooled about our destination. Then we went and we got into many terrible. For example when we arrived one of my friends lost his luggage and the passport was in it. We wished that he hadn't put the passport inside his luggage. After that we went to Saudi Arabia embassy to solve this problem and they handed it. Then we went to a hotel but our reservations were canceled because we are so late for checking in. We had searched for another hotel but with no success. Next day we found a hotel but it was so expensive. We had tried to explore the city but we couldn't. We had no idea about any thing. We wished that we had asked or collected some information about the city about the procedures or even the tourists areas but we didn't. Day by day our frustrations were exceeding. We thought about our parents and felt all these wouldn't have happened if we had obeyed our parent and listened to them. We went back home and decided not to disobey our parents any more.
