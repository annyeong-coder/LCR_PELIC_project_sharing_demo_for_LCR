Thai wedding traditional In my culture most men and women have freedom to meet someone. After they know each other well they will get married. In general there are some wedding traditional that a groom and bride usually have done before the wedding. First a groom and bride had to get engagement before they can get married. The engagement start by the groom and his parents go to the bride's house and ask her parents for permission to let their daughter get married. The groom family usually gives the bride family dowry which might be asked by the bride family. The dowry might be money gold diamond or jewelry. After that the groom and bride can get married. In the past the engagement had been happened in one day and the wedding happened after the engagement for a while however now they are usually happened on the same day. There is a wedding party at night which is happened in hotels or restaurants. The groom and bride always invite a lot of people who are their relatives friends and friends of their parents. A cost for the wedding party usually is paid by the groom's family but sometimes by both of them.
