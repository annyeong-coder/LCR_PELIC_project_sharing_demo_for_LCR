My first week in Pittsburgh is the most difficult week I have been lived during my live. First of all when I arrived Pittsburgh my English language was poor. I could not understand and I could not speech fluent. For example when I arrived air port of Detroit I was waiting with immigration more than one hour. That cause I lost my backs and missed my plane. Second I was feeling as a foreigner and I had frustration. I found all things various between my country and Pittsburgh. For example there are a new culture traditions and habits in Pittsburgh so I made a lot of mistakes like when I spoke with American people I stand very closer with them. Sometimes I was feeling I'm a brainless because the lives' system in Pittsburgh is very complexly for me. For example I couldn't use the credit card or debit card and I couldn't buy any things from machines that cause I asked people to help me. Finally during the first week in Pittsburgh I was having phobia about all things as poor English speaking and listening and a new life style. But step by step during a short time I learned too much about American's habits culture and tradition so I understood how they are thinking. Now I'm agreeing with them.
