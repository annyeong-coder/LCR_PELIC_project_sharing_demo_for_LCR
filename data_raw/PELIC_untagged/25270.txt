Shogatsu The Japanese New Year Day Shogatsu is a Japanese New Year Day. The Japanese celebrate for a new year with their family or friends. This holiday take place for 4 days from December 31st to January 3rd of every year. Various events are held in this period. Shogatsu is very important and enjoyable day for the Japanese. On December 31st people have to see the old year out. At first cleaning must be done in order to forget bad things of that year. Next The Japanese eat Toshikoshi Soba which is a Japanese noodle. Toshikoshi means see the old year out. After the New Year in people go to shrine to wish their luck. People sometimes go to there with wearing the kimono which is Japanese traditional cloth. The famous shrine rings the big bell 108 times to get rid of worldly desires. It is thought that there are 108 worldly desires in our mind. Most of Japanese assemble with relative on January 1st. Children get presents from their parents and relatives. Children look forward to this time. They eat Osechi which is Japanese traditional New Year meal and drink Sake. Time pass is so fast. The outside is already dark when people notice time. Thus New Year holidays in Japan contain a lot of traditional things. It is also exciting and memorable. That is why I think this Cultural traditions must be passed down from generation to generation.
