Let me introduce myself. I was born in Korea. I've lived in Pittsburgh for 6month with my sister sister's husband and nephew. My hobby is a hiking and listening music. My father affects me about my hobby like fishing and traveling. Almost very weekend I used to hike a mountain with my father and mother. Hike a mountain involves great risk but when I arrived at the summit of a mountain gives a sense of achievement and it is good thing to live my life. My ream is not determined yet. Despite a little lack of skill I will study hard and get a job abut chemistry field. Because I really love chemistry. I am poor at English language. Especially listening. But I am going to try to study English.
