There are a lot of technologies these days and some of them you couldn't live without. From my perspective computers are one of the most important technologies. Computers could be used by kids and adults and in all fields that require this technology to succeed. Without computers you can't use the internet you can't call your family or friends using a webcam and you can't print papers. First to access internet you need a computer without this technology the internet is useless. The internet is important to every one because you will use it on a daily basis for several hours. For example people use it to communicate with each other or check their social websites. Also companies use the internet for their business and to communicate with their supplier. Second computers could make you close to your family and friends if you are far away from them. For example I am using my computer to video chat with my family and friends in Saudi Arabia so with this technology you could see them live overseas. Finally only computers could transmit a signal to printers to print what we want so without computers you can't print paper. For example before computer exists people submit their assignments in a handwritten paper so if they had a mistake they must write it again. On the other hand in computers you can erase your mistake easily. To sum up computers are considered the most important technology because of surfing the internet communicating with friends and family and printing paper. In an engineering perspective computers save time if you use it properly and we know that 'time is money' so computer is money.
