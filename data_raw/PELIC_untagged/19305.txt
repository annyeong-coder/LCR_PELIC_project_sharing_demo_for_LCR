Nowhere could I find my purse when I came home from shopping in an evening last summer. After I searched every corner of my car shopping bags and sofa the last spots I did not search was the supermarket parking lot and check out counter. But I didn't expect finding my purse there since two hours had passed and there were about 200 cash in my wallet. I could think nothing but that I lost my cash credit cards driver's license insurance card and pictures of my family. I was even imagining someone using my cash in a bar and enjoying the best ever free beer. Just when I was about to pick up the phone and make calls to credit card companies I received a stranger's call. A young man's voice asked me if my name was ANON_NAME_0 and what my address was. After my confirmation he told me that he found my purse and he was going to stop by my home soon. Half an hour later he was in my home. I was so thankful that I wanted to give him 50 for returning my purse. He rejected with smile on his face. He told us that he lost his wallet once and someone returned it to him without asking for any paying back. There had been 1000 in his wallet. He would always do something kind like that to other people. I was touched and surprised by his story and his returning my purse. I didn't have to cancel my cards. I believe good deeds will pay him back sooner or later. How sweet the world would be if everyone was as kind and considerate as him.
