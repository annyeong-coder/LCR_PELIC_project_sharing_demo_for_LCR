Pittsburgh is my new hometown since September 2007. My husband and I have car since May 2008. Before this time I should took bus when I wanted to go to the Edgewood Town Center to buy our groceries. I had problems because although the Edgewood Town Center is close to my house I could bring all the bags with the food. Sometimes I bough less food to could bring easier but I should returned soon and I spent more money. I felt back pain and I spent a lot of time while I was walking with many full bags. I was thinking about the best solution to my situation and I could get the best option to my time to my money and to my easier carry. First at all the solution to my first problem was bough groceries carry to bring of all my food with out back problems. That was easy and cheap in Giant Eagle. Then I was looking by internet for bus options from my house to the Edgewood Town Center. Fortunately I found the solution to my two last problems because in ANON_URLSPAGE_all information about addresses routes of the buses different ways and many more. There I wrote my address in the square travel from and the name Edgewood Town Center in the square to and clicked on submit. Then I chose the option Edgewood Town Center because that has many options with the same name. After that I could see three options to take a bus from my house to the Edgewood Town Center. Finally everything is perfect for me about my trip to buy my groceries because the bus is just one corner from my house is free because I have my Pitt ID and I can take my groceries carry inside there.
