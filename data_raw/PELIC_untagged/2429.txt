In fact the forecasts for tourism would be increase by 2020 for many reasons. As it basid in the book that the electronic technology is really facilitating this growsth by offering access to fare and hotel information online. Therefore by accessing online these kind of inforamtion we can compare the prieses which is easyier and faster thatn going to the stores. In the other hand. I think these forecasts must look at other profite of this case which is securaty. Securaty and safe are the most considartion for the tourism. For example I know I'm going to a country that doesn't have high securaty I wouldn't go which is today it's the most important things for the tourism. Therefore not just the facilitating would affect the tourism the securaty would effect the tourism too.
