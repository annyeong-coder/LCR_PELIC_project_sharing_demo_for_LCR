The Cathedral of learning was damaged by leaking of water for washing the wall. While the Cathedral was being cleaned the water absorbed the wall and came into some rooms. In one of them there were a collection of books for Hispanic Language and Literature. The room and books were destroyed. Not only flooding but also toxic smelling have happened by the water leaking. There are Nationality rooms in the Cathedral and some of them need to be repaired. It seems to be a big damage but the sporksman told that it was minimal damage inside and the University provide more money for covering the costs of the damage but he didin't tell about how much it will cost more. 1. Seep V to flow slowly through small holes or spaces. 2. Reimburse V to pay money back to someone.
