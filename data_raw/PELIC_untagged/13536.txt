To the Editor As mentioned in the article that money spent on research is almost always a good investment even when the results of that research are controversial . I highly agreed with that statement especially for the medical researches. Now a days we have confronted with many diseases and some are hardly cure for instance HIV. If we support those researchers and the result couldn't be 100 cured but at least we might find way to longer the patients lifes. Eventhough some research might have lots of controversial it meant that it has been concentrate to make the best result for that matter and the researchers know that they have to find best solution for each studies.
