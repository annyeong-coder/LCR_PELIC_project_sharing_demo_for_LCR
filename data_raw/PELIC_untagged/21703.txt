Three moths ago I was playing ultimate with my roommates. We had been playing for hours so we decided to go to get dinner together because all of us were hungry. We were discussing that we should have for dinner. One of them said that he knew an Indian food restaurant in Oakland as good as cheap so everyone agreed to go there. It was the first time I went out to eat with my roommates so I had to stay silent but I was very scared because it was the first time in my life that I would eat Indian food. At the beginning I had many doubts that I had to order all meals seemed identical to me very spicy. When it came time to order the meal I asked the waiter if I could order a chicken masala not spicy and he of course accepted my request. When it came time to eat dinner I had the best dinner ever. Everything was delicious from appetizers to desserts. I enjoyed the food very much and the dinner that began with much fear for me ended up being a good experience. I learned that night that people should enjoy and learn about the different cultures.
