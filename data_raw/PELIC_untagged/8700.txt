Friendship is a plant which we must often water . I don't completely agree with that sentence. I'm a person WHO is independent and I am not comfortable with that kind of friend WHO need to be in contact all the time. My best friend WHO lives in Spain is like me in this sense. He has a job THAT doesn't allow him to meet whenever he wants. But both of us know that it's not necessary because every time we meet is like the first time it seems that the time is stopped. When we have time we use to go to a restaurant WHICH is our favorite restaurant in Madrid to talk about our lives and new experiences. My friend WHOSE name is Rodrigo has passed two difficult years. He was a guy THAT had a close relationship whit his father and unfortunately he died two years ago. Since then we have been so close and I have tried to help him in everything I can. But now Rodrigo WHO has started his career as a Pilot cannot see me as much as before. In addition I am now in Pittsburgh WHICH is a great city to learn English but it is impossible to see each other. Despite that we know that it doesn't matter. When I will return to Spain we will meet and we will continue our friendship like the first day.
