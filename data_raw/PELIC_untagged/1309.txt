Writing 3 Final assignment ARCHERY I like all kind of sports especially Swimming Archery and Ridding horses but the most enjoyable one is Archery. In 1994 I began to learn the correct style of Archery from my coach. He taught me how to put the arrow in the bow pull it back and then release it. After that I started to practice alone and I organized my day. First I began work out by left weight for an hour and practiced Archery for many hours. I did all that to have a strong body. Second I managed my meals during the day because I needed three to four meals a day. I used to sleep from eight to ten hours a day to have a good night sleep. Third I studied the rules of Archery from a book to learn more about it. Lastly I joined many local's champion ships in my city and other cities. In fact the first two competitions didn't go well but after that I learned my mistakes and won several competitions. Since 1996 I was a member of my country's team.
