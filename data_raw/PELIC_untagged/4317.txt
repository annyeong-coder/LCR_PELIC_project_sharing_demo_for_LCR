Alcoholism is one of the big social problems especially in Western countries. Drinking a proper quantity of alcohol is useful because it makes people be happy and makes one's blood circulation be smooth. But keeping on drinking too much alcohol forces one to get poisoned. To solve this problem it is important to spread the knowledge about the harm of the alcohol for the people who can't help drinking. Even if we failed in stopping them to drink alcohol we should encourage them to get over the alcoholism and allow them to come back to the society.
