Final draft Personal letter October 20 2006 Dear Dae ANON_NAME_0 Recently I want to buy a Honda Civic but I am agonizing between a Honda Civic and a Hyundai Sonata. Of course both car are excellent. However a Civic and a Sonata are different in many ways. First if I return to Korea I should sell my car again. A Civic is easy for me to sell and I can save money because many Americans like Japanese cars moreover. The car dealer said that a Civic is more expensive than a Sonata but it is better than a Sonata. Second I think Sonata is bigger than Civic and if I buy sonata I don't pay interest per month. My husband wants to buy Civic because it gets good mileage. He thinks the most important thing is the cost of maintenance. So we are thinking about buying a Civic. If you can call me I want to hear your opinion. My phone number is same so call me. Warmly
