A weekend trip Making a good planning is very important because it will keep my trip enjoyable. First I will chose my favorite place. For example I prefer the place that has a warm climate and that has a beautiful view. Second I will prepare my passport and visa and I will leave plenty of time to do that at least month before my trip. During this preparation I will make my reservation for flight hotel and car. Just before the trip I will prepare my documents suitcases and a ride to the airport. Finally I will try to arrive to the airport at least 2 3 hours before my trip.
