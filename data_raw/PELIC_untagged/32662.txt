My friends who work or study with me have different personalities. For example ANON_NAME_0 that lives in Jeddah is very sociable but he does not fit with serious people whose personality are tuff. My friend ANON_NAME_1 looks like me who likes Indian food he lives in Riyadh which is the capital city of Saudi Arabia. Also he lives in the area where I live.
