I have some personal unsolved mysteries I need to know about. One of them is that one day I found my rear window of my car smashed when I got out of my house. The police came when I had called them. One officer said to me your rear window might have been broken by a thief. Did you lose something in your car the police said. I replied with NO . In fact some stones were found near the trunk. Therefore the police suggested that those stones had fallen and broke the window accidentally. The police left the scene. I was really pleased with their help. I went the garage to instill a new window glass. I left my car in garage for two days. Finally the window was fixed and looked like nothing happened to my car. From my perspective I think everyone should not leave valuables in one's car. In case of theft nothing would be stoten. I have been hearing about people who were robbed and did not find any clue to their belongings. Another suggestion your car should be monitored by camera so that any robber will be identified and found easily. Moreover when you want to leave your car somewhere for a long time your car should be washed so no one can realize it is left.
