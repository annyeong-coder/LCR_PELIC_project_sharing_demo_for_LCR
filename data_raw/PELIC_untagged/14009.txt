One year ago I went to Shizuoka with my boyfriend. We stayed in Shizuoka for three days. We went to Fuji zoo and Mount Fuji. Mount Fuji is most high the mountain in Japan. We climbed up the mountain. We looked at sunshine on the top of a mountain. It was very beautiful. In Fuji zoo we look at many animals by my car. Don't walk outside in Fuji zoo. Because Fuji zoo don't have cages for animals. We enjoyed this trip on summer vacation.
