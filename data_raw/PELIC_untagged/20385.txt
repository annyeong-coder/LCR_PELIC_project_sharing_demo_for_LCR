When I was going to be shipwrecked near a deserted tropical island and I have room in my lifeboat. I will take some fresh water to drink. I will take any an ax to cuted wood. I will take many matches to burning a fire. I will take a compass to know directions and I will take enugh maps of the area to know where is nearest island.
