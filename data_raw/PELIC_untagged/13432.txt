My life has changed here in USA. In Saudi Arabia I used to be out side my house for a long time. Also I used to have tow jobs in my country. It was very exiting. I used to play soccer in my neighborhood with my friends. I'm studying English Language these days and I'm spending a long time at my house because I need to do my home works and some practice exercise.
