Tom Higgins opened a new restaurant at Benson University and he called it the Undergrad Grill but this restaurant closed after a short period of time. There are several reasons that make Higgins closed his restaurant. The first reason that makes Higgins close his restaurant is money. He hired the first people he could find to do the renovations and painting. He ended up overpaying the workers because he wanted to get the job as quickly as possible. When the time came to open the restaurant he didn't have enough money to do advertising and that because he wasted all his money on the workers. The second reason that makes him close his restaurant is the quality and the prices of his food. Because he doesn't have enough money to hire a professional cooks so he hired several students to do the cooking. The prices of his food were very expensive if you compare it with the others restaurants at least the other restaurants have a professional cook for each of them. The restaurant has some stress rules one of the rule said no take out and that rule it doesn't make sense because there are a lot of customers who want to take out his food. For these reasons that I wrote it Higgins closed his restaurant because he didn't have any choose except that choose and he did it.
