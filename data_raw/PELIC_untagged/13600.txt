A scene can give people different feeling when it be showed from different way. A picture from camera could be clearer and more detail on the other hand a picture from painting may be more emotional. Let's talk about the same scene showed by photo and painting. In my opinion a picture from photo is truer then painting. Because camera can catch details which are easy to be missed and the details will provide more information about the scene. Also a picture is more active then a painting. When people take a picture it just takes few seconds and everything will be recorded natural. However a picture from painting is always take a long time to finish but the scene couldn't be always the same. So a painting is not as active as a photo. On the other hand a photo and a painting still have the same point. First both photos and pictures are showed beautiful feeling to people. When people look at a picture they feel it is a beautiful scene. Second both photo and painting showed what the author want let people know no matter it is a painting or a photo. Third both take photo and painting cost a lot of money artists have to spend a lot of money to buy equipments and material to create. Although there are a lot of difference between a photo and a painting they all show the same thing to people. Both of them all bring people beautiful scene and let people know more about beautiful things in this world.
