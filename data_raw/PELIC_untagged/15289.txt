My mother is a gorgeous woman I ever seen. You can call her a steel woman in a feminine body . She can handle her job as a general manager on a great way. Moreover she is able to face any difficult situations in our lives with her wisdom. Also she is able to hide her pain and comes with a smiley and friendly visage. On the other hand she couldn't satisfy with life style nowadays. However she is able to dress elegantly. I think there's nothing she isn't able to do it. I wish one day be able to be like her especially when I have children. Love you MOM
