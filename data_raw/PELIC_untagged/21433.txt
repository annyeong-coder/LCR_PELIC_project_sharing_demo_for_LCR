If I'm going to a desert island I will bring some useful things. I have to take matches because with matches we can start a fire for cooking lighting and keeping warm. I also have got to take a knife. I can cut food with it. And when I'm in danger I can use it to protect myself. I should take a toothbrush. I must keep my teeth healthy even if I'm in a island.
