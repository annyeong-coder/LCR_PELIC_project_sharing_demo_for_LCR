To Whom It May Concern I'm writing in reference to my application to the College of Coconut Sciences at the University of Blah Blah Blah. I submitted all necessary application materials on June 1st 2009 and I'm growing concerned your office didn't receive my materials because I haven't heard from your office for a month. My application packet included an application from an essay financial information and three reference letters. I'm hoping to start studying at your school in September 2009 so I would greatly appreciate hearing from you as soon as possible. With Thanks Faaleleiga Last Name Ph 724 338 7897 Leleiga.
