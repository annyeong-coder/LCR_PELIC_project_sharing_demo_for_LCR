Despite the fact that many people say that women are not able to pursue studies and jobs in science and technical fields I think women are capable of entering these fields. Emphasizing on certain limits for women society and public image prevent women from achieving their potential. Women's ability can not stand against them in this argument. Easily we can find a lot of examples of women who went against the tide and succeeded. Moreover society should change the way of conceiving women and starts a period where men and women can respect each others and stand together as partners to build better future.
