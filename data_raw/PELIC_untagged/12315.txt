My experience that I described in my previous answer question 1 is an example when I had flow and how it contributed to my creativity. Another example Dancing especially traditional dances is one of my hobbies. When I dance I always enjoy it. I never realized how long I've dance and I never feel exhausted. When I take a break to take a breath or drink for example my mind doesn't stop dance. While my mouth mumbling my mind drawing a dance. In one point my creativity reveals that I could create a new choreography.
