Coming to the United States is has changed my whole life. Before I came here I have applied to many universites in my country but none of them accepte me. After that my father told me about the education in the US and how good it is. If my father had not told me about America I would not be here. If I had not came to America I would be studying a different major in my country. If any of those universities that I have applied to had accepted me I would not have studied English. If I had not gottten my scholarship from the government I would be close to my family. I wish I could cook because I do not like to eat in restaurants. If I had known how to speak English I would not be studying English right now. If I were a native speaker I would not take the toefl to apply to the universities.
