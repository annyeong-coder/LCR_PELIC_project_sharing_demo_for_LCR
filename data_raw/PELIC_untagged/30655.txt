Before I came to America I had never seen such large parties. I had never experienced so many fun activities. Although I had passed many English Tests I had never thought I will learn many new things about English. By the time I was in china I had met a lot of foreign teachers but none of them can take care of me and teach me a lot of things like my ELI teachers. I had never thought I will have such a nice life in America. I love here and I love my college.
