Welcome to the my personal website. I'm ANON_NAME_0 Last Name and I'd like to share an information about myself . I was born in Tashkent. This is very warm and friendly city in the Middle Asia and I have wonderful recollection about my childhood my school years connecting to the this city. Usually people like the place were they spent their childhood and I'm not an exeption. Because of the hot summers we had to go out the city during the summers. So what why we used to go to the seaside every year. We usually went to the Black sea and spent there one or two months. I like swimming and my mom was always concerning when I was swimming to far away from the beach. While I was living there I every day used to go music school after the regular school. It was not easy for me . Because I always wanted to play games with other children in that time but I had to go to the music classes. I had great friends from my school. Almost all of them left their home town and moved to the other countries just as I did. And now there are living in the US Canada Austria Germany Israel and other countries. After we moved out from Tashkent with my family I haven't been in this city for 17 years and I haven't seen my childhood friends all this time. Recently we've found trace of each other and decided to meet somewhere. So in my very the very first day in the US we met each other in NY. After 17 years. It was really exiting. I was so overwhelmed. Some of them came to NY from the other cities of the US some of them came from other countries.
