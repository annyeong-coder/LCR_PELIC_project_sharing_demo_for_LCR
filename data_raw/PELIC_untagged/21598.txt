My family influenced me by making me to be a good person because they learned me how to do the best behavior. My Father helped me to drive a car to be able to drive myself to anywhere. He tried working hard to give me what I want. My mother urged me to do my homework by myself and to eat my breakfast before going to school. They let me to play what I like in my free time. They were a good family and the influenced me in many things so I'm still saying thankyou to them about that.
