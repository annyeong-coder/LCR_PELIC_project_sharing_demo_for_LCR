Sports provide opportunities to people who have few other opportunities. Nowadays sport players are intelligent people though they have not graduated from university. Previously it was said that a person who was cleaver at mathematics or linguistics was a genius. However in this day there are researches which indicate that if a person is keen on playing sports he will be intelligent. As a result sports provide many opportunities for everyone especially a person who has few other opportunities. Even though a boy is a good student his parents can't afford him to study at university. As a result the boy will lose an opportunity for study. In contrast many universities provide a couple of scholarships for students who good at sports. If the boy awards a scholarship his parents will not pay for his study because the university supports tuition and fees including living expenses. Consequently sports can provide opportunities for children to study. Furthermore some people are unable to find a job due to the fact that they have a handicap. The handicapped are hard to succeed in their life because they are unacceptable to work. After the World Wheelchair and Amputee Games which are multi disability athletic competitions for athletes with a disability were held in 1948 a handicapped person has been socially acceptable for working. Therefore with a sport talent the handicapped can become internationally famous. In conclusion for these two principal examples mentioned above sports provide opportunities no matter if you are a child or a handicap. You should not overlook your sport skill because sports are overemphasized.
