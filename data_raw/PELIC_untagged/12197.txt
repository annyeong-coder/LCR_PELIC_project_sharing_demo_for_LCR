Thing often don't turn out the way you planned. Before I was came to Pittsburg I planned to live in the dormitory until in August. But I live with my sister in her house now It's unexpected. What happened Actually 4 weeks ago I lived in dormitory. When I arrived Pittsburg at first day I went Panther Central and tell the manager that I want to check the room but she said You can't check in the room until you pay tuition fee. I'm so surprised. If my sister doesn't live here how can I do I remember that time is midnight. After I paid room charge I can live dormitory. Unfortunally It's summer vacation So just a little student live there. I'm so upset. Because I really want to talk Pittsburg student and improve my English skills. Moreover I couldn't cook So everyday I have to buy dinner. So I decided to move out the dormitory. This is I realized to thing often don't turn out the way I planned.
