Dear ANON_NAME_0 I was absent in yesterday writing class because I didn't feel good when I got up in the morning. And then I missed the class. I've heard from Julia the target of our writing learning and we got a homework for next week. It's my duty to catch up with the class. Could you mind telling me the assignment that I missed and the due date of the homewok that I 'm supposed to give it to you Thank you. Sincerely yours and best regards. P. J. Last Name May 22 2008
