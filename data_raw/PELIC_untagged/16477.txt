I would advise my friend to not personally meet someone she met online. The first reason is you don't know that you can trust them. Maybe they told you white lies and overstated their credentials. Secondly they might not eligible. They may already got married or have relationship with other people. The last reason is you should not disclose your personal information because you don't really know them so you don't know what they will do with it. These are my supporting reasons that I think it is not a good idea to meet them.
