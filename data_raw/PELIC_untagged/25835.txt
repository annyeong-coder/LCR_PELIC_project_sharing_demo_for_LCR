When I was living in Riyadh I could regester in Pont Park Univarsity in Pittsburgh. I wanted to study English language because I wasn't able speak English but I couldn't go to U. S daercte. I had to get visa. After six month I was able speak English. Now I can go and return to my contry becouse I have visa since five years but after five years I can't.
