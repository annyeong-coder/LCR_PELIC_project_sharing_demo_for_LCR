Lavinia Last Name April 3 2008 04 03 Writing 5T Stereotyping is a controversial issue today. Researchers have shown a particular interest in this subject. This attention derives from the globalization and the melting pot that nowadays has been characterizing every country. Stereotyping could be defined as a prejudicial way in which people use to judge people of other countries just for their nationality. The consequences of this attitude are fear not knowledge and a lasting separation between different ethnic groups. Even though someone argues that stereotypes can help to know a person completely unknown because of his her different nationality and culture giving a general idea about him her I think that to have a primary opinion leads to prejudices. This is confirmed by the behavior that people use to adopt when they face to particular situations that involve foreign people. This behavior is often a strong reaction due to fear. Every day in the newspapers we read about examples of this violent behavior. When facing to a person of a different ethnic group a normal subject tends in most cases to have a defensive attitude. I'm convinced that it depends on the lack of knowledge of the other. The fear is the cause of the separation in neighbors that characterizes every modern country. If they in fact are proud of their multicultural configuration the truth is that these cities are formed by other small nations. If the big problem of prejudices doesn't be solved this situation will persist and most of all it never will conduct to integration and to a common living. For all these reasons I don't think that stereotypes conduct to an even small knowledge of people. The main reason is that they are too general and often wrong. Furthermore I think that in most cases they generate prejudices which are hard to cancel and that are never positive since they cause fear unsocial behavior and division all negative consequences.
