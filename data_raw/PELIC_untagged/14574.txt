Yesterday I went to the Andy Worhol museum with Young A and Taizo. We had lots of fun but we also made two mistakes. The Andy Worhol museum's enter fee is free for Pitt and Carnegie students. If I have the Pitt or Carnegie ID card I can enter for free. But when we arrived in museum Young A realized to leave her Pitt ID card out. She should have brought her Pitt ID card. Also before I went to the museum I was very excited so I dressed up. The museum was so big so I stayed there for a long times. I felt so uncomfortable. I shouldn't have dressed up. It was so tired day but We enjoyed ourselves.
