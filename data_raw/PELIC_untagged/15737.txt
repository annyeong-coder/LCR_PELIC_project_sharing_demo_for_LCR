ANON_NAME_0 Baracaldo The Advice of Older People Grandparents giving advice is the most natural thing in the world. In my case their comments have been in of two types the first one annoying and useless due to the difference on perspective and goals nevertheless the second type has been very useful and special for these reasons I will always carry my grandparents and their advice in my heart. Here it is some of their advice which sometimes tends to be a sort of order. One of my grandmothers always says It is essential that you go to mass every weekend . The demand increased during the Holy Week celebration when she says that it is mandatory the family go to the church. That task is sometimes unpleasant especially when she tries to make you go to the Seven Words Sermon that ironically last three long hours! However she gave me great advice about friendship she suggested that I choose carefully my friends as sometimes people are jealous and have a bad heart. My other grandma always says that it is essential that you have fun and if you get marry it better be with the right man! She is so funny and she says that it is crucial that every person of the family take care of each other with love. As for my grandfather he always demanded that his family be honest. He also insisted that I be proud of myself and my family always looking up because I am worthy. My other grandfather always says it is indispensable that you work hard to achieve your goals nothing good will come to you without great work. It is essential grandsons and granddaughters listen to their grandparents' advice because it is for sure they only want the best for their family.
