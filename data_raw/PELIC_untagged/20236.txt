When I was a child I couldn't access to a private school because my parents couldn't afford it so I had to go to a public one. At that time my country was under a military government imposed by a coup d' etat for this reason educational methodology in state schools was far to encourage creativity activities were over controlled and teachers were very restrictive which inhibited any attempt. However my parents were aware of this situation and they animated me to be imaginative at home by means of a parallel learning . My mother who is a teacher noticed immediately my intrinsic inclination toward arts and she fostered these skills trough activities such as painting and modeling clay figures my father who is an amateur musician led me to sing and play musical instruments. In that way they intended to compensate the deficit of the academic program. And it worked these complementary abilities were crucial for my education because later I was able to apply it in order to facilitate learning of difficult subjects for example creating songs about the valence of chemical elements in order to memorize quickly. Sometimes hard situations make good ideas to emerge.
