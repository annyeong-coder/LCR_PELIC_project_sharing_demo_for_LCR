Reasons 1 Very simple life. 2 It had a nice memories. 3 It had a lot of leasons. Best Time for me First of all the time is the most important thing in our life. We should concern of our time and we don't have to lose it with. On my opinion if I could live in any period of time I would like to live at the past time. The most important reason is the style of life in the past was very simple and quit. For example the people were living simply communicating each other and helping each other. Also on the past we weren't busy like these days. On the other hand these days we are busy by technology businesses show off etc. The second reason is when I was a child I had a lot of pretty memories which were with my friends and with my family. Finally I wish I could avoid my previous mistakes by returning to the past time but I will try to learn from my faults.
