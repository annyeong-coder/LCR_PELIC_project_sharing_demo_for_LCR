Hi everybody. I'm writing this brief introduction to introduce myself to you our teacher ANON_NAME_0 wants us to write a profile about ourselves. First of all my name is ANON_NAME_1 Last Name Libyan nationality I'm living here in Pittsburgh and I'm living with my family which are consist of my wife and my son. My routine everyday is constant I wake up and go to the school everyday morning and come back home at 04 30PM. In general I have no time to do my hobbies because I often study for my English classes in addition studying for the TOEFL exam. My interests are shopping and surfing internet of course if I have free time. Nowadays I'm having high blood pressure because of the stress that I live in so I have to regulate myself. Sometimes when I fell stress I like to talk with my son although he is 3 months old so he can't talk or understand yet but that helps me fell relax.
