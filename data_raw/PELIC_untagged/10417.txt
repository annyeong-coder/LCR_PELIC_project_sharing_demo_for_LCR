I like my house except its size. I love my house because it is quiet. It is not located at avenue and there is little noise outside from my house. After school I put down my bag and sit down on my chair in front of my desk when I come home. This is my favorite time of all day. I relax my body for a few minutes. At the same time I turn on my CD player and listen to my favorite music. Everything is all right in my home but my house is not big enough for three people living in. I figured out this problem and all I can do is taking away the electric piano on the corner. Besides this I didn't have any idea to work out this problem. I even tried out to change the position of furniture but this way is useless. I can't also tear down any wall in my house. I think the best way to change this situation is to change my house.
