At last summer I went to Grand Canyon with my husband and my son. My husband could take holidays for one week so we could spend enough time there. I carried some snacks and some bottles of water for my son because he always wants to eat something when he rides vehicles. And I carried the guide book that I already purchased. We could visit some places according to the book. We enjoyed looking at the beautiful landscape of Grand Canyon and took some pictures.
