Still now I am not good at speaking English. However there are two types of English which I use to people. These are diverse factors. When I speak someone who can not speak less than I do I use broken English which is lacked a certain wholeness and soundness. I acknowledge that I violate English structures but sometimes he she can understand easily that what I say. On the other hand at the school I have to use appropriate English. Of course I am learning English at school so I should use correctly.
