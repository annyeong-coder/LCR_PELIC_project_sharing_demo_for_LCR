Abilities of my bird My pet bird has abitities now. He didn't know me when he came to my house first and now he knows me and then he is able to understand that I love him and he is able to understand that my sister didn't like him. When I got my bird he was a baby that he couldn't jump on my finger. Anyway a long time since I have him he is an adult bird. He has an ability to understand my attention to him. And he can jump on to my finger now.
