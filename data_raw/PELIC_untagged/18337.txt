While I was studing at university I saw a boy who was bowling. He was sat down close to me with a empty package. After I asked to the boy why he was bowling he told me that all his candy had been stolen. Therefore he couldn't eat having not earned money. I tried to console him for a while. I decided to invite him to have the lunch. Whereas I was buying a lunch for him he was reading my books. Upon starting to eat his face changed fully. I was witness of this situation on studying at university and I could help to the boy.
