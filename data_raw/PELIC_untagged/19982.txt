ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF LEARNING HOW TO COOK There are many kinds of food in the world. People survive by eating these food. Some people know how to cook some people don t. According to me there are two significant advantages and is little disadvantage of learning how to cook. The first advantage is to save money. For example if we don t learn how to cook we can order but this way will normally be more expensive for us. If we learn it we don t have to pay more. The second advantage is we don t have to wait for other people to cook for us. If we learn it we don t have to wait for anyone. However if we learn how to cook we have to use kitchenware such as silverware. After we use them we have to wash to dishes. This is the little disadvantage of learning how to cook.
