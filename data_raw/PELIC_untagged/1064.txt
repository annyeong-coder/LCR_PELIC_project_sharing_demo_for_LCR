October 24 2006 Dear Dad and Mom We moved to Pittsburgh from last October it is nearly one year since our staying in US. Right now we live here more comfortable than we do at the beginning. We gradually feel we need to buy a car. We are considering buying a used car it is much cheaper than a new car. We found two different cars in dealer but we do not know much about car. We prefer Japanese model car to American model. Some friends suggest that Japanese car is less oil consuming than American car. The car price depends on the product time mileage model and brand. The earlier product with higher mileage are cheaper than later product and lower mileage. However generally the Japanese car is more expensive than American car. We still have not made final decision on choosing we would like to get your suggestion. Love
