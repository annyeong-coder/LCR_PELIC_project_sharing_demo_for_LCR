In my hometown Taipei is dense population. My parents are becoming older and older so we decided to buy another house on the first floor. Therefore they don't need to run the stairs. I have some advice that would give to my parents to decorate the new house. First I want to have a studying room to straighten up my books and put up a map of the world on the wall. Second we can set up a solid table in the dining room and hang up some paints in this area to relax the stress. Third we should throw out some used dresser with inflexible function and pick up some brief furniture. Fourth I like the wall color is ivory so we should take down the walls with new paint. Fifth we never ever forget to leave out a space for my puffy. Finally I will write down on a piece paper to show how much it will cost my parents to repair the new house.
