There is a new approching way to view economic using a probability that a country is good at exporting a certain product. Economist and physicist input the data into a network and show us a map of probabilities. There are nodes and links. The former represent a products and its size represent the total world trade in that product. The distance between links means how much they are close each other. This new way has several advantages such as helping economists understand the growth of companies and countries.
