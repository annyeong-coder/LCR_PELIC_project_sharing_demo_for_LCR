I met my friend Rachel. She studied linguistic so she can speak Spanish and Chinese very well. My acquaintance introduced to me her. She is important to me because she can Asian culture more understand than other American and she always revise my fault about how to speaking or reading. For example first When she came my home she spoke a little Korean and Chinese. While she was speaking a little Korean I was surprising. While I was reading a book to her she was listening the contents and revising my pronunciation. Second when I drank Korean water or tea she wanted to drink.
