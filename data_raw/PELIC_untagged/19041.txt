Before I came to Pittsburgh my mother never got me to cook by myself. Therefore I started to help my mother prepare the meal. After practice she let me prepare ingredients by myself. Moreover she had me make a dish of vegetables. Furthermore she mad me cook a meal without her helping. In the end I can cook by myself now.
