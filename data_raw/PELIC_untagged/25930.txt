I hope that I can meet my soul mate who cares about me. Someone who treat you as a treasure. He should be the person that listen to you and comfort you. Someone that I can share everything and secret. Someone who think about you when you two are not in the same place. My soul mate is someone who wants to be with you in the rest of his life.
