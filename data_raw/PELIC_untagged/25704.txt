The flow is the state or maybe the schools suitable for children more than adults and the time in this school is not important. I haven't ever experience the flow but I've experienced the opposite of flow and the time was very important for the teachers and for me because the teachers want to cover the whole material that they taught and we have to follow them and listen to them for one hour instead of play at that age of eight or ten. I think that children schools should be more open time at the period from seven to twelve.
