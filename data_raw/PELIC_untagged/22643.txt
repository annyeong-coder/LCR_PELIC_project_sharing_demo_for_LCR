Mariah Carey born March 27 1970 is an American singer songwriter record producer and actress. She was the most successful artist of the 1990s in the United States. After unsuccessful period in her life she returned to the top of pop music in 2005. I like her music because she can do many things in her voice Control layer voice and can hit the highest note notecases in the world. She has many voices such as the voice of a small girl voice is very thick and very sharp voice. She has a musican talent. She Does not keep wolves like Helene Grimaud but she has a dog. She has not been poisoned like Beethoven.
