Yes I like to live in modern lifestyle. Modern lifestyle is living in cities attending schools and universities and using technology. It's interesting where I have many things to do in LEISURE. For example I can go to theater to see movies. Although living in cities is DISTURBING it's active. Also attending schools and colleges increase awareness and knowledge. For example people will REJECT rumors and myths. In addition using technology such as cell phones and internet is one aspects of the modern lifestyle. It's make life easier and convenient. For example I can communicate with anyone in the world.
