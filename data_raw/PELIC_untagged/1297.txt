The most interesting experience I have ever had with money was about four years ago. Every Saturday my father used to play Venezuelan lottery but he did not win any money for more than ten years one day he asked me ANON_NAME_0! Can you tell me a number and I told him sure! Number 8. My father went to a lottery agency and he played the number. Next morning he saw the results and we won a lot of money. Both of us were happy and we spent a few of money at investments and the rest of our money we put at the bank.
