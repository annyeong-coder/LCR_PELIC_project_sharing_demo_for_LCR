I coordinated a trip to VA with ELI friends we are from different countries in October. When we visited Luray Caverns we tried to listen to audio guide in English though they had our language ones. Actually I didn't understand the normal version but I understood a little the kids version. The kids version had a trend toward vivid and exciting expressions. Sometimes I chuckled at those. That was great achievement for me because I have never felt fun with audio guide in English. But also I found I had better eliminate adult pride to understand 2nd language more. If I listened to those in my language I might be bored. But in 2nd language those were good for me that means in 2nd language I'm still kid.
