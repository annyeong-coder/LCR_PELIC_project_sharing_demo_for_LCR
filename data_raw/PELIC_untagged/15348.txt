Considering the category of personality types on page181 Focus on grammar 5 I suppose that one personality category is closer to my personality. The category is sensor . According to the passage sensor is a practical person who notice what is going on around him or her and rely on past experiences to make conclusion. First when I meet someone for the first time I firstly guess what kind of persons he is from the conversation which has the clue to know his personality type. For example if his spoken style impolite or has some dialects intonation words and grammar he will be uneducated. Second his belongings can tell me his personalities. If his clothes which he wears mostly are colorful or vivid color they represent that he is proud of himself talkative or sociable. If his shoes are sneaker he walks very much. Third his friends are also related to his personal type. It is clear that he is gay if most of his friends are gay. In addition he will speak in more than one languages if his friends are international. As I mentioned above I consider myself to be closer to a sensor which is one of personality types.
