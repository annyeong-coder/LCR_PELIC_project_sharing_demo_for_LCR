One of the most interesting experiences in my life was when my husband and me moved to the U. S. I had never been to the U. S. Before. It happened in 2010. By the time we moved to Boston and we had been living there for a year. It was my first experience with American culture. Normally I had already had an idea about the American mentality and life stile but reality was the different. As soon as I came here I had changed my mind. By the 2011 I started studying English and I had been meeting a lot of interesting people from different countries. Also I met many native Americans and I had been facing with real American culture. So I had changed some prejudices that dated from movies. It gave me a new life perspective. Anyway living in The U. S. Is a amazing experience for me. I been living here for almost two years and I am really satisfied.
