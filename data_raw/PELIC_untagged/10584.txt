Life goes faster and everything becomes expensive. However many of us have asked how to save money these days. I'm a student and I'm experiencing that question. As long as I'm a student I have several solutions. First idea is to using public transportation instead of using your own car if you have one. You will be able to save the money that you will spend it on gas tires inspection or cleaning. Moreover you could use a bicycle or motorcycle. Cooking at home is considered the most practical solution. Nowadays there many malls that sell products with reasonable prices. Students can buy a bunch of food with getting a discount instead of buying separate food. For example you go to a grocery and buy a grain of rice for 7 dollars when you can get a bag of rice with 13 dollars. Feeling board and upset is a normal thing for students so they like to watch movies to entertain themselves. Therefore I suggest renting movies rather that going to a theater. It just costs one dollar per day when the ticket for a movie costs 7 dollars. I hope that you learned from my proposals how to save money.
