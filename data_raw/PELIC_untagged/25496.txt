A old of the person passes through many phases. One of theses phases is when he was in high school. I'll describe many things I used to do in high school. First of all my Mom is used to waking me every morning to go to school and I used to drink a tea with her every morning. Also My Dad is used to driving me to school. In the class I used to make some a wonderful activities. I'm hate used to take an English class but now I'm getting used to take an English class and I love it.
