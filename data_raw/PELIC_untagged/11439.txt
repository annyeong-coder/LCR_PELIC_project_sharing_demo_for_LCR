When I read this article I understood this difficult subject better and I became more flexible with the idea of open adoption. Moriah Dailer's story has touched my heart in many ways. First I saw the sacrifices she had made for her child so he would have the opportunity to grow in a loving family. Second Mrs. Thatcher and Mr. Keane are very unselfish people who chose open adoption. Including Moriah's sister's adoption they have given the chance to their birth parents to see their child and they are growing together as a big family. Finally and the most important is Phelan who seems very happy in the pictures is going to have a very secure and trusting personality. In addition he probably will have not only a nice relation with his birth parents but also with his cousin sister Tallulah.
