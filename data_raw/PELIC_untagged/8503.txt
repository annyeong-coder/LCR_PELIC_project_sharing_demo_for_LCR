My room is a messy. That makes me feel bad so I need to straighten it up. First I should start by throwing out the things I don't need more. Then I will buy hangs to hang up my clothes which are scattered on the floor now. I have just got a new computer. To set it up I should take down some books from the desk to a box in the basement. Once set up it will be easier to look up words by using the computer. I will set up the electronic Longman dictionary of American English on the computer. I also need more space in my room near my desk so I will turn aroud my bed. One thing I should do right now is to touch up the walls with new paint. I already called a painter and he promised to call back this week. Hopefully he will not turn down my offer.
