When I go into my room I see my white bed white table white closet and stereo. I awlays put down my cell phone on that white table. And my white bed makes me feel comfortable especially when I get back from school. In my white closet there are whole file of my clothes. It is not quite organized. When I find my clothes I sometimes have hard time to find out where it is. I have my metal trash can in my room too. I cna always throw away the trash. It lookd very modern but I like it. There are stereo in my room. When I can't sleep I turn on the music. I never leave out the door open when I am listening to something. Because that could be noisy. Even though I have my door open I set up the volume low. I don't want to have my house too noisy. I like my room alot. My room makes me feel cozy. I can keep my privacy in the my room.
