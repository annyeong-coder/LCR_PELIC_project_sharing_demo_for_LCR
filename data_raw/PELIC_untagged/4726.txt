Seoul that I came from is very busy and lively city. Skyscrapers many cars and people are all around. However during the night all the noises gradually calm down and colorful lights come up. The night of Seoul is filled with glittering lights. Buildings and bridges are colored by neon lights. Especially the view from the Han River is tremendous. Han River reflects the street lights alongside the road. I can enjoy gentle wind on the riverside with a beautiful view. Also on top of the Namsan Mountain which is located at the center of Seoul I can look around Seoul which is decorated with dim or dazzling lights. I have visited many cities but Seoul is the most beautiful city when the time is night.
