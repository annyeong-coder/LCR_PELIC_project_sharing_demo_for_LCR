These movies based on J. K. Rowling's famous novel series were responsible for launching Daniel Radcliffe Rupert Grint and Emma ANON_NAME_0. This Chinese American director has directed Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon winning the best director in the 78th Oscar for another movie Brokeback Mountain. This movie directed by Michael Bay is based on a 1980s' famous American cartoon. These two movies both of whose main actress is ANON_NAME_1 Hathaway are about how a normal girl changes to be the princess of a small country. These three movies all of which are adapted from John Ronald Reuel Tolkien's novel are considered to be the greatest fantasy movie series in the world. I like Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise both of whom acted in a Vampire movie in 1994.
