My doctor's office very clean and neat. When you walk in the door the back wall is lined with the bookcases. The desk is in the middle of the office. The doctor's chair is in the front of the bookcases behind the desk. Our chairs are on the opposite side of the doctor's chair in front of the desk. Her laptop computer is on the top of the desk where it is easy for her to reach. To the left of the computer she keeps a basket with pens pencils erasers and paper clips. The large window is on the right wall. The flowers are under the window. There is a picture on the left wall. I like my doctor's office I feel very comfortable when I visit it.
