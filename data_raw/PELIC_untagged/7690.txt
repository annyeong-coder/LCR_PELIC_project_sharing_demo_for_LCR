I met my husband at my friend's house in 1969 while I was working at M. H. I. . He also worked at the same company but in a different devision. My friend had already gotten married. She graduated from the same college and worked at the same compony with me before her getting married. Her husband also worked at the same company as my husband's colleague. They invited us to eat dinner at their house because they intended to introduce us for marriage. After that we often dated and enjoyed skiing camping hiking and eating dinner with his colleagues. One year and a half after I met him we got married. When we got married my mother was hospitalized. However she could attend our wedding ceremony with her nurse.
