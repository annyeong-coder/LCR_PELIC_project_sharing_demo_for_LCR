Vegetarian diet. Often people use different diets to improve their health or manage a heath condition. However not all diets are created equal. In my opinion a vegetarian diet may not be the best choice for healthier living. The human body needs variety of nutrients to sustain life. These nutrients come from the food we eat and consist of carbohydrates protein fat micronutrients and vitamins. For example protein contains some essential amino acids that only be found in animal products. For some group of people vegetarian diet is not recommended. In several studies it was found that pregnant women who follow strict vegetarian diet are more likely to have babies with birth defects. Also in older people and individuals with chronic illnesses there is a greater risk to worsen their condition without a balanced diet. It is necessary for our food to have a balanced composition of all nutrients used in building and maintaining our body. To reach an optimal balance our food should come from different sources.
