I think the best guardian is Lydia because first of all she wan nominated by the parents so that means they had thought about ANON_NAME_0 and Henry and Violet and even Caroline's sister but they want Lydia because they were seeing something we don't see yet here is my question why did not think about victor' parents because they saw they are not good guardian to take care of children. Secondly they love her as sister and they know she works but they know she might change her mind with work and stay with children's money because they are milliner. Finally children adore her as you know Meredith wants to be like her aunt Lydia musician and they will be a warm loving between them and they will not have any problem because she has full time with after she quit her job and they will not have any money's problem so I think Lydia is the best guardian for the children like the parents think. ANON_NAME_0 is not a good guardian because as all know he and her wife are divorced and he is irresponsible as crowline said because he has serious money problems however his father did not help him that time that means something is wrong with this man so I don't think he is a good guardian at all.
