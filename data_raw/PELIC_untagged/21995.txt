Six month ago I went to Italy Austria and France with my uncle and my cousin. First we visited the city of Milan in Italy and spent three days. We took comfort in the first day . In the next day we went to the plaza of the Doumo and we took many of pictures. In the third day we went to the shopping in Milan mall. After that we went to Venice by train. We spent three days there. In the three days did the same thing we went to the rivers and boarded boats. After that we went to Austria by train also. We spent four days there in small city called Zell Am See there was very beautiful and quiet. We did many things there like swamming and skying. Four days we spent in Zell Am See was the most beautiful days. Last three days we spent in Paris. The weather in Paris was warm but nice. During the three days we visited the Eiffel Tower Louver Museum and boarded a ship and we took a ride around Paris. Finally we go back to the hotel for the processing of luggage in preparation fpr returning to our country. Was the most beautiful travel in my life because I traveled with the pepole dearest to my heart. The duration of the trip almost thirteen days.
