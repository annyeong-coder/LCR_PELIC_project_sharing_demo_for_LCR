Ti would give a new ELI student this advice to them succeed in learning English . The most important thing is doing the homework because if you do your homework you will always succeed. Another thing is to attend all your classes and never miss or skip any classes. Also you have to study and practice what you are learning daily. In addition you have to make a good relationship with your class mates so they can help you if you need help. Finally talking to native speakers is also something very useful.
