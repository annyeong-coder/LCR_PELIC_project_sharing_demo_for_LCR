HI I am ANON_NAME_0 abdullatif ALBenayyan . I have been studying English as a second language since 1998 . I am continuing English language now in ELI at Pitt . For a long time I didn't see my family but I had used to it. When I had a free time here I tried to do something I used to do in my country like hunting but it is not available here . I have decided to try new fun things such as skiing or skating .
