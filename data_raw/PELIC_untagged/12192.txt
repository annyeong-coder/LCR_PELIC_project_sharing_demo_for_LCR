Good things happen when you least expect them. Sometimes good things used to happen when I least expect them. For example as I child I used to expect to come my birtday because of present and birthday party. On my birthday morning when I 12years old I expected big party and present. But nobody remember my birthday. Finally I gave up about my birthday party.
