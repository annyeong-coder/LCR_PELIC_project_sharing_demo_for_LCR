I have never thought about my own personality myself seriously. Some of my friends who spend a lot of time with me told me you are really optimistic you never lose your temper and you are always smiling. Actually I always try to recall positive things when I faced on the worst. For example eating food in a restaurant with my friend we got dissatisfied dishes. The dishes which we ate in the restaurant tasted flat. My friend who is particular about what he eats complained about tasted but I said him it will be good for our health. It made we both could laugh and finished eating. I also accepted almost all pieces of advice which is given for me to change my action even if the person who gave me an advice were using a bad word which can make me angry. Sometimes I feel bad for that word but it's going to be good for me. My parents who always teach me to become a person who put others first are pretty proud of my personality. Smiling every time is my habitual characteristic. However it might be a good or bad thing for me because smiling may be awkward silence in some moods. When I went to PC room where I used to visit to meet my friend there were serious mood with quarrelling because one student who don't want to wait cut in the line without agreement. The other student whose turn is coming was upset and made small argument. It was a time when I must not smile but my habitual action didn't let me keep regular face. It was one of my shameful behaviors. No matter how I feel shy in my personality for some moods I am satisfying myself because always being optimistic makes me feel better.
