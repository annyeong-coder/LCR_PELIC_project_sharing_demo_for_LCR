I chose a lot of fresh water some fishing equipment enough matches a telescope and some maps of the area. I chose the fresh water because the sea water is salty and it's not drinkable. I chose the fishing equipment to use it in fishing. I chose the matches to ignite the fire for cooking and getting warm. I chose the telescope to discover if there is another island or if there is a ship passing near this island to help me. I chose the maps to see if there are buildings or island nearby . My choices ware to guarantee food and to find out some help to leave this island.
