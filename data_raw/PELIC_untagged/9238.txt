A reporter asked Marie how she had become the Queen of France. Marie answered that she had to go to France to live in the French court when she was fourteen. She added that she hadn't known she would have to marry Louis XIV. Then the reporter asked her how she felt about the fact that she was the Queen. Marie responded that she loved Paris and it was so lively and beautiful there compared to Germany. When she was asked what she said to the poor who complained that they had no food to eat she replied she let them eat cake. She pointed out she didn't care what they thought and she was the queen on the question whether they would react well to her statement. It was claimed that the reporter screaming that he had an exclusive story for the next day's paper left the royal palace.
