Difficult of living in a foreign Country. First is meet the city your rules and lawyer but I don't have problems in the future. Second if It is different language the communication is difficult. Thirst reason if I don't have family and friends I feel the lonely. Other reason that is difficult is the food it is many different also the treatment with the people change. The next difficult are the seasons by the change of the temperature. Other it is the housing when I is life with people that I don't know the next reason is the transportation the lack of knowledge of the routes and the schedule . Living in the other country it isn't easy.
