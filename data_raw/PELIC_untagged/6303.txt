First of all I think I'm that type of person who enjoys to analyze other people and herself. Based on what people that I've met throughout the time normally say I believe I'm that kind of person who's normally considered to be an extrovert. Say I'm in a group where I know everybody fairly well they're people whom I've met long time ago and with whom I've interacted a lot. In that case I tend to speak a lot and I try to take the floor at every moment I get the opportunity to. I'm pretty sure everybody who knows me will be able to confirm that. On the other hand say I'm in a group full of people that I've just met. In that case I tend to be shy at first however as soon as some people that I begin to like open up to me I'll start talking a lot. People that I've met fairly recently will be able to confirm that. In both cases people to whom I've talked notice that I never get tired or want to leave the party. I guess that this characteristic of mine which never gets unnoticed is one of the things which make people like me
