From my perspective of view there is no definite answer. On one hand we should stop using chimpanzees for medical experiments. It is obvious that the experiments are inhumane and painful. On another hand unfortunately sometimes we really have to use chimps and developing treatments for Hepatitis B or C and HIV is appropriate example for me. I think we have to find some compromise in this problem. May be using chimpanzees for these experiments only in absolute necessity could be good solution.
