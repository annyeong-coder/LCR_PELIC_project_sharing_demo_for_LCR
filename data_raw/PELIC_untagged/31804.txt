Last summer I came back to my country for four months. In our tradition if the person come back to the country every family will invite her or hem to the party which include buffet. Since I missed our traditional food I ate a lot of food. I I should have watched what I eat but I didn't. As a result I increased 7 kg on my wight. I should have known my wight while I was there. Besides I should have exercised.
