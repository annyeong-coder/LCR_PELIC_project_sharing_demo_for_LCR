After I graduated I had applied for many jobs that I liked. One of them was my dream career. But on the interview date I did not show up for the interview. Because I thought that I wasn't ready and confident enough for the interview. Since then I always think that I should have shown up for the interview. I shouldn't have ignored it because the chance would be 50 50 instead of nothing. I could have been a flight attendant by now instead of waiting for another chance which I don't even know when because it's occasional open like once a year once every three years or once every five years. You can't predict when it will open again.
