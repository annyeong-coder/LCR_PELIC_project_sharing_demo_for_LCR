My country used to be a safe place but now is insurance because is a lot of theft there. I used to see a lot of houses but now I see a lot of buildings. I used to meet with my friends at night in squares but now we meet in a house or in a bar. I used to listen music in the street but now I listen music in my house. It used to have a few plants but now it has got a lot of plants and trees. My country didn't use to be noisy and it didn't use to be hot.
