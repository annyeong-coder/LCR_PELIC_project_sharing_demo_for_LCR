My small and sufficient living room. I spent a lot of time to create it under concept Small and Sufficient. It is very challenging me because I have many option the picture mork up room on magazines to choose. Finally I choose one that clairfy the room batter than the other ones. When you open the main door you will see the large window in the black wall. Under the it has a tiny air condition. On the right of the room it provides a green sofe bed and directly in front of it is a set of TV and DVD player. Beside of TV is lined with bookcases. Next of the bookcases is my desk. I always stay in this room all day because it does not too big to find out everythings that I need to use to do homework and relax after class finished.
