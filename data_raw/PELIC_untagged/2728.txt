Before I began living in Pittsburgh I had been living in Nagoya Japan. Before my husband decided to go to Pittsburgh I had been working as a kindergarten teacher. After he started to apply for visa to enter the U. S I stopped working. When my husband told me about moving to Pittsburgh I had never known where Pittsburgh was in the U. S. So I was a little bit worryed about my life in the U. S. But My husband and I found in the magazine and by the internet that 2 of my husband's classmates at high school had already lived there and started to work at UPMC. When we had known about it we were so glad and It made us relieved. After we decided to move to Pittsburgh we had been saving money. My husband came here without any sponser so we could survive during our first year in Pittsburgh thanks to our saving. We didn't need to buy some small things to live here because by the time we arrived in Pittsburgh our stuffs sach as kichen goods bath goods clothes and stationery had been shipped to my husband's friend's apartment.
