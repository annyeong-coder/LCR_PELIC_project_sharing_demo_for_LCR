In order to survive in the restaurant business. Many preparations and planning is necessary. Such as advertisement money management employee hirement food price and rules. The owner of Uundergrad Grill tom Higgins. However did not meet any of those requirements. He is wrong while he prepared his business. He has many damage. Fist of case before the restaurant is built the owner has to consider with money management. But the undergrad grill's owner didn't consider it. He spent much money for his business for the renovations and painting. Due to he didn't have enough money when he were on the point of opening for restaurant. It's worth all the renovations. If the restaurant will be busy so he will be successful with his business. Another case is menu is too expensive. There is near from Benson University. So he expected to coming to many people at his restaurant also he choose it which a great location. But menu is expensive consequently most customers are above visiting his restaurant. Food price is important for customers. Such as Entrees of menu is very expensive and soda is too then other restaurant. He has to consider what most customers are students. The students don't have enough money. A third cause is too many rules and no professional cooks. Some people prefer take out. Sometimes most people don't have enough time. So they will want to take out. Also the restaurant's life is taste. The professional cooks are worth cooking. If the restaurant's foods are good most people spread for the restaurant. Therefore they don't need advertising. I think the most important thing is the taste. They must hire professional cooks. Therefore they will be busy and will earn much money.
