My worst meal experience was about three years ago when I went to a Shanghai restaurant with my husband on Chinese Valentine's Day. Because my friend told me that restaurant was very nice we decided to have our Chinese Valentine's dinner there. After arriving there we found the decorations and the atmosphere were very romantic. That made us very happy. After we sat down and began to look at the menu the waiter recommended their Valentine's meal to us which included four dishes and two fried rice. It might be due to the music and the air though I seldom received waiter's recommendations I still ordered a Valentine's meal and two orange juices. After a while the waiter brought a big salver on which there are four saucers of food. There were four different kinds food in those saucers some fried tofu some spinach some chicken and a little of noodle. He told us those were the four dishes in the meal. We were totally shocked because we thought those were the appetizers. However the worst thing was following. When the waiter put two bowls of rice on the table I found I was able to count how many grains of rice are in the bowl! As a result we were both very hungry after this sumptuous Valentine's dinner and had to cook by ourselves after we went back. Having had this experience I think I will never order so called Valentine's meal or Christmas meal.
