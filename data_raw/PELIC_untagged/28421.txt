My childhood bedroom was great and has a lot of memories which I really like also it's remind me of my little brother who used to share the room with me. My bedroom was painted with a dark blue which its the color I like and the white color whose my brother prefer. However we were sleeping in a 2 floors bed and my brother who I share the room with used to sleep above me and sometimes he makes noise which makes me really annoyed and awake all night. After a while my father decided to buy a separate beds where we can sleep away from each other without any noise.
