If I were able to travel to any country I would go to France. They live in a beautiful country with beautiful places. If I had to choose only one city I would go to Paris. It is such a magic city. If I were there I would visit the museums and the parks. Furthermore If I knew French I could live there. And the most importante I need have resources so if I had a lot of money I could travel around the whole country.
