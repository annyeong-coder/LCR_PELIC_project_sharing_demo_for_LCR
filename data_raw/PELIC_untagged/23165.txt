ANON_NAME_0 Teaching Styles I had two teachers whose teaching styles are different in last semester of ELI. One teacher taught student to be relaxed to learn whereas the other teacher taught very strictly. Classes of the teacher who taught student to be relaxed are easygoing constantly. In the classes there were lots of games to practice what we had learned and there were not a lot of quiz. Most students could adapt to the class easily and like the teacher and the teacher's way to teach thus students could enhance English efficiently even if they didn't feel like that they do real study hard. On the other hand Classes of the teacher who taught strictly are challenges every day. In the classes there were a lot of additional quiz even if there were important tests which other student had. And the teacher didn't give time to student to talk anything that isn't related to the class. Some students had hard time in every classes of the teacher. But Students could enhance English efficiently as they work hard. The ways of teachers were different but there were not differences for student to learn.
