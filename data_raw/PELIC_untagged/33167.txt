A marathoner have had a heart attack while he was running with others in distance race. The story was began when people wondered whether the prolonged strenuous activity like that race could have a negative affect on athletes. For instance heart muscle damage and if so why it should not gave those athletes the possible protection from such physical or medical problem. Thus many studies have researched the summary of two of them was published in an article at NEW WORK TIMES Is Marathon Running Bad for the Heart by GRETCHEN REYNOLDS May 23 2012. One of the study was published last month in The American Journal of Sports Medicine by Dr. Julius Cuong ANON_NAME_0 an associate professor of emergency medicine at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and the other one published in January in The New England Journal of Medicine. The first study gathered publicly available data on participation in and deaths during or immediately after every known marathon race in the U. S from 2000 to 2009. This study's outcomes discovered that a total of 28 people died during or in the 24 hours immediately after a marathon most of them men and primarily from heart problems. Dr. ANON_NAME_0 said Our data shows quite strongly that marathon running is safe for the vast majority of runners and I suspect that for many of the runners the activity saved them from suffering a heart attack that might otherwise have been brought on by an unhealthy lifestyle . The researchers of the second study found 59 cases of cardiac arrest during a half or full marathon 51 of them in men and 42 of them fatal. The average age of the affected racers was 42 and an overwhelming majority of them were approaching the finish line and the final three for the half when they fell.
