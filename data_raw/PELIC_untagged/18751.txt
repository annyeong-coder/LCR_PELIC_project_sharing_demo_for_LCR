Oh when I took a part in ELI activities or my sharing in ELI activities gave me good chances to share the students and the teachers in many activities and of course those sharing gave me chance to develop my English language by speak with them by the English language. Also when I shared in ELI activities I saw many things I didn't see them before and I learned many new things I wasn't knowing them before.
