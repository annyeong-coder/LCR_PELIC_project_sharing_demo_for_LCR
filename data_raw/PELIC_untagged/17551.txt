British merchants established a trading post in Singapore in the early nineteenth century. In 1965 the newly independent island state was cut off from its hinterland and so it set about pursuing. Towards the end of the twentieth century the government realised that due to limits on both the size of the country's workforce and its land area its labour intensive industries. Singapore's current economic strategy is closely linked to land use and development planning. Much of the environmental provision for example golf courses recreation areas and beaches is linked to the prime objective of attracting business. In conclusion the economic development of Singapore has been very consciously centrally planned and the latest strategy is very clearly oriented to establishing Singapore as a leading 'world city'.
