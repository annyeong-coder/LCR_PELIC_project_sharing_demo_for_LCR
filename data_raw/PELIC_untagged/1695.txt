Classifying people helps us understand that there are many different types of people from ourselves. In many cases we face with unexpected misunderstanding which is caused by different ways of thinking. Because we tend to think or judge something only based on our own ground. According to the test my personality type is ISTJ Introvert Sensor Thinker Judger which stand for the initial of each personal category. First I am closer to introvert type. Sometimes I really enjoy gathering with people whom I don't know before. However I easily feel tired and more comfortable at home. Second I value experience above everything else. For example I have learned English since I was middle school. Nevertheless I couldn't have self confidence to make conversation with native speakers in my country. After the time when I came in U. S. I have to make conversation with native speakers for my living. It doesn't matter anymore to talk with native speakers now. Third I am a person who have strong tendency to make decisions objectively. I don't care much about other people's feeling or emotion. Finally I like to predict what would happen next. Strictly speaking I enjoy changes which are made by my decisions or choices. I don't prefer well organized plan and environment. I think that this personal category could be changed depending on my circumstances which I face with. It is very difficult to judge someone as a single personality type. Nevertheless it is very meaningful to know that there are 15 different types of people from mine.
