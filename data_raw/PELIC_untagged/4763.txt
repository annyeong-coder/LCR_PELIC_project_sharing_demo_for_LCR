My best friend is Muhsin. He is from Saudi Arabia but now he lives in Bahrain because he is teaching there. He studied math at the University of King ANON_NAME_0 in Saudi Arabia and he graduated in 2006. Right now he is a math teacher and has been teaching for one year. He likes his job and he is working on his master's degree. He and I have our relationship. He was my neighbor and we were friends more than for 10 years so we had a careful childhood for example we often went out together. We were studying religion together in the mosques for three years while we in high school. Also we were studying together some math courses at the University of King ANON_NAME_0 and he was continuing his major but I stopped and I didn't continue my major because I got the scholarship to come to the US . Also when we lived in the same apartment we were studying. We taught a special class for free so many people in my city liked it and now they miss us when we were went out of my country. I choose this person because I had a good childhood with him we still help each other and we often have similar ideas. Maybe when I will have a son I will name him Muhsin.
