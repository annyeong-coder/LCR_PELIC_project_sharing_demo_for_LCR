Chile is a long country with beautiful and invaluable landscapes from the northern Atacama Desert to the southern Patagonia. This is the cause for hundreds of touristic arrivals every year. In consequence many regions have touristic industry as principal income source and many Chileans obtain a cut of the profits becoming of little enterprises such as hotels outdoor sports and travel agencies. I think it would be a good thing if tourism were to double in the next 20 years not only due to the obvious increment of money people would net but also because we would value our natural resources in the way deserved. Nowadays both big businessmen and politicians are not conscious of the importance to preserve our landscapes and they are expanding industrial activities to touristic places ruining the environment. So having a high increasing in tourism could be with a good solution to earn money and save our pristine lakes green forest and animal diversity.
