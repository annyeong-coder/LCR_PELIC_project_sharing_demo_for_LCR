My life has a big change. I have already lived in my hometown for 19 years. I have watched TV show SHAOER for 7 years it's very popular at that time. I have gone to school by bus since 1999 many students went to school by bus as same as me. And I have had short hair for 12 years but now I have long hair. I have already learned English for 6 years but now I still study English. I want to study drive car but I haven't learned to drive yet. I have already been an international student and lived in dormitory room now I haven't to rented house yet but I plan to rent house in the year ahead.
