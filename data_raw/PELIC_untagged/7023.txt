I have some friends who are living in Pittsburgh. One of these friends whose husband has been living in U. S. For 8 years speaks English very well although she came here several months ago. She often invites her husband's friends who are good English speaker to her house and she is always trying to improve her English. In addition she likes movies which are made in U. S. And she memorizes the words which are spoken in the movie. Another friend who is Japanese likes playing golf. She sometimes plays golf with native English speakers and it's a good way to improve her English. Now I have no friend who is a native English speaker yet. I would like to make many American friends and talk with them.
