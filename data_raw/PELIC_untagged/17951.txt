I agree about the quotation that the best mirror is an old friend. This means that we can know ourselves when we see old friend who have been together long enough to know each other well. In my case my childhood friend whose name is Mamiko is very similar to me. Mamiko lives in Nagoya which is also my hometown. We are moved from joy to sorrow by same situation. I can very much understand that she is feeling depressed. We do not have to discuss our feelings with each other because we usually know what others feel.
