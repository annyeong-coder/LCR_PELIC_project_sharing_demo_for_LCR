About eighteen months ago I came to Pittsburgh with a lot of projects. But first I should have known about what I needed to do to make real my dreams. Second I could have taken my boards and then traveled to Pittsburgh and applied for a fellowship. Now I have spent almost sixteen months to preparing and taking these exams and I don't have a position right now. On the other hand I should have applied for a position without my exams to get an institutional license and then started the fellowship. Then if I had known that my marriage was going to end I would have saved money to live in my own apartment. Sometimes that is very difficult to know or understand but this is life and things happen. I should have taken an other way and probably my life would have been different.
