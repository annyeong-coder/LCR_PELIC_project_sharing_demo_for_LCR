I think not to disclose too much personal information is very important to protect a privacy. If you tell about your personal information to others they can use it in wrong way. They can release your information without your permission. I don't think to spend time getting to know someone is valuable. If you meet a really attractive person you can make an appointment with him or her outside. In addition if you spend too much time to chat on online you'll be addictive to online dating. We have to be aware. Actual life is more important.
