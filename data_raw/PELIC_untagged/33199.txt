I have studied studied two foreing languages. Now I am studying english at ELI. I have read the books and I have made the homework correctly. I have practiced at home also. I have seen american movies to improve my listening but I have never heard the radio. I have understood grammar tenses but I haven't memorized phrasal verbs very well. My english has really improved since I moved to Pittsburgh.
