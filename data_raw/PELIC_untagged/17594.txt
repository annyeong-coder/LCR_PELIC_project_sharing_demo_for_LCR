As a result of having a huge amout of money from a lottery. I will have the opportunity to do a lot of things helping people my family and my self. Since I have more them 30000000 I will think directly to help the poor people by one third off it by dirct donating or providing self work programs. I will help my family by the other one third so they can pay my younger brothers private school fees. Finally as every body know the prices in the US are increasing every day. Therefore I will keep the rest of the money to pay for my studies expanses.
