On February 20th 2012 I and my friends made a time capsule for our memories. I decided to put some kinds of fast food that we used to eat. Also I put several coins and a little money. One of my friends put a lot of seeds that when it becomes rice. He also put some pictures that their family pictures. Another my friend he tried to put his bike and baseball gloves. And he wanted to put more his stuff but there were no space anymore. After that we closed the time capsule and put under the White House.
