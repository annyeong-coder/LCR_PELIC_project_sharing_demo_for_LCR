Several years ago I would have said vacationing with friends is more enjoyable than vacationing with family but now that I'm married I would spend vacation with my family. My family has become more important to me and I want to share more memories with them. However many people criticize it. I'm going to contrast as well as compare between vacationing with family and with friends in terms of advantages and disadvantages.
