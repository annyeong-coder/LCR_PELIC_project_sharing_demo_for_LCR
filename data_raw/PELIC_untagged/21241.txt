Having a great dream I do my best to achieve it. When I got my master degree in Accounting I was so happy. My dream to pursue a PhD in Accounting becomes nearest to reality. Then I got the scholarship. After I got it I did all the procedures such as visa official copies etc. To come to the US. Traveling thirteen hours is so hard and boring. As I has my dream will come true I wasn't bored. When I saw Dallas airport I was glad and thankful to my God. Feeling my dream will comes true make me excited. First I studied in the English institute at Duquesne University. After studied there I transferred to ELI at University of Pittsburgh. Studying at ELI I improve my ability to speak English. Spending more than a year with gorgeous instructors is my pleasure. Pursuing my dream will soon be true.
