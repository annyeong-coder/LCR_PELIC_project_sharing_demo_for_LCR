If tourism to mymy home country were double in the next 20 years that will be good thing because anew jobs will be created and that will improve the labor market. But I acknowledge the fact that the goverment in my country doesn't take the tourism as an idustry they are abstract to improve it. I think they should front more money to make tourism as a leading industry. Libya has many historical cities and lacations where yo can see inscriptions that describe the life before 6000 years.
