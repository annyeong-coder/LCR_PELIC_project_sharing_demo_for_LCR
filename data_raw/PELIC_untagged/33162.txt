I read on CNN website an article which was written by Elizabeth Landau about how does music changes our minds and its effects on our lives. The article was published in May 28 2012. It state that because of songs tap into fundamental system in our brines Michael Jackson believed that he was doing a good job when he sang that A B C is simple as 'Do Re Mi. ' Some scientists think that playing music could help changing a one's brine by allowing the brine to think in a way that it did not use to think before. Their evidence moreover is ear worms which are the remembering of some songs' senses even the disliked ones. In Judaism for instance the Torah was set to music as a way to remember it before it was written down and we can understand that action by the study which says taht the structures that respond to music in the brain evolved earlier than the structures that respond to language. The scientists also think that the music has an obvious connect with the pleasure human emotions and its engaging with languages. Source ANON URLPAGE
