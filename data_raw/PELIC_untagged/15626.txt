The environment surrounding children in Japan has gradually changed since the 1970's. The most serious and difficult to solve is a problem of child abuse which can be physical sexual or emotional. Neglect or not providing for a child's needs is also a form of abuse. Most abused children suffer greater emotional than physical damage. An abused child may become depressed. He or she may withdraw from school think of suicide or become violent. An older child may use drugs or alcohol try to run away or abuse others. Therefore child abuse includes a lot of significant and deep rooted problems. Although child abuse has been widely known it is not getting to decrease at all. What are the ways to solve to reduce children who are suffering from abuse The first solution is rescuing and protecting abused children from the assailant as soon as he or she who are suffering from abuse are found. In most cases it would be difficult to rescue and protect him or her immediately because the place who has the authority in Japan is consultation offices for children which do not have any power to take abused children away in force. The action by the police should be needed. At the present time it is not real that the police are deal with child abuse because there are not any laws to be appropriate to take abused children away by the police. The law for that should be established as soon as possible.
