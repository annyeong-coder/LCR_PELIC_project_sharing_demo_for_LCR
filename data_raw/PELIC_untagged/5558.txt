It was last August I went to a Italian resturant with a couple of friends. We ordered two different kinds of pasta and one dish of meet ball. We had a wonderful time at there. The girl who was a little fat was our waitress eventhough the serivces was not very good because she dropped a cup water on our table the water spilled everywhere but we still had a happy meal so I decided give her twenty precent tip. When I left my tip on the table my friends told me that was a little much tip for this kind of service so I took some money back.
