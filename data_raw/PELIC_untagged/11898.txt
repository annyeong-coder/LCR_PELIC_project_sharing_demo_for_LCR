A time whe I lost my wallet or purse. The most interesting thing I can't forget so far was when I was a college freshman. I was in the library to study a couple of subjects which was suppose to be. I had a lot to do and most subject were hard for me so I had to spend much time in studying. After finishing I got back to my house. But I recognized that I droped off my wallet in the library. Although I rushed into the library there was no my wallet there. In my wallet there were a lot of cash some cards and lots of things. Lots of cash were important for me but many of the cards were more important than the cash. Although most of my friends told me I could find the wallet but I had been under a great deal of stress until I found my wallet. A mounth later I got my wallet from the post office. Although there was no cash there are all cards I'd had in the wallet. I thoungt it was better than no cards in my wallet. Anyway this experince makes me sick until now.
