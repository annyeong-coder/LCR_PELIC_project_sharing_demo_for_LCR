My apartment is really convenient. There is a big supermarket near my home close down at midnight. Also it is close to my husband's lab. Before we moved here we looked up it on the internet by these two points because we haven't bought a car yet. Sometime we go back too late but we don't worry about that can not buy some necessary groceries for cooking. However this area is little noise. There is a railroad behind my apartment and many cars pass through the Center Avenue street in front of here. I often wake up by the noise of cars or trains during my sleeping especially in summer without closing the window. So I want to pick out a quiet place to move when we pick a car up.
