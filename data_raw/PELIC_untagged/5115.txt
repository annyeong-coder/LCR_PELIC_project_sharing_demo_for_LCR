MY Website I am from Saudi Arabia. I am working at Ministry of Interior. I've been living in United States since January 2007. I graduated from University on 2002. I have a bachelor degree in Electrical Engineering. I've been studying English since I came to USA and I've got a lot of skills so I am working hard for TOFEL. I love traveling so much so I have been to different country like France Germany England Austria Switzerland and Melissa. I love communicating with my friends but I haven't seen my friends this week yet. My favorite a activity is soccer and I've played soccer two times this months. Finally I am happy for being me here in USA and I will do my best to get my Master Degree.
