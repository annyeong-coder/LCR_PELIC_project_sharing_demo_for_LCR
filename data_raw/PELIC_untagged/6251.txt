My favorite musician there are many celebrety musician in this worldwide . One of them called Al Andaleeb Al Asmar but his real name Abdull Haleem . First of all he is from Egypt . Next he got his fame from public love . And I think al the arabian world love this genius musician . Second beside that he is also wonderful composer . He wrotes many beautiful poems . Also he was singing in many celebrates around the world . The next essential thing was his sound . He had a very strong voice makes the people sit to listen to his song . Also his songs isn't lovely its slow .
