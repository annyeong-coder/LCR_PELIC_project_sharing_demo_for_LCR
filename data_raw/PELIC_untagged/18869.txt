There are millions of homeless people living in the streets and parks. I'm sorry about seeing This sight in any countries. Almost homeless people is fired their job. They can't afford to living in thier own home. But I think they have ability to work. They just avoid working. If They have mind to living their home they might work even though the work is hard work. For them who tired of working mentally Government and many volunteers offer to rest in warm place. In the place volunteers offer warm food and place where they can rest and sleep. If they have healthy mental and body volunteers encourage them to work. Then Many homeless people appreciate helping them. They may decide to work to out place. Later They will want to buy their home. The number of homeless people will decrease.
