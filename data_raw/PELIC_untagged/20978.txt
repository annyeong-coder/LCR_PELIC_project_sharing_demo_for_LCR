Puerto Piramides is the most interesting city I have ever visited. It has the most beautiful view in my country. You can see a sea in front of a large mountain. It is located in the Peninsula of Valdez next to Trelew. Puerto Piramides is smaller than Trelew but is cleaner than it. I think is the quietest city in South America and it is the best city for diving in Argentina. It is as old as Puerto Madryn but it is less crowded than it. Because the whales go there every October it is as famous as Buenos Aires but it is safer than Buenos Aires. Puerto Piramides is an interesting city and is more friendly than Trelew but it is not as international as Trelew. In additon you can do a lot of sports in this city so is more exciting than the other one. To conclude I think Puerto Piramide is the best city in my country and you should visit it.
