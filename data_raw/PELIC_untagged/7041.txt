My best friend who is five years older than me has different characteristics from me. For example he is very quiet but I am talkative he likes staying in home but I like outdoor exercise. I did not think we could be friends due to ages and sex. However there is a age gap between us we can be best friends. He is also a friend who can give you true advice and accept what the way you are. The first time he caught my attention was in a research laboratory. His group used to finish their task quickly because while finishing the task you could leave the laboratory earlier. I wanted to leave the laboratory earlier therefore I asked him for being a member in his group. He was very shocked to receive this asking but he still accepted. After being the member in his group I was not only doing research with him but he is also a person whom I was studying with. Beside studying he is a person who likes singing just like me. Singing is the second part in our life. It is difficult to describe what his personalities are but you can know him by getting along with him.
