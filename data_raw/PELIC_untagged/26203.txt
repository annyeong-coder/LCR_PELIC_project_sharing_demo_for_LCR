You should tell him your feelings. Then together you could have a serious discussion. You ought to ask him if he loves you and wants you to be with him. You should try to have other opinions or points of view. You could for example ask your friends guys or girls what they will do. You should not take hasty decisions unless you are sure. For example don't quit your job if are not sure to find another job in Minnesota. You could ask in your office if they are branches in Minnesota. If yes you should join him and see after if it will work. If no don't quit your job and move there without looking back. You could suffer from it later. If there isn't any possibility you should try to forget him and find another boyfriend.
