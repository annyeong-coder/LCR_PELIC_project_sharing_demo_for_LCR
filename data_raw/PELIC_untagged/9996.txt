In Taiwan one of the most serious environmental problems is air pollution. Due to the promotion of economic growth more and more factories were built. They produce so much exhaust that air pollution has become worse and worse. On the other hand too many cars and scooters also contribute to the problem.

There are still several other reasons for causing air pollution however these three reasons are the major culprits.
