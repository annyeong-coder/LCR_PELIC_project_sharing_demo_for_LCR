First I wanted to go on a trip. I came to Pittsburgh only 1 month ago. But I already have taken a trip to other state ''Georgia' with ELI friends and teachers! Second I wanted to meet American friends. But I haven't met any yet because there aren't Americans in the ELI. But soon I'll meet an American friend through the conversation partner program in the ELI. Third I wanted to master English. But I haven't done it because I have been living in the U. S only 1 month! I'll master English someday.
