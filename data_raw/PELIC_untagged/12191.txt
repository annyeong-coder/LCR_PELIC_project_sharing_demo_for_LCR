Sometimes hard work is not rewarded There are many advantages and disadvantages for hard workers. First of all the most important thing is money I think. If somebody workes more than 12 hours a day with a good salary that is will be satisfied and he or she will be happy. Some times hard work is not rewarded. People work 12 hours a day with fewer salary I mean is not enough for life needs especial if they are married so they have to offer money for thier families. Hard work is not usually mean work many hours a day but it may be fewer hours but may very dangerous and need a lot of thinking for example surgeon when start his operation may it will take from him just few minutes but if he make a mistake that will lead to very dangerous complications. Any how this is life and we have to adapte every thing to be life smooth passing and easy going.
