It is obvious that downloading from the Internet is a wrong thing. The first reason that makes me think about that is when people download a video without paying for it they take someone else effort. For example when I download movies or TV shows from the Internet I make the company lose a lot of money. The company will face a lot of problems such as no one will see the film in the theaters and that's will effect the company budget. Moreover without any profits the company cannot pay any thing to their actors who spend a lot of time to act. The second reason that makes me think that downloading from the Internet is wrong is when someone download a program from the Internet with a jailbreak they steal someone else copyrights. For instance when people download a program that worth 20 dollar for free they will make the person who invent this program to lose a lot of money. Maybe the person who invents the program spent all his money and his time on this project and people reword him by stealing his work. People who think that downloading from the Internet should be for free they have many reasons. One of the reasons is they say that when they download for free they save money. For example instead of going to the cinema and paying 10 dollars to watch a movie they download it from the Internet for free. Also they say that downloading from the Internet could save time.
