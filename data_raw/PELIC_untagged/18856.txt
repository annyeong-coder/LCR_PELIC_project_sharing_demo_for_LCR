Obesity problem is significant in many countries. A lot of people are overweight. There are several ways to express the problem. First of all people are easy to buy fast food. It is convenient and cheap however it is high in fat and sugar. In addition people couldn't afford to do some exercise. So we need to think about teaching the real concept. First we need to educate people about the healthy eating habit. More vegetables and fruits are good for their bodies. Second the government should make kids do more exercise at school. If the kids enjoy exercising they will keep the habit.
