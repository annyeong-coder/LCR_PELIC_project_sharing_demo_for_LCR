Self help is the best help I think it is true . Always if I have some problems I try to solve them by my self because I am the only one who know reasons of this problems . Usualy I dont want any help from ather people because I want to depend on my self and I should to work to get good results after I solve any tricks or problems . I dont like some people to depend on others to solve prOblems although they have ability of solve these problems . There are more approaches to help our self for example training reading more informations from social carrying websites learning more steps to find mistaKes and correct them . . . Etc. We have a lot of time to build confidence in our selfs to apply this sentence Self help is the best help without to need others.
