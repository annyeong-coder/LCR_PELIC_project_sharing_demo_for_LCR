The important relationship to me was meeting with professor ANON_NAME_0 who was in EE department at PSU. I met him when I got PSU for my maters study in 2002 fall. One professor from Korea introduced professor ANON_NAME_0 to me. It was very precious meeting for me because professor ANON_NAME_0 was not only my mentor in school but also kind elder at out of school. Since 2002 we have been keeping our relationship so far. When I was even sick while staying at PSU his family kindly took care of me with their sincere heart so I am never going to forget his favor toward. I didn't know how to thank his family enough at that time but now I appreciate his kindness and willingness toward me with all my heart.
