Hi everybody. I come from China. My name is ANON_NAME_0 Bao. Some of my friends call me Bao bao because that is how my initial sounds in China. My first name means pure. It is meaning of the expression pure in heart . My husband is working in University of Pittsburgh and I am studying English here in ELI program because I want to attend graduate school. Now I'm living in Squirrel Hill. My hobby is cooking. I feel happy to cook delicious food for my family and friends. I hope I can do my best in my life.
