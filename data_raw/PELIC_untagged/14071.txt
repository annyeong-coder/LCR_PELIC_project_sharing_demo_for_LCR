Dammam and Pittsburgh Living in two different cities is one of the most interesting things I have been through. When I came to Pittsburgh I found many differences and similarities between Pittsburgh and my hometown Dammam. People who have lived in two different cities can learn many things and more than people who have just lived in their own city. However there are differences such as beach weather and the bridges. And few similarities for example the size location and both cities are industrial cities. First of all Pittsburgh and Dammam have a lot of differences such as the area they are in also the weather they have. For example Dammam has really hot weather in the summer and a nice weather in the winter but Pittsburgh has really nice wither in the summer and so frigid in the winter it is like the opposite. Also Pittsburgh has a lot of bridges but Dammam has few bridges because there are no rivers in my city. If you take a look at Pittsburgh you are going to see many mountain but Dammam is a coastal city which has a beach. However Pittsburgh and Dammam have a lot in common such as they are located in the same region which is in the east side of the country. In addition Dammam has a lot of oil which made it an industrial city also Pittsburgh is one of the most industrial cities in U. S. A. However Dammam is about the same size as Pittsburgh and they both have about the same population of about three million. I think living in two different cities is learning something new in your life while I'm living in Pittsburgh I realized that I'm learning many things than I have expected. With all the differences in both cities it was difficult for me to live with new society that I had to live in. However it is a good opportunity to meet new people.
