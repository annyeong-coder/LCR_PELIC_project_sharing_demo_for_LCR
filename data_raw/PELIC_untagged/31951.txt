List see a lot of stars people sea dark sky hear wave sounds smell remained smoke touch sand is cold breeze feel uncomfortable lonely Title A night at the beach In the beach at a night I can sense many things without eyes. When I go on a visit to the beach at night sometimes I can only see dark sky. I cannot see any person and any sea. However I can sense a lot of things without eyes. I can hear wave sounds. This causes me to relax which is comfortable for me. Second it is breezing. I can smell remained smoke. Someone performed campfires before I come to here. As there is no person I can imagine its scenery by closed eyes. When I leave off my shoes I can also touch the sand. It is already cold. It is uncomfortable for me. The sand is taking my energy and temperature. I require a blanket. At the last I can just feel lonely. In conclusion in the general life we often identify the environment through the vision. However you can aware a lot of things via other senses.
