My husband often tells me some funny stories from his student life. I don't know Whether or not it's true but he tells me that all happened in the past. The most funny stories That I remember accord on April Fool's Day. At that time my husband lived in a student hostel That was in a small town near Moscow. At late night on the first April he and his friend colored someone's window by a black paint and a poor guy in that room was sleeping during 24 hours because he didn't know If it was day or nighttime. Ones my husband and his friends have put a metal rod on the train rails and thus shortened electrical circuit in a rail road traffic light. Due to that red light was always on and a train That was coming at that time has weighted green light for couple of hours. At those times my husband was an undergrad student and liked same funny jokes.
