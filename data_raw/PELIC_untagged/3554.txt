March 26 2007 Dear father Hi how have you been father I've been good. I need to discuss something with you. I've found two cars that I want to buy recently but I can't choose one of them. One of the car's name is M6 convertible and the other one's name is M5 sedan of BMW motors. First the M6 car price is more expensive than the M5 but in my opinion it's not necessary for me because both cars are nearly the same price. Second the M6 is a convertible. However another one is just 4 doors sedan which is unable to open the top. I'm supposed that the M5 is more comfortable than the other one. In addition both cars have the same engine and also have the same type of transmission. And the other different thing is that the M6 is a little faster than the M5 and it's lower than the other. I'd like to hear about your opinion. Please send me an answer as soon as get this mail. I already decided for buying vehicle on May 15th at the latest. I love you father. I'll see you around. P. S I really miss you and all family. See you soon.
