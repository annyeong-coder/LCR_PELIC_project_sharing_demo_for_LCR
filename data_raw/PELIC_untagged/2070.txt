The relationships between families are different from culture to another. In this paragraph I'm going to write about relationships in my city Al Qatif. First of all what is a family The family can be defined as a group of people living together and usually consisting of parents and their children or it can be defined as a group of people who are closely related by birth or marriage. For example my nuclear family consists of my father my mother my sister my brother and me. Then on my father's side he has six brothers and four sisters. On my mother's side she has three brothers and three sisters. Also each member of this close family may have other relatives. So we can describe the family as a tree that started long time ago as a seed from God and grew up to the end of the life. In my community all the families are related to each other in some ways because we have close relationship with each other and we married each other. When I walk in the street I mostly recognize all the people walking or driving in that street. So I can say that generally all the community knows each other. That is because all the families share their happy or sad events. For example when one of the families celebrating her son wedding all the neighbors come to help and congratulate the family. In the other hand when something bad happened for example some one died or had accident they go to the family and join the sadness and ask the family if she need help. From that all I can say that my community is all close to each other as one part sharing all the events.
