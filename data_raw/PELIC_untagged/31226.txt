In my opinion we should admit medical experiments on chimpanzees and other primates. My view is based on medical and ethical reasons. First of all the experiments on chimpanzees are still extremely valuable for medical advances. Even now there are a lot of diseases which we can't find remedy and there is a possibility that more urgent epidemic panic will appear as well. Then it is unavoidable to experiment on them to face the threat. The second reason is ethically experiments on chimpanzees have the same purpose as eating animals for living. We are ethically allowed to kill other living things only to live. For the same reason conducting experiments on them should be admitted ethically only when the experiments contribute to the health and welfare of the humans. In conclusion we should partially accept experiments on chimpanzees at the same time it is important to carry out experiments with considering of the purposes and treatments of chimpanzees.
