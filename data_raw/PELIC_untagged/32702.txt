I like my home here in Pittsburgh for one major reason. Because we pick out a nice location near from university. On the other hand I dislike the home because of many reasons. First the landlord doesn't show up until the end of the month to take out the money. Second the wall need to touch up the paint. Third we can't clean up the clothes because there is no indoor laundry. In addition room need more lights. For this reason we bought additional lights to turn on more lights inside the rooms. Moreover I would like to hang up new curtain to reduce light coming from the sun during the day. Also put up air condition will be a good idea during summer. Finally I think we pick out a nice place regardless of some dislike small things.
