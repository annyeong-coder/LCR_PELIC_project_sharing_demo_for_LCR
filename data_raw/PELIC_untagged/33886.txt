Leaning english in ELI gives me a lot of chances to know the Cathedral of learning and places near the building. First the building is very big and long which gives me a beautiful view of Oakland . For example if I stand up in the last floor I see everything nicly and clear in Oakland . Second the building is closed to the museam where I can learn more about Oakland such as a history of Oakland minerals they found here and atc. Third Cathedral of learning has different departments. For example they a depertment of social workers and English as a second language. In coclusion the bulding of Cathedral is located in a good place where you can expirence a lot of things.
