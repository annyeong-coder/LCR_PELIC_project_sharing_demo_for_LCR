I agree with friends are the most import influence on young adults. I think young adults is young people. I think that they are the most influence is more friends than family. I can give several reasons. First of all they usually spend time with their school. So their relationship is sensitive and curious for them. And They can first lean their relationship of society from school and their friends. Secondly they want to keep communicate with their friends. Even though their parents can be friends that has limited for them. They sometime have their secret wi. But they need that their parent's support.
