Subcultures I think the teenagers in Saudi Arabia are different from each other. There are general groups and every group has one way which is different than the other group. One of groups follows the good way and the second follows the very bad way. In my opinion this group of guy does bad things and does what ever they like to do and they enjoy doing that even if it is bad. The questions hear is why are they doing that I believe they do it because they have nothing to do in life. They don't have work and even if they have work they get a very low salary. I feel they like to do something to make them feel excitement and interest. For instance all of them like to have a good sports car. They always clean the car and polish it themselves once or twice a week and they care for it very well. They always like to drive those cars with high loud music and they always like to have a sound system in those cars. They like to go out all the time. They want to come back with out anyone asking them where are you going or where are you coming from . They like to go for a picnic with their friends till midnight and sometimes they go for a long picnic. For example thy need go to the picnic three days in the desert or in the beach. Most of them start smoking cigarettes. A lot of them think that they are men when they are smoking. I think there is nothing that can stop them! They do every thing they like. In my opinion always this group is irresponsible about anything they want to do. Most of them think that anything they do is always right. Finally I was a teenager once in my life. I will not say in which group I was but this in my opinion about this group of teenagers.
