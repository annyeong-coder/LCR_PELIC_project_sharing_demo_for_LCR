When I was in middle school student I met my friends. I was attending a class when I met them. They suggested me to ride a bicycle after class while we were attending a class. We went to the river when we finished the class. I talked with them a lot while I was riding a bicycle. I recognized that their house is very close to my house when I talked with them. We played together all the time while I was going to the school. They are best friends so far.
