Global warming nobody can imagine how dangerous this problem. It threatens our life day after day more and more. Many species of animals are threatened with extinction such as penguins . The ice in the north pole started to melt. Consequently the amount of water in the oceans increased. Many island are threatened to disappear. Several forests have burned due to the increasing of temperature such as what happened in Colorado few weeks ago. Also many houses are destroyed. Most people are not interested about this problem. It should be our responsibility. So everyone on this earth must be responsible. This is our problem. To establish an organizations to solve this problem is not enough. Governments must work together to find real solutions. For instance people could use public transportation instead of their own car to decrease the air pollution. Factors also must contribute in that by using filters. I am not an expert. However many simple solution can contribute to stop the ozone hole and we do not care about it such as I mention above. We should all work together not to give up.
