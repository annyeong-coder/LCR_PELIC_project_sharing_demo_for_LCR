Graduation is next month! I need to make some plans now because when exams start I don't have any free time what am I going to do when I finish school My roommate is going to take a vacation before she look for a job I can't do that because I need to earn some money soon. I think that after I graduate I am going to take a word processing class. As soon as I'll learn word processing I look for a job as a bilingual office assistant. It's hard to find full time jobs though Part time jobs are easier to find. Maybe I'll take a part time job after when I find a good full time one Or maybe I'll take a workshop in making decisions before when I do anything.
