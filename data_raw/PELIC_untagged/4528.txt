I am an outgoing and positive person. My grandfather gave me the name it means pretty flower . The flower is grown up by sunshine such as I am always bathing in the sunshine. I like to go outside for example go swimming play ball or go shopping. I plan but not restrict my future. What comes to me and I just accept it. I am going to continue my graduated program. Maybe I can't find a job in the United States after I finish my study. I still enjoy my life now and the future.
