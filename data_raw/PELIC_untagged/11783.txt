These differences resulting in the different ways of thinking and life style sometimes provide variety but often become wrong criteria based on biased information and a barrier in building unity. First because stereotypes are made up of individual opinions these stereotypes can provide wrong information. People have tendency to evaluate others by knowledge and experience and theses obtained information play an important role as standards. However stereotypes these subjective standards are based on emotion or personal opinion not fact. Therefore stereotypes people can be biased rather than objective. Second when it comes to a barrier in building unity stereotypes cause misunderstanding. As society changes fast people sometimes cannot have enough time to collect information to understand others such as ethnic characteristics and tendencies. Consequently people use some existing stereotypes taken without filtering in order to judge others. These unfiltered information offers people prejudice although this information is easy to get.
