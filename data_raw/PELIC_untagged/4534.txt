I have been most influenced by my father because he is the most close friend of mine. I was persuaded by father to do exerise and study hard. I was taught by father to value other peole. My values were formed because he always thinking I am the best one. I am still inspired by my father especially by the way he never give up in front of hardship. His infulence can be seen in all of my life he will always be remembered by me for my life.
