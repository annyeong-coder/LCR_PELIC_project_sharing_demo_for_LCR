One year ago I went to Singapore for trip. It was a winter January. I lived in Moscow at this time. This travelling took a long time. All most it was 12 hours by plane. I stayed in Singapore one month. I visited museums for example Changi Chapel Museum Chinatown Heritage Centre and Asian Civilizations Centre. I visited Sentosa Island this is very beautiful island I swamed in the beach. Chinatown Zoo Park Butterfly Park and underwater world in island Sentosa. I took a tour yacht. I did a shopping. I walked a famous street in Singapore named Orchard Street. Singapore it was very expensive. Singapore it was very small country.
