There are huge differences between my home town and Pittsburgh. When I came to Pittsburgh last year I was shocked. The fact that I was chocked is the houses structures and how it is different from my home town. Also what shocked me when I came here was the natural beauty. I was surprised that the trees leaf is change to several colors in the winter. Also what was surprised me is the beautiful weather. But I was shocked that the area becomes white in the spring because of the snow.
