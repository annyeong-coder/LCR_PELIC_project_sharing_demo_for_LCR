When I moved to my home my uncle helped me touch up the walls with new paint. I picked out the new sunblind and set it up. I took some old furniture away and threw them out. I bought a new droplight and hung it up it lighted my room up. I took down the old picture and put up my family's photograph on the wall. When I feel lonely it can cheer me up. Besides I turned my bed around so that I won't face the window. I straighten my room up two times a week because the messy room will bring me down.
