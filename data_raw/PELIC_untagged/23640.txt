That I bought a handbag one day before it got cheaper was my bad decision. I wish I had listened to my sister who suggested I not do that. She told me that the store where I was going to buy the handbag would have clearance next week. I wish I hadn't been so impatient and had waited till next week. Instead I bought the handbag and next day the store advertised sale on my handbag. I was so upset but I hope this is a good lesson and I'll listen to my sister's advice next time.
