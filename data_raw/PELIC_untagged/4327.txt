Well I think my country has more social problems than USA but the poverty is the same in the word. We should star to share the tecnology and money. I suggest teaching people how to use his resources to improve the cality of life. Fight against the political corruption and we need to increase the laws to coruption because they use the money for their interest. I invite them to think about using our money increases the education build more schools perform development plannes thinking in our future.
