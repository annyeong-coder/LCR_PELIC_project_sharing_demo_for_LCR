Hundreds of fish fell into the land from sky I think that there might have several reasons to explain this mystery. First this might have been caused by an unusual weather condition such as tornado through the local rivers or lakes. The strong wind could have swept the fish off and then taken them off to the ground. Second it was a chance to happen that there could have had a sudden earthquake and the big shock might have shaken the fish from the water to the sky then the fish may have dropped to the ground. Finally I think that this mystery might also have been a joke which was made by the visitors from other planets.
