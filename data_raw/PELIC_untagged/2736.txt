My home cheer me up when I go out the U. S. And get back to it I feel happy. That is normal because I meet my family and my friends again. While I'm in my home I hang out with my friends. I also put together all my anniversaries to remember the all the events when I grew up. I don't leave my relatives out I go to visit my grandfather and mother uncles and my aunt. If my vacation is about to get together I feel like someone is trying to tear me down because I have to leave my home again and carry on my study in the United States.
