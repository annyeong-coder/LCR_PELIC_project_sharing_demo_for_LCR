I am originally from Syria and it is a historical country it has a lot of loacations to visit. I have been visiting a lot of them. I enjoy collecting stamps about each country and my cousin has sent to me a lot from here. And then I traveled to russia for studying so I have discovered alot there because it is a very exiting country too. I liked every thing there so I tried to do many interesting things there. I collected alot of russian stampes and I have read too many books about this rich country. And now I wish to now more about USA because I like this country too and I will spend here the rest of my life.
