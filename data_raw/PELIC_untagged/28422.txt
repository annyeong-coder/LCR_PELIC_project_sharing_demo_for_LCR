Everyone hope to have ideal neighbor. The ideal neighbor is reliable and quite person. You trust him when he does anything. He is helpful and able to do what you ask him easily. He is serious when he starts to do important things. When he asks me about something he does that politely. He doesn't come to his home late. He always comes to his home quietly and without loud sound. When I visit him everything in the house is neat and tidy His house isn't messy. He is seriosly worried about my problems.
