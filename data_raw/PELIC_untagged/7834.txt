I like riding bicycle One of my favorite sports is riding bicycle. When I was 16 years old my father sent me a bicycle. From that day I began to like riding bicycle. After I graduated from Beijing Science and Technology University in 1983 I cost two months salary to buy a new bicycle. I went to work everyday. I have a boy. When he was 3 years old my wife and I sent him a bicycle that it was his first bicycle. He enjoyed it. When he was 10 years old he had second bicycle. We enjoyed going outside every week. From 18 to 22 in August 2005 my son and I had finished a long distance travel. It was about 450 miles from Beijing to Taiyuan Shanxi. It cost our 5 days. He was just 11 years old. It was extremely hard for us but it was pleasure for us. I never thought that my son could finish so long distance travel to ride bicycle. This travel should be instructive for him in his life. Of course I had learned a lot from my son. I love my son. I love riding bicycle.
