Title Spring in Lebanon Indent Spring season in Lebanon is like living in Heaven. The sky is as clear and blue as the ocean. The weather is fabulous the smooth wind makes the trees dance and the flower clap and the light rain is like a renaissance for the plants which grow in this season. On top of this you can enjoy walking because the ground is like a long green carpet. During spring because the weather is great the outdoor activities became very popular such as picnic in the weekend associated with tasty barbeque and when the weather is great all the beaches and pools open their doors for visitors who enjoy all water activities specially swimming which very popular in Lebanon during spring and summer time. Spring is better than summer because it's a warm season where the temperature is normal not too cold and of course not too hot. That is why people prefer to enjoy their outdoor activity during spring time. This nice weather has a positive influence on the tourism because tourist can go ski in the mountain which not far from the beach and then when they get bored they can go down to the beach. Spring is the only season which allows people to practice winter hobby which is skiing and summer hobby which is swimming. Of course it's a strange experience for a lot of people to be able to do these two sports and Lebanon is the only place that offers this joy. This gift from God for the Lebanese people was and still appreciated by Lebanese and non Lebanese people and we always try hard to protect it. At the end of this season snow will be gone. I should mention that Lebanon is a very small country that the reason why you can go from place to another in hour or two. For all the reason above I like to go back to Lebanon during this season but the wind doesn't drive always in the way that the ships want to. Spring in Lebanon is the best season ever and of course Lebanon is the place to be from March 22 until June 21.
