I prefer to take a position in a company and work for the company especially at the beginning of my carrier. Because I have to acquire many skills and knowledges that is necessary to make my living. Although we study many things in our schooldays we can't success in our business without enough experience. But In my opinion even if you could get a position in a company that you hoped to work in you have to mind two things. First you have to build a good relationship with your boss and colleagues. Second you have to study hard by yourself while working in the company. I think anyone can't get any skills without an effort however it is sometimes difficult. In my case while I was working in a hospital for one year after graduation of a college I was too busy to study something in my home. I was working for about 15 hours every day and so tired that I was sleepy all day. But now I consider I had to study more at that time.
