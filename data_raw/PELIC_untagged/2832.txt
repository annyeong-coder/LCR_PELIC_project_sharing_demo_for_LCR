Every writer has his her strengths and weaknesses. And im a writer in english I think the big problem that I have is the english is my socand language. So when I write I thing a bout my netive language and I try to translet it to english. So they way I think is not some as an english readers. In addition I don't have an enough words that I can montion my opinions and ideas. However my frist language has a more words and litters. So that made my emotion more huge and deep. And this is one of my strengths. Also I like to read articals especialy for a famuos writers. So that increace my idea and improve my thinking waies.
