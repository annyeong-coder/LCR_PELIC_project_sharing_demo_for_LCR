Dear Members I know that some of you are discouraged because it is taking you so long to run five miles. But don't give up yet. According to our annual records the amount of time it takes for an average runner from our club was decreased from 45 to 30. 5 Minutes during last 8 years. The most significant progress has been achieved during the first 4 years. Meanwhile the time for a typical runner is decreased every year till now. So we make a sustainable progress. I encourage you strongly to keep participating in the work of our running club and hence to achieve new even better results. Your Milla
