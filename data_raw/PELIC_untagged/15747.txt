It was 8 in the morning a phone call woke me up when I was in a deep sleep. When I pick the phone up they ended up. When I went back to sleep the phone rang again. And I answer it however I found out it was a spam. I was so angry that they called me in that early morning. The lady in the phone tried to talk to me but she spoke too fast I didn't understand. Then I asked her to hold on and I went to brush my teeth. After that I said I didn't understand and then she went over it for me. Unfortunately I still didn't understand but she didn't give up and wanted to say that again. But I'm not interesting that product and I asked her to left her phone number and call her back tomorrow morning she reject because the company set up a rule that they can't left personal phone number to customer. And I replied You don't like to receive a spam call too so why you call me After that I hung it up and turned my phone off. I thought that is a good phone experience even that was a spam call.
