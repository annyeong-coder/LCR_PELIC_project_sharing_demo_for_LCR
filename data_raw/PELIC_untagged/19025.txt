I had a English teacher before. She is an American and live in my country. She helped me learn English and made me do the reading homework every week. Sometimes I didn't understand what she talked about. She let me use the dictionary in the class. She never made me feel embarassed. She got me to try to speak English and had me read English hard. I appreciated her teaching me.
