Two a weeks ago I was making shopping when my daughter took the bag of cinamon that I picked up to buy without I noticed that so when I went out while my husband was paying for the things which I buy the police man asked me did you have a receipt at that time I noticed what my daughter did . My husband gave me a list of advice . He said you should have watch her you shouldn't have let her play you ought to have stay near to me so I can watch her also . You shouldn't have take her out of the shop car so she could have taken any thing. I though I might have told him what is happen .
