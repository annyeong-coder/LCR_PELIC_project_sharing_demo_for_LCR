I had a horrible memory in a laboratory room. My major was chemistry so I liked laboratory work. When I was a freshman most laboratory work was easy for me. I wanted to work hard such as Albert Einstein. When I was junior I decided an organic chemistry of my major. When I went to go first time in an organic chemistry laboratory room I thought that Wow finally my dream came true it is really laboratory work it is awesome. However nightmare was coming to me in laboratory room.
