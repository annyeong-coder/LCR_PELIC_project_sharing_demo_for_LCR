Before I came here I had never watched America dramas. By 2006 I had not interested in America's anything. However since I went in Pittsburgh I've watched American TV dramas like a Prison Break and a Lost. By last month I had been watching a TV drama Prison Break. Lately I've been watching a TV drama Lost since yesterday. It's not only to help my English level but also it's fun. If my mother knows this fact she'll surprise that.
