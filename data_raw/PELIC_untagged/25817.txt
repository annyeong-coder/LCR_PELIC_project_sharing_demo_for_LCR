I have always heard about My neighbor who had a difficult life . He grew up in a poor family . His dream was always to become a surgeon but his family couldn't afford his study costs. He believed that he with the hard work he'll be able to achieve his dream . Day after day with the ongoing work he was able to enter the college and begins to achieve his dream . Now he can treat the patients as a surgeon.
