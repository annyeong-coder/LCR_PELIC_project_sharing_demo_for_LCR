Siddiq Meer Grammar 3G Mar 22 2012 Hatem Shafi Today I am talking about one person who has provided me a lots things since I know him. He is professor Hatem Shafi. First of all he has given me good chance to work in his school since 1997. Also he has advised me to complete my study since then. In addition he has encouraged me to memorize Holy Quraan for several years. And he has been like my father since I know him. Next when I completed my bachelor degree he has taught me in university when I was studying master degree. I have been young man since then. But after that I have become important person by professor Shfi. I have could not reciprocate for him since I know him. But always I have prayed for him.
