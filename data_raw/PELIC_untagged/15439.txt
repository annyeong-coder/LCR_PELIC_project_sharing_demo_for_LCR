Thailand is a very famous as a tourism country. It located in southern east of Asia. Bangkok is the capital city of Thailand. It has a lot of nice temple. Also there is a famous night life road called ANON_NAME_0 San it has many good restaurants bars and shops. Actually there is a lot of things to do there especially when every thing is cheap there. Moreover Bangkok has a river which goes in the middle of the city called Jao Phaya . This river has a lot of beautiful big boats which have a floating restaurants and it can take you in a quick trip around however you can travel between cities by this river. In south of Thailand there's a lot of islands the famous one called Phuket Island . It has a very gorgeous beach houses and you can swim dive and eat a fresh sea food. One of my friends told me I think in my country if you love the sea you can go to south of Thailand because it has a lot of beautiful islands . I think Thailand is the exact direction for people who love the nature and modern life in the same time.
