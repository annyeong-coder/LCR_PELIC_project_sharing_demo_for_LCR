I had an interesting experience last April. It happened since my friend was her birthday and she planned to go on a picnic to North park. As soon as I arrived there I met 20 women who comes from 9 countries. It was a marvelous experience because I hadn't had an opportunity people from various ethnic groups in my country like that day. I had never imagined this situation 2 years ago. By the time the picnic ended I've been interested in other countries and various culture. Moreover I take to heart the world is much wider than I thought and we should respect others' life style and cultural differences.
