My best friend who works as a judge in the Supreme Court of Turkey always help me when I am in trouble. His name is ANON_NAME_0. My daughter is also a friend of his daughter whose name is Elif. He is very generous about helping people who need assistance. For example he helped me to learn English. When I went to his office which is in the Supreme Court of Turkey he offered me many things to eat and drink. His colleague whose name is ANON_NAME_1 is very hospitable. In addition ANON_NAME_0 helped me to prepare for an exam that is an entrance exam for my job and that I managed to pass. As a result I appreciate ANON_NAME_0 who lives in Ankara the capital city of Turkey and I am proud to have him as a friend.
