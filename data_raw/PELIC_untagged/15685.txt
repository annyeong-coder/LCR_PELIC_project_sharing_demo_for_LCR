Personally I agree with ANON_NAME_0. Stereotypes comes from what is ture in the group of people which are discribed. Although stereotypes may be unilateral it can give other people an approximative capture since no one is able to know every group of people well. When a useful generalization is outdated or has been negatively changed by some people with power with specific purpose. Old fashioned generalizations always ignore the development of the group and many corrected bad habits.
