Dear Sand Thank you for emailing me. I just want to tell you that right now you are thinking with your emotions not your mind and this might get you in trouble. You should use your logic. Instead of quitting your job and moving to another city you should talk to your boyfriend about your relationship and where the two of you stand. You ought to know how he feels about you before doing anything you may regret later. If there is anything bothering you you have to be honest and talk with him about it. You had better tell him that you need to see him but if you feel that he is pulling away don't force yourself on him. Be prepared to leave this relationship if he does not want you. You seem to be a nice girl and I am sure that you can find another guy who will love you for who you are and no matter what.
