Two differences between Korean and American Since I came to America I have realized that there are many cultural differences which are base on different cultural factors between Korean and American. So I would like to discuss two differences which are American's individual life and working style. First of all American pursue individual life otherwise Korean is more tend to be together. I went to restaurant with American and when we got the receipt that we ordered I thought that we could separate same amount of money for total money. But American started to calculate their own order and tip for each person individually. It looked so complicated and I did not understand at that time. In Korea people go to restaurant and order and share food together. Also when Korean pays their order they just separate same amount of money each person. In addition to usually order people pay for younger people's order and man pay for women's order. Second Korean tend to do as fast as they can American takes their own time enough. At the airport I waited for getting boarding pass. Even though the line was long and many waited staff worked very slowly and carefully each customer. In Korea every thing is so fast so people can not wait long time. Since I was used to Korean working style I could not wait easily. But after many experiences in American life I realized both American and Korean ways to work have advantage and disadvantage. Fast work is not good every times. Slow work can make them more accuracy and customer can get enough care from staff. I have been learning many cultures since I came to America. And I realize that one culture can not judge by different cultures. There are just differences and not right or wrong for different cultures.
