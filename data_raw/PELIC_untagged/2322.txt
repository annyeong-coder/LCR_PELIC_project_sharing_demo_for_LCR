I like to make something to eat in my free time. I HAVE LIKED to eat cookies and bread but I didn't try to make them. These days I'VE BEEN SEARCHING some recipes on internet and TAKING notes some of them. I'VE COOKED since I came in Pittsburgh because my mother usually cooked for me. I can cook soups and some side dishes so I can eat them with rice. Sometimes I make sandwich with salad for my lunch.
