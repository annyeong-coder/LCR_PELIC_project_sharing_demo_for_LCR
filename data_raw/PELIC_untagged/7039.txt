Song and I am a friend since we were in high school in Deagu which is located in South Korea. Although we went to the different university we met every weekends. After we graduated Song who is really good friend like a family became the civil engineer. He has been working about 3 years. Now he got a his own part which is design drawing. He is still learning about a draft however he is going to get his own company which is public engineer works. First time company which is famouns in public works made him work very hard. So I always worried about him. However he never complained and made his career step by step. I really proud of him and I wish his draem which is getting his own company came true.
