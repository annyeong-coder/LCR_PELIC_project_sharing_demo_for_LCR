On new year's day korean people go to their hometown where their parents live. All landmarks which have been famous for food prayer places are also very crowded by people. We share words of blessing with each other that may bring the good fortune during the year. In the morning we eat rice cake soup which means grow a year older in korea. Then we deep bow to the elder members of family who will give to youngers money gift. And after the deep bow elders give youngers some advise that will help youngers to go through a series of hardship from their life.
