What are two effects that the lack of a positive role model could have on a young adult's development Young adults' value and behavior might change from good to bad because they lack of a positive role model. Most people admire someone for example movie star sports player or businessman. People always copy behavior from people that they like or respected. Children always copy their parents' words. For example my friend has a daughter named Fiona. When my friend asks Fiona to eat meal or to take a bath the young girl always says no to her mother. So her mother tells her don't say no to me and then makes her to do something that she doesn't like to do. Once the young girl asked me to give her some chips before dinner. My answer was no. Then she said the same thing don't say no to me that learned from her mother. Teenager and children don't have completely thinking and behavior. They are learning everything from their family friends or people who they saw in past. According to research people who watched violent programs when they were very young. After they became teenager their behavior could be more violent than people who didn't watch violent programs. Those examples are easy to see how children or young adults develop their attitudes and behavior. In conclusion young adults really need a positive role model to lead them toward positive value and behavior.
