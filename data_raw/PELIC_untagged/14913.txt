It was a long time ago. I was traveling from the capital of my country Tripoli to my hometown Zawi. In the highway there was a crowd of cars and the rod was closed. When I arrived to the place where the accident was happened I saw many cars impacted each other. Three people died. The rod was changed to alternative street. This view has not been forgotten. A lesson was being taught from this view that the speed is very dangerous.
