Nowadays a problem has become more and more controversial for people in many countries. The problem is trying to segregate students male and female each other. In other words educational planers want to IMPOSE male on studying away from female. This situation can be different from country to another. In our country Saudi Arabia male and female are separated because of religious purposes. They have their own classes for studying instead to be UNIFIED with male as one class. This point has many advantages for students. First students can focus on their studies instead of looking for sexual things from woman. I can say that male is not ADAPTED to study efficiently with female because of woman's attraction as well as man's attraction to woman. Therefore Segregation gives students an opportunity to have a flow to study in a good environment. However some people dispute this idea. They believe that incorporating male and female can INTEGRATE works of students to be done fast. Cooperation is a very good tool to success with any person. I personally agree with the idea that separation is beneficial for improving education in any country.
