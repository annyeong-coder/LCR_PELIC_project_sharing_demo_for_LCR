Advantages of being bilingal The are advantages of being bilingual in the modern world. Unlike the old world now it is very iportant to have more information to have influence and power. When the people have more education or when they study more their brains are busy. In other words there minds work harder and it is easier to understand other things. Another advantage is that the people who know other languaje can talk and meet more people. Also they can use this ability to search for more specific information on the internet or in books. It is fun when the people learn English because they don't need more subtitles when they whatch a movie. I believe that the most important part of learning other languaje is that your mind is open and your ideas change because you have another way to see things. Now your world is bigger then when you began your studies. All in all in the moderm world we have an advantage when we are bilingual
