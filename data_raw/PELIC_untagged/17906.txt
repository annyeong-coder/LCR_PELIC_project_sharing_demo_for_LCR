Last weekend I was very busy. I woke up very early because I wanted to call my family in Libya. I spoke with my father. I told him I want to speak with my mother he say Hold on amine . He didn't find my mother he says call back after two an hour her outside now . I hung it up. After that I opened my computer to find out some news. I kept on five an hour to watch the move. Suddenly I turned the computer down because my wife speaks with me. In the afternoon I went to buy some goods. I had a good time in last weekend.
