In this video a narrator is talking about Antibiotic Resistance . Penicillin which was discovered in 1928 by Fleming was the first antibiotic that cured human disease. Due to this powerful microbial drug people became over confident to cure diseases. But the advent of bacterial mutation gives bacteria a potent power against antibiotics. So scientists have tried to find the undiscovered antibiotics. This video introduces two different ways to find new antibiotics from the soil. First of all the soil of a park in Vancouver is collected. Bacteria in that soil are isolated and then microbial DNA is manipulated in the lab. Genetically altered microbes are cultured by Robot in the Lab. Small discs saturated with chemicals produced by these microbes place on the colony of harmful bacteria. Clean circle around discs means that harmful bacteria are killed by antibiotics. The second is the soil of radioactive environment in Chernobyl. The scientists are thinking that radiation cause organism to mutate them. So they have a theory to find new antibiotics from bacteria of this area. In conclusion human beings have a big problem by the advent of new and powerful bacteria to resist current antibiotics. So we are necessary for finding new antibiotics to protect us from these super resistant microbes. Finding new bacteria from these two different soils is the example to show us how to find out new antibiotics that can protect us from these antibiotic resistant bacteria.
