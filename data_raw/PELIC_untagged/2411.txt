I think the most important event that affects the tourism is the terrorist attack. For example some people still afraid to visit the United States because of September 11 attack. The other thing is the world war also if largely affects the tourism. The war first affects the country that's in war affects her economy. Then it affects the other countries with relationships with war country. The article stated that the tourist number will increase in the next 10 years. That's will happen when the countries adept their relationships. If not it will be worse than these days specially the economy and the tourism of the countries.
