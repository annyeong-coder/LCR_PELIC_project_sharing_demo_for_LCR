I have an important relationship with an old man studying about language. I met him first time while I was going home after class at las week. He said hello to me first and we kept talking for minutes. He told he knew about Korea very well so we communicated about Korean culture. Before he left he recommended me to practice speaking with him because he said he always goes by that street at that time.
