2 I lived with my parents and my siblings whom you've met. 3 I had two sisters and an older brother I felt a close connection to my sisters. 4 My sisters and I shared a room that we spent nights talking. 5 My brother slept on the living room I hardly ever saw him. 6 It was a large old couch which my father made it. 7 My best friend lived across the hall whom loved her family. 8 We went to the same school where we both studied English. 9 Mr. Robinso was our English teacher who everyone was a little afraid of. 10 After school I worked in bakery in which my aunt and uncle owned. 11 They sold delicious bread and cake that people stood in line for hours to buy. 12 My brother and sisters live far away now I miss them. 13 When we get together we like to talk about the old days when all lived at home.
