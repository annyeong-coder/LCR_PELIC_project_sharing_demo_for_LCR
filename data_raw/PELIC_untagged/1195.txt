The worst experience I have ever had happened when I was a high school student. Actually most high schools in Korea have meal service. Most students eat lunch and dinner through the meal service at their high schools. However some of high schools have very poor meal services. For example while I was in my first year at high school I was using the meal service because it was very convenient. But for the meal service I would have brought a meal box everyday. The worst meal that I had was bibimbob which is one type of Korean traditional foods. Bibimbob should have several kinds of vegetable a fried egg and rice. Before eating it everything in bibimbob is mixed up with a spicy source and soy source. Right after I got my meal I started to mix it up. After a minute I found an eggshell and one hair in it. It was very disgusting. When I found those things in my meal I yelled out. After the accident I started to bring my meal box everyday and I have not used meal service since that time.
