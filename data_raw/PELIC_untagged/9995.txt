When I was an undergraduate student a tragedy happened to me. As usual I went to my school having a lunch with my friends. After that I experienced the importance of a wallet. Usually people keep their credit cards student cards and driver licences in their own wallet. I also kept my valuables in my own one. However I had lost mine while I was unconscious of that. Probably that time is when I had to take a midterm test in my school so I would be in a hurry. When I realized that I felt as if my heart were bursting because of my valuables. I rushed to the lost and found in despair. I almost felt down about them. Finally I found my wallet. Somebody had found it and taken to the lost and found. I had a luck. If I had my wallet delivered to this office my life would have changed. Thus I really appreciated it to the God and a person who sent my wallet. Since then I pay attention to my valuables all the time. Even if I don't be in a hurry I heed what is like my life in any case.
