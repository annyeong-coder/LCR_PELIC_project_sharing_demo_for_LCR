If I won 10. 000 I would take my sister here from Korea to study. I think studying in the U. S is much better than in Korea. In addition I would go to graduate school here. I want to study more. If I won 10. 000 I would take a trip all over the world. In the near future I was suppose to go to NYC for trip with my friend. But she won't be able to make it because of money. If I won 10. 000 I would send some money to my friend for NYC trip. And we would stay in Plaza hotel in downtown. If I won 10. 000 I would invest promising stock or buy real estates in Korea.
