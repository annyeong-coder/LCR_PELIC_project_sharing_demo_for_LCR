I recently sold my car that was the product of buying it mistakenly because it was a cheap car and lasted for about 6 months . I went to the junkyard located in the downtown area. Its transmission was dead thus it costed a lot to repair it then I sold it by weighing though I got more money than I expected. I could have spent some more money to get a better car that lasts longer so it could have been more profitable because repairing the car costs almost the equivalent of how much I paid for it! I wish I had bought a car up to 2500 dollars at least. I wish I had searched the craigslist in details. And I wish I had driven the car some more before threw it away in the bad condition because it was still running even in the condition it needs to be repaired. I would have enjoyed pressing pedal to the metal in any empty area I could find. I love hearing engine noise and feeling it that's why I love F1 racing. I hope that it will happen that I will buy an optimum car in price and condition in the near future. That happening has been a lesson for me.
