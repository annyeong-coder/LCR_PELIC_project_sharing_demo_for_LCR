Aeschylus says Very few people can congratulate without envy a friend who has succeeded. Greek playwright 525 456 B. C. I think a best friend is someone who can reveal everything about herself in front of you. Also you should reveal everything about yourself. If you are her best friend you should accept everything about her under any circumstances. Moreover I think a best friend is someone who helps you when you are in trouble and worries about you as she does for her family. However in fact being a best friend is quite difficult for me. I have many friends who often email me and talk about our problems. If they are in trouble I try to help them. If they are sick I worry about them deeply. However I might have a feeling like envy at her success if she is the only one who succeeds even though I make as much effort. When I think about my sister I congratulate her with all my heart. These two feelings which I have for my best friend and my sister are quite different. If a best friend is someone who makes me feel the way that I do for my family I don't have best friends now.
