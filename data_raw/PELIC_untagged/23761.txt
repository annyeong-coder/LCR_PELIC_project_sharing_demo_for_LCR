I have been liked to eat pizza. In our country we have many kind of pizza but it should be more cheese. In America I can eat different from my country's pizza because I can choose different combo by myself. Also I can buy pizza in the supermarket just baking 15 minutes. It is convince to cook if you don't know how to cook. No. I think that many of the Americans people can cook. They own food basics such as roasting baking and so on. They sometimes use the recipe about different countries food. I know a famous chef in the United States Julia Child was born 1912. All kind of recipes were published by her. Her cookbooks teach a lot of Americans how to cook. At the same time she has a TV show what do the cook steps in the kitchen. She also guides the people to do simply cooking basics. She wants to American people enjoy their meal with their family.
