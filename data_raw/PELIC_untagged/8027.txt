When I was in Japan I sometimes ate 'Sukiyaki' on holidays. We usually eat 'Sukiyaki' when we have a party. In my case I eat 'Sukiyaki ' at my grandfather's house when my relatives get together. When we make 'Sukiyaki' we have to prepare beef onion green onion tofu Chinese cabbage sugar soy sauce and water. In addition some people need a raw egg. We pour the soup made of sugar soy sauce and water into an iron plate. After boiling we put beef and vegetables on the plate. When we eat 'Sukiyaki' some people including me want to eat beef and vegetables with a raw egg. When I was a child I couldn't eat a raw egg but I realized egg could improve the taste of Sukiyaki' and now I can't eat 'Sukiyaki' without a raw egg.
