My room brings me down so I want to make it up. I have some ideas to show it off. I prefer to tear the decoration on the wall down and touch the wall up. I will throw my old chair out and turn my disk around. Also I need to buy hangers to hang my clothes up. I will buy a new lamb to light up my room. Then I should straighten my room up. I am sure this change will cheer me up.
