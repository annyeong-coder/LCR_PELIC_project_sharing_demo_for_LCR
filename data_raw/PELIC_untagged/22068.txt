In both articles Can English be dethroned of Ronald J. L. Brenton and English Seen as Co Star among Global Languages of Randolph E. Schmid you can find ideas in common and others that are completely contradictory. The main aspects in common are two English is the dominant language right now and English is a language that facilitates global exchanges Schmid emphasizes in the virtues of the language in the science field . Nerveless the contrasting points of view of this authors are stronger than their similarities. Brenton underlines that the most spoken languages eventually could eliminate those that are less spoken. Furthermore Brenton affirms that English is growing up and explains the consequences of its linguistic domination and its cultural imperialism. With one question at the end of his article he reveals the fear that English could be ahead of other major languages Spanish German Arabian French . Will English really take over other major languages the author asks. On the other hand Schmid aims to the opposite possibility. He says that new times are obligating English speakers to learn other language and that right now one of five Americans speaks a language other than English at home . Schmid says that it would increase the number of other languages speakers. Schmid also illustrate with graphics that other languages Arabic Hindi Urdu Spanish would increase until reach the numbers of English speakers. He predicts that by 2050 Chinese will continue its predominance with Hindi Urdu of India and Arabic climbing past English among 15 to 24 year olds and Spanish nearly equal to it . I Find Schmid article more persuasive because have more sources and stronger research behind his thesis. Nerveless I still coincide with Brenton when he exposes the risk of eliminate less spoken tongues if these are not teaching at the school.
