Hi I have written this page to let you know some of my hobbies I have grown up in Jeddah Saudi Arabia which is a famous Coastal city. I learned swimming there when I was 3 years old and I have grown up with loving it. I used to swim 2 times a week in the sea. I am interested to be a good diver so I have been learning diving since 1999. Unfortunately since I have moved to Pittsburgh I rarely swim or dive. So now in my free time I'm learning English and trying to review my Turkish language because I don't want to lose it I have been speaking Turkish since 1991. So I really do not want to lose my second language that I grew with. If anyone are interested in the same hobbies send me an e mail so we can be good friends My E mail ANON EMAIL My phone 111 111 1111
