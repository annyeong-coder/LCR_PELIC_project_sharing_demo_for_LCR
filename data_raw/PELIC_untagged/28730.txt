1. When I finish ELI courses I'll register 18 credits next semester. 2. If I were the chancellor I'll allow students enroll credits as much as they wish. 3. Unless I can earn lots of money by myself I won't feed a pet parrot. 4. In case forgetting my appointments in the following weeks I'll make alarms for myself. 5. Because I'm math major I hope I can be a math tutor next semester. 6. After sending my professor an e mail I have got her promise giving me a seat in her class in next semester. 7. As soon as 11 o'clock comes I'll go to sleep. 8. Once Thanksgiving comes I'll eat roast turkey. 9. Before I eat I always have some drink first. 10. Although I got up late I still took the class on time.
