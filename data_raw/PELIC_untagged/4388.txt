My last job was really hard with my boss because he heat one thing that I have always asking him which is asking for a vocation for one day or two day's. The problem getting big and big because I haven't had got all my vocation one time because once I have got my vocation and then later I need to go for a vocation for a day to analyze some small personal business and I couldn't do that. As the policy said I must get my vacation one times all of it. I shouldn't separate my vocation and take the day's that I want. After a while with this problem I figure out that I should quit and find out another job. One I have shouted with my boss to get one day vocation and he refused to give me that day. I went back to my office and I wrote him a resign for my boss and from that day I have got another job which is better for me but instead of quitting suddenly I should have to analyze this problem and come up with a solution for both of as. When I quit suddenly my boss must have calm me down and figure out the problem. With a different boss the atmosphere at work might be better with out any pressure and the employee will work hardly and do his job as he should to do. My boss and I could never work together anymore because I couldn't have done any job under the pressure that I have with him.
