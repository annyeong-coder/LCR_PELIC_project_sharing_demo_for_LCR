My writing habits I start my writing within normal rotten. For example I'm not a formal study place could be on the bed soft chair or on the floor sometimes I writ in very messy surroundings Also the best time for me to start writing is in the evening like I start at 10 00 PM if I didn't take a nap after school. However I usually use a pencil notebook or computer. Whenever I start writing I turn on the heater to get warm environment and sometimes music could help. In conclusion all this things help me to prepare before I start my writing.
