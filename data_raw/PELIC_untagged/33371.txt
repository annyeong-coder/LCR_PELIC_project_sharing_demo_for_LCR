Before I came the US I d never performed in front of the people. One of my friends led to my reputation. At her insistence I won my fame. I had been playing a guitar for my friends to have fun by the time she asked me if I mind playing a guitar for the special ocassion. As soon as she asked me to play for this event I accepted her request. As a matter of fact I was little bit uneasy and hesitate about whether to do that or not. When I got into a room which I did perform the room had already been overcrowded by guests. Finally it happened I played in front of this audiences. After I had received plenty of compliment I felt confident about playing in front of the crowded.
