Last year was my birthday I was 20 years old and my best friend Zuzana didn't come to birthday party. I was hurt about it. She might have come to party. I was waiting for her all day. We were in the garden and I didn't have a phone with me but she should've called me before birthday. The bad thing was that I ought to have reminded her the exact date. She is ver busy she could have forgot about me. One day after she was calling to me but I was very unpolite. I should not have been unfriendly. Now I regret it because she said she had some problems with her parents. I ought not to have thought only about myself.
