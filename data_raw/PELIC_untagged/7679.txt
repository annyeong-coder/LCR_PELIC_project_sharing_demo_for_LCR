THE FIRST MEETING WITH MY FRIEND My best friend is Hatice who lives in Turkey. We met her on the bus six years ago. When I was 14 years old I went to the high school where was so far from my house. I could came home only on the weekends. I looked forward to came the weekends. I couldn't endure to stay at the school campus. I decided to change my school. That weekend when I went to my home. I said my family to want to change my school. But they said me to you can't. Then my family came the bus station to saw me of . While my parents sawing me of at the bus station. I saw her and she was looking at me. After we got on the bus and she sat next to me and we started to talk about everything. While she was talking she was using kind word and she paid attention not to say lie. When we were having a chat I believed that she is the best friend for me and I can stay with her a very long time in the school campus.
