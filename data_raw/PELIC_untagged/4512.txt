I like traveling very much in some ways. First I always enjoy preparing for the trip. It is the most exciting thing to decide my destination. I usually go to a travel agency to get some travel brochures. After that I observe them in my home until I am satisfied. And I choose the most suitable destination for my schedule. With regard to companions I mainly travel with my sister. I feel comfortable with her because we can talk frankly what we really think each other. In my opinion it is important to choose appropriate companions. During a long trip a bad relationship with my companions spoils the trip. Second I enjoy sightseeing. I like to visit historical places such as a castle or park in foreign countries. I always try to visit as many tourist spots as possible. Finally I enjoy remembering the trip afterwards. With looking at the photographs I enjoy talking about our memories of the trip. When I finish traveling and am coming back to my country I actually feel relieved and think my country is the best place for me. But I know I will feel like traveling again in about two or three months. Therefore I am sure I like traveling very much.
