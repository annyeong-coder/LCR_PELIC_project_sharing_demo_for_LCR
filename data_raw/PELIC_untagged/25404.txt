I watched many movies last week none of which were good. One of them was Iron man 2 which is an action movie. I went to this movie because Iron man 1 starring ANON_NAME_0 Downey was amazing. They made this movie in many places one of which were Monaco. I don't like this movie because it's providing some silly moments that made it just longer. The story was weak unlike the first one.
