Could you tell me some news about the first day I thought we have new teacher and maybe we have some homework. Hopefully not please let me know. Thanks! See you soon Have a nice day Winnie Professor Dear Joseph I'm Winnie in your writing class. I was absent on the first day. Would you mind mailing assignment to me I look forward to hearing form you.
