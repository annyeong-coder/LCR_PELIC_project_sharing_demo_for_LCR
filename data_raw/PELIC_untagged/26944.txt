This text talks about how China has found the way to use trash as business. China's economy has improved and grown thanks to the scrap trade with the United States. However it seems complex to the Unites States economy this trade because American people consume more from China than they sell there. I think this kind of trade is beneficial to both countries. On one hand the U. S. Sells all the scrap to China and the other hand China uses it as a recycle resource. Finally both countries make money with trash and improve its economy.
