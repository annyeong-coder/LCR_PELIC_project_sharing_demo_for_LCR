Methods of teaching differ from one country to another . By comparing two big countries as Saudi Arabia and the United States of America we can see a lot of differences between them. The separation between boys and girls in school the way of grading the relationship between the teacher and the student In Saudi they believe that separating girls and boys is better for them. If they are separated they can concentrate more in their studies and for religious reasons too. On the other hand in the States they do not believe in that. They think that if boys and girls study together is better for the student benefit. The other difference between the two countries is the way the teachers grade the students. In Saudi they used to have two exams and few marks for participation. On the contrary in The States most school grades the students on small tests all around the year. When we come to the relationship between the teacher and the student we can see a big dissimilarities in both countries. In the States the teacher usually treats the student as his small brother the teacher tries to let the student love school in any way . In Saudi the teacher and the students relationship is very formal. These are some aspects that differ from one country to another. I see that the methods of teaching in the States are better. They concentrate more on the student and his benefit in these three ways. By letting the boys and girls study together depending on small tests and the relation in the school between the student and his teacher is not very formal.
