Cause and Effect Essay By ANON_NAME_0 Last Name 6 3 2010 Immigration Many people around the world leave their countries and go to live in other countries. Some people attribute the causes of immigration to many underlying reasons but the most important reasons are education safety and job opportunities. The first important cause of immigration is safety. Many people around the world were born in countries that have many troubles so these countries aren't stable and people in these countries don't feel safe or have secure lives. Therefore they leave their countries and go to other places in which they can find security and live in safety. The second important cause is education. People in many countries want to have good education to enhance their lives but they can't find it in their countries because schools or universities in their countries are not good as what they want. As a result they immigrate to other countries that have good education systems such as the U. S or the U. K. The last important cause is job opportunities. People in many poor countries such as African countries or in countries that are over populated like China and India can't find jobs easily or they can't earn enough money. Consequently they travel to other countries that have good job opportunities and can earn enough money so they can live the life that they looking for. Indeed these reasons are the most important causes that reveal why people around the world leave their countries and immigrate to other countries. Often they will find what they need but they will also lose many things they have such as families friends and their home land.
