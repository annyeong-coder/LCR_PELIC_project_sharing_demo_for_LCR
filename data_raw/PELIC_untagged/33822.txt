2 I lived with my parents and my siblings who you've met. 3 I had two sisters who I got along well with and an older brother. 4 My sister and I shared a room where we spent nights talking. 5 My brother who I hardly ever saw slept on the living room couch. 6 It was a large old couch which my father had made himself. 7 My best friend whose family I loved lived across the hall. 8 We went to the same school where we both studied English. 9 Mr. Robinson who everyone was a little afraid of was our English teacher. 10 After school I worked in a bakery which my aunt and uncle owned. 11 They sold delicious bread and cake which people stood in line for hours to buy. 12 My brother and sisters whom I miss live far away now. 13 When we get together we like to talk about the old days when we all lived at home.
