There are still many problems of environmental protection in recent years. One of the most serious problems is the serious pollution of air water and soil. The polluted air does great harm to people's health. The polluted water causes diseases and death. What is more vegetation had been greatly reduced with the rapid growth of modern cities. To protect the environment governments of many countries have done a lot. Legislative steps have been introduced to control air pollution to protect the forest and sea resources and to stop any environmental pollution. Therefore governments are playing the most important role in the environmental protection today. In my opinion to protect environment the government must take even more concrete measures. First it should let people fully realize the importance of environmental protection through education. Second much more efforts should be made to put the population planning policy into practice because more people means more pollution. Finally those who destroy the environment intentionally should be severely punished. We should let them know that destroying environment means destroying mankind themselves.
