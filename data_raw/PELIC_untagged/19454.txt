The most interesting experience I have ever had with money happened four years ago. Normally my parents gave me monthly money and I had to manage it by myself. In March 2005 I would like to buy a new watch as a birthday present for myself so I decided to spend that sum of money that my parents gave me for buying the watch. I bought the watch in the first week of March so the week after first I did not have money left. As a result I borrowed money from my brother and I told him that I would like him to keep this story as a secret. Furthermore I had to be aware when spending money. I preferred to eat at home rather than eating out in order to save money. Moreover I could not go shopping so I had to do other activities such as watching TV reading and gardening instead. Finally I could tackle with this situation and it was one of the best lessons I have ever had in my life.
