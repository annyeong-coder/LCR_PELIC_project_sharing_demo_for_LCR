My best friend's name is Nancy. She is my classmate in the university. Nancy is an optimal people for me whom I never met before. She had been in U. S. Since three years ago. Before I came to Pittsburgh she taught me a lot of things which I might have faced difficultly. She also told me some place where I could buy good Chinese foods. Nancy who has two kids told me how to keep learning Chinese for my children in U. S. We usually communicate by the Skype that is computer telephone system. We talked about many things which we lived in foreign country experiences. She is my best friend.
