I believe that being creative in school is necessary for children to cultivate their potential abilities. If the children can enhance their creativities it is good for them to contribute to society. Because creativity revolves around unique independent and original thinking and those are important for society. Moreover developing human's ability when he is young is much more effective than when he is adult. So that its nice opportunity for the children to have creative classes in school.
