I think that people to home cooked food is important. There are several reasons. First it is more nutrious than eating outside cooked food what is some fast food and junk food. Second outside cooked food is sometimes expensive. So if we eat home cooked food we can help to household economy. Next home cooked food can eat to suit one's taste. The most important thing of these reasons is that we can feel an act motivated by kindness. By these cause I hope what home cooked food is important.
