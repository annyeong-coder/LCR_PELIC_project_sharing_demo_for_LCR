There are both good things and bad things about my apartment. The apartment in which I am living is larger than the one in Japan so I can do exercise like yoga in the living room. Now I am planning to lay it out in order to do more exercise. My most favorite piece of furniture is the deck chair in the living room. It is very comfortable. A lot of times I felt asleep when I lay down. However there are things that I'd dislike about my apartment. Firstly it is too dark. I want more light bulb to light it up. In addition there is no place to hang my clothes up. Furthermore because they live nearby sometimes my roommate's friends drop in my apartment during weekend. I am not able to study. In conclusion my apartment is not good for me to live in.
