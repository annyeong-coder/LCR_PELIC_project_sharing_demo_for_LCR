I have a Kuwaiti friend. His name is ANON_NAME_0. He is my friend since 1985 when I was living in Kuwait. ANON_NAME_0 who is still living in Kuwait always reminds me about a special place in Kuwait. That place where kids usually play soccer called Alhofrah . It was a great time when we were children. I remember many nights when we go to Alhofrah to talk about our school or about our future. Every time I visit Kuwait I go with ANON_NAME_0 to that place where we have great memories.
