My family is a big family. We have 7 people in our family. My father mother 3 older sister and 1 younger brother. My family lives together in my country. I have a wonderful time when we did everything together. My father he is a great leader in our family. My father is an older man now he has white shot hair. He did not tall than me. He has a powerful dark eyes and wrinkled face. He has a brown skin because the sunrise burned his skin. Sometime he look afraid but actually he is a very kind and fun person. My father is a hero for me. When I was young until now he worked hard every day to get money for our family. He never complains of his work and he taught me a lot of thing. He taught me I should work hard and patience for everything. My father never smoke and drink liquor. He is saving money for family. I love my father very much and I want to take care him and everybody in my family. I think my father is a significant person in my life. I will do everything to make him happy.
