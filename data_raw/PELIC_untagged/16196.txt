There are many classes which students can study in ELI. I am going to compare about listening class and speaking class. The three similar things are difficulty duration and importance. First speaking class is as difficult as listening class. Both speaking and listening you have to understand grammar pronunciation and accent. Another similarity between these classes is duration of time. It takes time one hour per day to study. Finally speaking class is as important as listening class. For example if you can understand what were you hear but you can not speak or respond to another it is not useful. These are three similarities of speaking class and listening class. I think it will help you to know more about them.
