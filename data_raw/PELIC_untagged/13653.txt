My husband and I picked out our apartment because it is remodeled and enough for two people. The landowner straightened up the room and tore down the walls and looked nice and new. Now I am really glad we settled on this room. The room cheers me up. I like living in this room. My husband is not good at cleaning. However I like organizing the room putting books back and throwing away old newspapers so I can always clean up the room.
