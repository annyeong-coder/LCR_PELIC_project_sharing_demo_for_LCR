Declining Birth Rate In Japan Declining birth rate is very serious social problem in Japan. There are many causes of this problem. For example expensive child hospital difficulty with work for women and marriage age is becoming later. Because of this problem Japan has many different kind of effects. There are increasing taxes discussion about immigrant and people's population who have a special ability will decrease. If many people think and talk more seriously it will improve this situation. One of the problems is our tax may be increase. We have to pay tax in Japan and that taxes go to old people who can not work. And when we become elder and we also can get back money which I paid for my life. But now children's rate are declining so when I get elder maybe we can't get tax return. Old people's population increase and young people will increase. There is also serious about discussion about accepting immigrants. America or England are very common about immigrant. There are not many immigrants in Japan but recently government have discussion about this. Because if declining birth rate get worse Japan may needs more young people to work from another country. Japanese government can not decide whether this will really fix this problem and worried about racism by accepting immigrant. By getting worse this problem people's population who have a special ability will decrease. Japan has a lot of traditional culture and it is very important to pass down our own culture to new generation. For example there is Sumo. This is very traditional and national sports in Japan. It has a long history but by declining birth rate people who want to do this sports are decreasing. In Japan declining birth rate is big problem and this problem bring down increasing tax discussion about accepting immigrants and decreasing of people's population who have a special ability. It is very important to think and talk to improve this problem.
