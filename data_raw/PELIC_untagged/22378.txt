As a Saudi student who has been living in the U. S. A. For a year I become one of the biggest fan of the American Football. I found the team of the University of Florida is the best team over all the universities in America. Gator has a great player his name is Tim Ti bow. When I saw this player as a first time I though that he is the smartest player in American college football. He has taken the champions once before. But he lost the champion's cup last year. In other hand I'm one of Inter Milan soccer team fans. I used to be a soccer player in my university soccer team and in my high school soccer team. Really I was having a great time with my friends inside the university soccer team. I haven't played soccer for 9 months last time I played soccer was in Gainesville Florida with my Latinos friends.
