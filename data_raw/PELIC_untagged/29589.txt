ANON_NAME_0 The movie Knowing starring Nicholas Cage is a great sci fi movie that contains a mysterious story written by Rayne Pearason. The movie is about numbers written by a young girl from the 50's and was saved until the current time those numbers which has a random sequences written by the girl featured Abby Wayland was found by a professor acted by Nicholas Cage who teach philosophy in MIT. He figured out that those numbers predicts the future and each of those numbers shows a date of an events or disasters and the numbers of the people who died in that event. The professor studied those numbers and that study led him to see a disaster which is a plane crash in front of his eyes. After that he decided to read the numbers that predict the future disasters and try to help prevent the disasters from happening. This movie is a great movie for the people who love the science fictional atmosphere and it also great for the people who are curious about the future and the philosophy that everything happens for a reason and for sequence ways. Nicholas Cage the main actor was perfect for his role in this movie and its added to his great movies. One thing I didn't like about the movie is that some scenes in the movies are hard to believe or unbelievable otherwise everything is perfect. I recommend almost every movie lover to see one of Nicholas Cage's work I attribute the successes of the movie to that great actor. Nicholas Cage my favorite actor made dozens of films and each one of them is remarkable. Not only because his acting which is beautiful but also because he knows how to choose a movie. Knowing the movie is a great example.
