Three years ago my father and I were going to buy some stuff from shopping in Saudi Arabia. It was the middle of the morning and we were so jovial from the morning but some vendors came to my father and some vendors forced my father to buy of them but suddenly my father yelled at them. After that they walked away of him but after while some of them got back to him and then my father fought with vendor until the vendor got injures in his body but my father should not have done that but was embarrassing of all the people who were shopping in there. Also my father should not have gone to that shopping because it is shopping like that vendors come to customer along this shopping street. Five years ago we had match in soccer and my brother was referee in that match but the admass was not satisfied from my brother because they said he was helping the other team. After that the match finished and the coach of the loser team came to my brother to hit him. Then my brother fought him until the admass huddled around to look at the fighting and then the securities came to stop the fighting but my brother was keep fighting but he should not have fought more. Also he should not refereed the match because the match was in the final and all people are biased to their own team.
