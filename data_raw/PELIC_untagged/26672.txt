I have a strong relationship with my friend Marwa we met in the U. S. At a small town we were at the international office for our university. At first when I saw here I thought that she was very old. Then she introduced herself to me and she told me that she was 18 as same as my age. After that day we became so close. We used to hang out a lot and chat about everything. Also we had that strange connection we recognized that we love the same stuff and we have the same opinion.
