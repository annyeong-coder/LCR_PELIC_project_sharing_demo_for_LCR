I strongly believe that sports starts earn too much money because sport has one of the biggest trade field in the world. For this reason they make so much money. In the world there are many kinds of occupations such as doctors teacher engineer but none of these make much money than sports stars. According to me sports stars are the luckiest people in the world because even if they don t play they are paid. I know their job is so stressful because they have to perform in front of thousand of people but it shouldn t be main reason that they make too much money.
