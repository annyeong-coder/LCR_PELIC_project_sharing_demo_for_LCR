My boyfriend always tells me that I should never park in a no parking zone. However sometimes I really have no choices. Last Saturday afternoon we went shopping in South Side. There were a lot of cars parked on the street and we couldn't find a space even after 20 minutes. We didn't really want to park in the parking garages because they were expensive. My boyfriend needed to go to the restroom first therefore he asked me to keep looking for a parking space. At first I still tried to find a space to park but every time the extra space that the car just left was quickly parked by another driver because my driving skill was not so good. I was thirsty and starving so I decided to park in a no parking zone. As a result I got a ticket of 55 fine. I was so regretful that I should have listened to my boyfriend and I ought to have spent more time to wait for the regular parking spaces. Also I could have parked in the parking garages. I also think that if my boyfriend did not leave first he could have been driving and I might not have received the ticket. I learned that I should not have disobeyed the law because at the end it was me that was punished.
