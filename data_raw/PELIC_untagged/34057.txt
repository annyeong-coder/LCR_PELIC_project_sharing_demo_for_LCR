My Life in Last few years I have a lot of things in my life that have changed in recent years. Since I was studying at the university my ambition was to get a job but since I started teaching my ambition has become to complete my education. Last year I thought of traveling abroad. I traveled to Pittsburgh since April. I am now studying at the Institute of English Language. Five years ago I have had a lot of wonderful friends. Since I came to Pittsburgh I have had a good friend. Lately my life has become difficult. I hope to improve for the better as soon as.
