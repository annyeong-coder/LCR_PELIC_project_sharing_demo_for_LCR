This essay made me feel desirous yet nostalgic sad yet very happy. And most of all it made me feel normal. It made me think about the choices we make in our lives. Such choices that seem to be the best thing to do at the time and how time or age change our prospective to life and the way we approach our everyday situations. I imagine my role models in life like my father for instance and how perfect and flawless he is in my eyes and I remember little Jess and her pappy although he had his imperfections while young after he is old enough to think about it differently he looked perfect in little Jess's eyes. Sure this case applies to everyone because all humans make mistakes or wrong choices that they regret on when they are more mature. Have any of us ever wondered what his her life would be 25 years from now Don't we think each and every night before going to sleep what choices have we made today Are we happy with our lives the way it is now Is all of our choices right What will we tell our children or grandchildren about our early life Are we proud of what we are doing and the way we are living our lives I think the whole life is based on the idea of making the right choices on the right time.
