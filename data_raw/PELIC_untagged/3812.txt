I know you are a new ELI student. Will you want to join traditional ELI night at 6. 30Pm on April 15 on the Saturday Usually the ELI night is very exciting and interesting. If you want to go to you should learn more different cultures such as foods and dances. Sometimes it uses Lucy pot to make more variety foods for the night. When you like to cook your culture's foods or your favorite traditional dishes you can make it to share ELI teachers and students. I think they could say that is perfect I need more again! I can not cook if you say. Don't worry. You might ware your beautiful address to dance if you like. Or you are a royal audience if you just show people to perform something things. Anyways you choose. I'll hope you get a special night. See you at ELI night.
