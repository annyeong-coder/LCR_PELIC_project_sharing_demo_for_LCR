When I got home my husband didn't come home yet. I was very hungry so I cooked dinner quickly. I was cooking when he called. He told me he'd be home late and not to wait for him. I was watching TV while I was eating. After dinner I read a book. While I was reading I fell asleep. He came home at 11PM. I prepared dinner for him. We were talking until late last night.
