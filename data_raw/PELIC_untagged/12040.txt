Comparison between Misurata City and Pittsburgh city I was born in Misurata in Libya. And know I am living in Pittsburgh City where I want to complete my graduation study. There are many differences and similarities between both Cities inform of location religion population weather and situation of these cities in the country. The first thing is location. Misurata City located in north of Libya . It is located near the beach which make this city one of the best cities in Libya while Pittsburgh City located in U. S in north of the country but the difference that it is not located on the beach . Second thing is the population. Both of the cities can be considered as not over crowded. But the difference that the population of Misurata city is almost all Libyan and they know each other while population in Pittsburgh are mixed of different nationalities and most of them do not know each other. Third thing both of the cities have three months per year which is nice . But the difference is that in Misurata city that three months are January February and March but in Pittsburgh these months are May June and July. Finally both of the cities are very nice and I love both of them very much
