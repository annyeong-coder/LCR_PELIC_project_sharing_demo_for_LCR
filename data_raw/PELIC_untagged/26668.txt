Me and my friend met at the church 5years ago. Her name is Kyung hee. At the first we met I thought that we might not be friends because she looked totally different type of person to me. But we have been the best friend since 3years ago. The reason was that we shared everything about ourselves. We talked about our family and future. Nowadays we are still best friend. She always advice me about my life. I miss Kyung hee so much.
