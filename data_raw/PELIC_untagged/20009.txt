Nowadays because of high life status more and more couples don't want to have a baby. That is a social problem in my country. There are 3 main effects for fewer children population education and economy. First of all the population of children is very low. For example in my grandparents' generation most families have 5 8 children. In my parents' generation most families have 2 4 children. However lots of people don't want to have any child. They prefer to have a pet rather than a child. Secondly due to fewer children the environment of education has changed. For instance fewer children need fewer teachers. Some teachers may be lay off if they don't have enough students to teach. Moreover part of colleges may close for the same reason. Finally fewer children has affected on economic problem. In conclusion fewer children do affect 3 aspects in Taiwan population education and economy.
