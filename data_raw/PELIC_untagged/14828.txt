In my opinion movies are a good way for people who want to transfer their culture to the other. The movies can help people from other places in the world to have a clear picture about the other culture In addition to narrow the distance between cultures as well. For example some counties don't know my country or at least they do know a little bit about it but when my country posed a film which name is ANON_NAME_0 Al Mokhtar many countries have known my country and our culture. The objective movie is the movie which provide many details and aspects of own culture and to play big role for letting people understand and take into account between cultures. The movies should have special characteristics to attract people and to let them have the desirable to know more and more about the foreign culture. Therefore countries have to share their movies a cross the local and international festivals to apply that. In conclusion movies have provided the easy way to diffusion cultures across all the world.
