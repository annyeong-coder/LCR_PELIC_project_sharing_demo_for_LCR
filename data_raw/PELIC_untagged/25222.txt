How I came to Pittsburgh How wonderful learning English in abroad is! If someone want to study abroad they will make their own plan. And the process which provide study abroad will be very complex process. But in my case this process was totally depended on my husband's process. And that process was take a almost 10 months. My husband's company send their 2 employees to abroad for study every year. In 2008 my husband was selected by his company. We're researched about how we can get admission from University in U. S. And which University can be more appropriate for my husband. After finishing a basic research he took a TOFLE and GRE test. And fortunately he can get good score. And then we can send the application to approximately 10 university. After long waiting he can get admissions from many university. Selecting a university was most difficult process. After long thinking we choose the Carnegie Mellon University. After choosing a university we started to preperation for leaving. Receiving a VISA packing and making a flight reservation was not difficult. But at that time I have to finish my thesis. And I quit the job the day right before leaving. That process was long and hard period for me and my husband too. Even though this process was not easy now I am here. Learning English in U. S. Is a kind of present for me because it's not expected opportunity for me.
