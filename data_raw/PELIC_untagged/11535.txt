In my opinion open adoption is good. I think that open adoption is the least hurting for the children. The ideal is to take care of your children when you give birth. However it is better to let someone else raise him or her if you are not financially able to raise him or her well. By giving the child to someone else the parents are giving him or her a chance to succeed in the future.
