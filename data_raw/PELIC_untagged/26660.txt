Hello . . I see myself as a sociable person. I enjoy meeting new people from my country and from other countries. Also I like being surrounded by my friends and family and that is what I miss here in U. S. So I try my best to make my own people who I can share my daily life with. I am ambitious so I work very hard to reach my goals. My target these days is practising English and use it in my life so I can get to college soon. I am planning to study Health Information Management becase my country really need something like this major and I hope I can success it in.
