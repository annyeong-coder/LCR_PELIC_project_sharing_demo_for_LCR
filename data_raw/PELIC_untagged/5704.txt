Before I came here I had never cooked food by myself. In Thailand I could go out to find food easily and it was very cheap. I could spend 75 cents for a main dish. It was cheaper than cooking it by myself. However I have to spend more than 3 for each meal here. I have been cooking since I came here because when I compared the cost of ingredients with the cost of a dish it was cheaper than buying from the restaurant.
