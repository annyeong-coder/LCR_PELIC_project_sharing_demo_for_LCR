Annie is my best friend who is also my schoolmate in high school. She likes to wear pink clothes which always make her looks cute. She is a really good friend who can give you good suggestions when you need helps. She is good at Maths which always makes me confused a lot. So she became to my private Maths tutor when I have problem on Maths. Now she is studying in Fudan university which is one of the best universities in our city.
