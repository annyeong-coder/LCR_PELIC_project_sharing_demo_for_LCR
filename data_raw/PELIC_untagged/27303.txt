My country Japan is an island nation which lies to the east of China South Korea and some other countries and is located in the Pacific Ocean. In general terms Japan is consisted of four big islands and is mountainous volcanic. The capital city Tokyo is situated in the eastern part of the biggest island. There are a large number of traditional castles temples and shrines all parts of the country and those historical sites attract not only Japanese but also foreign travelers. One of the most popular temples called the Golden Pavilion is in Kyoto and the reason that it is so famous is because its luxuriousness. It is covered with pure gold leaves which was used for showing the power of the then general. Typical Japanese characteristics are often explained as shy polite and also said that they hesitate to say no directly. Japanese cuisine uses rice fishes and a lot of kinds of vegetables for everyday's meals and its taste is mainly based on soy source. An interesting Japanese product which I want to introduce is a electronic toilet seat . In the winter if we turn on that power the seat will be warm and also it has a function to wash buttocks. This may sounds strange but in Japan this is really popular product
