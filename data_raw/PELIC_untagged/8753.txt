My best friend who lives in LA is ANON_NAME_0. Her personality is very independent and sweet. I met her when we studied in senior high school and we began familiar with her at that moment. She is a person who treats friends honestly and sweet thus I learn a lot from her behaviors. Besides she lives her own in LA. So she is so independent. We always have great time and also I am going to visit her in December. Of course I am so excited about this and I will live with her who cleans her apartment lazily. At last I am positive I will visit UCLA with her who she studies in during my trip. I am sure I will have a lot of fun to be with my best friend.
