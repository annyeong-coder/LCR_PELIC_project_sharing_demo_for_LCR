I have been most influenced by my teacher The Head of Saudi Physical Therapy Association Professor ANON_NAME_0 . I am still inspired by hem specially by the way he deals with the student . Once I was trying to discus with him about my semester's research and I was nervous I could not talk very will so he figured I might be nervous so he removed his qutra Arabic Hat and gave me cup of tea and he got some cookies and put them inside his cup then eat it like a child with a lot of jokes and friendly talk all this just to break my weary . Actually his influence can be seen in the development of the physical therapy career in Saudi Arabia . I was taught by him to not underestimate myself or my career. So he will be remembered by me for his dedication to create respectful therapist and respectful career. .
