I feel uncomfortable with the carpet inside the classes I should to speak to ANON_NAME_0 to take it up also I'm gonna tell her to throw away the old projectors. And for the Mac lap I think that there should to be anyone who responsible of turning down or shutting down the computer when the students finish their activities. I think my opinions are not enough and I should ask my classmates to help me out with new planes.
