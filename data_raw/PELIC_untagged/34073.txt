Despite the many time saving devices in our homes people today are working harder and longer. Although some argue that people should work hard to reach their goals that they set for themselves I believe that they also should have more leisure time. It is true that if someone wants to get a promotion one should work hard in order to advance his career but he should also think of himself in terms of his health. Nowadays people are in danger of risking their lives at work if they are thinking a lot and develop stress which can result in either bad habits such as smoking or heart problems. Although one has many responsibilities that he is attending to one's family also has a right to spend time and interact with them. People need to communicate with their families so that they live a healthy life. For example if someone does not show that he cares for his wife or children he might have a bad relationship and results in disrespecting him. Given the fact that having more leisure time can lead to positive results one can be more creative in his work. As a result mental resilience will help him make new ideas and enhance the work outcome such as writers who go to quiet places in order to stay focused and come out with great stories. From my perspective I believe one can have leisure time because it can make a person become more focused once his mind was cleared from all the daily stress that he is facing and he can then resume his life. However it is essential that he also not do it on a daily basis otherwise it is going to affect his attitude and behavior.
