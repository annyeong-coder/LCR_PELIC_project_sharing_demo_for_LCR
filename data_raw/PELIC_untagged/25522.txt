When I was in high school I used to play soccer every week but now I didn't use to play soccer. My friend now he use to play soccer every week. He told me is important in your life play soccer every week. Also I can't play soccer now because I do not have time to play. But now I change my life because when I was in high school I didn't use to practice Running but now I use to practice Running every day .
