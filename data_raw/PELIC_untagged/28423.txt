It is important that you have a neighbor you trust him. Unfortunately I have two messy and dirty neighbors now. One of them always he drink a lot of alcohol then he talks with his mother by noisily high sound. The second is gloomy man. In the past my neighbors were quiet and reliable. They were politely cheerful and helpful. Their clothes were always neat and clean. I can't become familiar wih the new neighbors. So I have been planning to leave to other apartment.
