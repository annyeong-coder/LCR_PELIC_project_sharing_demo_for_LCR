The high cost of gasoline is a problem that has made people annoyed since last year. At first this problem was regarded as a small problem but now people start to realize that this problem can affect other social and economic factors and have potential power to change the lifestyle of people. There are three main effects of the high cost of gasoline. First the transportation system is influenced by the price of gasoline. As we know almost all transportation vehicles rely on gasoline as a fuel. Unless the amount of oil is abundant or we find other alternative natural resources the transportation system must be directly influenced by the price of gasoline. For example the prices of flight tickets are rising because of the high price of gasoline. Moreover people do not want to spend much money for gasoline so they tend to stop buying or driving a car. Second the prices of daily necessities start to rise. One reason for the expensive prices is some items such as plastic are made from oil. In addition the cost of gasoline is relevant for the cost of shipping. Therefore as the cost of gasoline becomes higher the cost of shipping would be more expensive. For example Japan imports much flour from the U. S. Now we have to spend more money for the shipping of flour than before. As a consequence the price of flour in Japan is getting higher than before. Third crimes or panics related with gasoline might occur. The number of theft of gasoline from the vehicles is growing. Actually there were some cases in which gasoline in yachts were stolen in the U. S. This problem also has the possibility to lead the world into an unstable status which has similar impact of the oil crisis in 1973.
