Last night I watched a movie that is Prison Break this is a exciting movie and published in 2006. When I watched it I felt excited because the movie let me felt I have the same experience. The movie talks about a person wants to rescue his brother from jail . When his brother live in jail he feels bored and annoyed . So he decide to rescue his brother. Finally the movie has a disappointing and surprising ending because he and his brother are death.
