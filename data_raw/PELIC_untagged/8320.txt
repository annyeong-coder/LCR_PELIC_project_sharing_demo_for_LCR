Nickell is doubtful and thinks about that Annette Martin's psychic abilities are kind of retro fitting. This means she also had many guesses that were wrong but because she said a few things right people forget the wrong things. In addition she also doesn't believe Annette Martin's abilities because he thinks that her abilities are just the facility of a highly imaginative and emotional person. When she helped police find the missing old man the police already told her a lot of information and it helped her make a good guess. Finally Nickell also said she did studies comparing psychics vs. College students there is not too much difference in the result of guessing.
