In my opinion I think I will accept any person who claims that he or she can help me finding someone or something that I missed. Since my target is getting or finding what I missed or lost it doesn't matter for me if this person can achieve or not. In other words I would rather accept this kind of help with my believing that this help might be success or fail. Joe Nickell is a columnist for the Skeptical Inquirer. When we do actual scientific studies comparing psychics with say college students the difference is the psychics tend to make more guess but they're no more successful . So based on the informations that I mentioned above I will accept the person who claims that he can help me for missing someone or something that I missed.
