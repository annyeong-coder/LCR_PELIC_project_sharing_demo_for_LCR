Although pay attention to the two points of last questions it is possible that we could commit plagiarism by accident. E. G It is difficult for me to differentiate a fact or common knowledge from opinions sometimes. I wrote my thesis a few years ago e. G gastric carcinoma is 5th malignant tumor this is almost a common knowledge so I didn't cite this is plagiarism my supervisor told me to cite although you couldn't find who is the first one to say like this. So what I should do is to cite as early as possible.
