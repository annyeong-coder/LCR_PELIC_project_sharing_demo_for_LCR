In life we experience a lot of things and sometimes some of that is out of our control. I think Good luck is not connected with success. Of course a good situation that you never expected helps you and leads to the success. However it just happened not yours and very temperary happens. If we start to beliving Good luck and expecting more and more we can't improve anything. I know that possitive thinking is good for all of our lives but it's exactly different thing about that. There are lucky situations in my life I'm thinking that 'wow I'm lucky and it's good for me. ' And just blow that facts cause it's not come from my ability or something. Success is based on me my ability how much I worked for something and so on.
