Last Friday I went to Cleveland OH with my friends. One of my friend has a car. We arrived lately at Friday night Fortunately we had a reservation at a hotel. On the next morning we woke up early because we had IELTS exam. After the exam we took tour in the city. It is beautiful city and the weather was so nice. In the second day we moved back to Pittsburgh.
