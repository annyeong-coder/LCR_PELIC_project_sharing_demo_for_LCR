I met my senior Justin when I was working in Korea. He already had studied in Pittsburgh 5years ago. So he helped me while I was studying last semester. One day he was calling me while I was doing homework. He also was asking after my health while I was inquiring after his safety. After that he let me know about information of Pitt transfer requirement and how can I study part time class. He is still helping me that I'm able to living well in Pittsburgh. If I accomplish my object in the U. S. I'm sure that I was effected his assist.
