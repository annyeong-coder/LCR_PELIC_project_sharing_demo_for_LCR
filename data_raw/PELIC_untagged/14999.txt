I like this picture when I saw it at the first time. This picture is a scenery. In front of the picture I saw the river that It make me feel relax. On the left picture. It 's has a buildings. Buildings seem ancient and beautiful. I like it. In the back picture it has a mountains. I think the weather is very good . But I don't know this place located. If I know I'll visit there.
