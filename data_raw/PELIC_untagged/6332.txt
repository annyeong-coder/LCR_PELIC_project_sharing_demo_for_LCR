Described your house When I invite someone who is my friend he she always tells me that my house seems a cottage. I think my house is very comfortable place for me. It makes me happy and I cheer up. When I come back to the home first of all I light lamp up and then I hang up my cloth on a hook. I turn on a computer for check my E mail and I try to make a cook. While I eat the foods I pick out a movie and I watch it I turn up and down the volume but I have to watch out for a microwave. In the morning my room is very disorder because I have to wake up at 7 00AM or less and I go out the home very quickly.
