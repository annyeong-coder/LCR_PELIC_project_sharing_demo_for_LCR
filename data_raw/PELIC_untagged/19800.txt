Android Apocalypse is a movie I don't like which is about humans and robots that looks like humans called android. Jute was a human criminal who were handcuffed together with DEECEE a defective android. They were been attacked by the flying fighter modules while they are on their way from the barren wasteland to a prison. The odds are against them where the entire fate of mankind's existence was depended on their survival.
