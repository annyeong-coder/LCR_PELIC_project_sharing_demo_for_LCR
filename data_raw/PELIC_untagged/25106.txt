I think I should take fishing equipment to find something to eat if the food is gone by fishing . Also I think compass is important and it will help a lot. I will need to use it several time on the island. To know the direction and it will help me a lot if I lost the way back. Fireworks I should take it too because if my boat gone and I am stack on the island I will need fireworks to let others know like an airplane pass or a ship that I am her . Also I should take maps of the area to make sure that I will not going to be lost on the island . A book Tropical Plants You Can Eat is a good book to take it to the island to make sure you will find something to eat if the food is finish .
