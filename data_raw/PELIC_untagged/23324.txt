When I was child I had dreamed about being a driver and one day my big brother asked me if I want to drive his car. In that moment I was really happy and I want to get his car's key before he said no but I had gotten the car's key before he change his mind. Before I started to turned on the car I had cut my hair because really it was a moment I never forget it. On 3 2 2000 at 9 pm my big brother gave me his car's key but before that I had been playing soccer with my friends for 2 hours. So when my big brother saw me with my messy t shirt he had been saying I know that he is playing with the bad people in the street ooh God what should I do with this kid. Finally I had kissed him before he finished what he had said about me as a bad kid.
