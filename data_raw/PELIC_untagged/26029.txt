I came to the US to learn English language and complete the college. That's why I should study hard and focus on my classes. I shouldn't absence and be lazy. Also I ought to do my homework when my teacher tell that. For all students who came to The US You'd better practice your language with a native speaker and read so many books and you'd better not speak in your language especially in your classes.
