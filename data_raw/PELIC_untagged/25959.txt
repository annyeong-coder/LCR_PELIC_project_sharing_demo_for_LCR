My soul mate is my husband who married me five years ago. When I was young I tried to find someone whose personality is perpect. With ages I realized the fact that none of us is perfect. My husband told me he had liked me from the moment when he had met me at first time. My husband is not a person who is perfect but he is someone whom I can trust. From my perspective soul mate is a person with whom I can share my feeling.
