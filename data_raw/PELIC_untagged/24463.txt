My husband took emergency operation on appendicitis in February and he was feeling better. After two weeks I wondered whether he was all right to go shopping but he was bored and wanted to go to the near store with me. What shocked me was that my husband suddenly fell down on his back wobbling on the floor at the store. I thought that he hit the back of his head and fainted. I hold up his head immediately and he could stand up by himself soon but he was uncertain what was happen and how he fell down. It was clear that he was tired and felt dizzy. I was surprised by the fact that he walked on the icy slope of our apartment two times for exercise before going out. I couldn't understand why he needed to rush doing exercise so hardly. Then the fact that he had no problems after taking the examination of artery and carotid reassured me. That his doctor told him was that he needed six weeks until his perfect heeling after the operation.
