Everything was fresh and different than my country after I arrived to Pittsburgh International Airport. It was so suprised because there were so many bridges. When I arrived to CMU it was a huge area of grass and a famous art wrok Working to the sky . After two days luckly I found a convenient and nice apartment at Shadyside. There was suuny everyday even though the weather was hot but it didn't make me feel humid at all. The first week living in Pittsurgh was impressed.
