Hi! My name is ANON_NAME_0 Borquez. I have this name because the name of my father is ANON_NAME_0 too. I'm from Mexico but now I'm living in the U. S because I'm studying English. I live in Pittsburgh and I think that it's a nice city for living although I miss to my parents and the mexican food. In adition I'm planning a trip to Florida this week because my cousins and I want to go to the NASA and maybe we will visit Miami too. It will be a great experience!!
