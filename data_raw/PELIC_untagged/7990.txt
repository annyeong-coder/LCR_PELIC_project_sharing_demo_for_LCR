Now there are no valuable things as important as houses for me. When I was in my country Korea I had never been worried about housing because I lived with my parents. After I came to the U. S I had to manage to find a house by myself. Fortunately as soon as I arrived at the U. S I was able to live with American family. However I felt very scary whenever I came back home from the school because the neighborhood was dangerous. Eventually I decided to move out and had to find my house. At that time I thought that it was easy for me to find a place to stay. However I could not find my apartment and house easily unlike my expectation. When I realized that I had no house to stay my eyes were getting darker. While I was finding my place to stay I had to go through my suffering.
