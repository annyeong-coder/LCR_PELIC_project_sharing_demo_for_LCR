The first week in Pittsburgh was very cruel. First of all when I arrived here I did not speak English that was a big problem because I was not able to talk with people in the hotel the stores and school. Also I lived this week in a hotel and spent a lot of money there. In addition I was looking for an apartment and I did not find it in this week. In conclusion my family and I were very tired in the first week in Pittsburgh.
