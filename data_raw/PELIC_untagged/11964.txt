Hello I am writing this paragraph to introduce myself. My name is Yi ANON_NAME_0 Last Name . You can just call me Sophia. I come from Taiwan. Let me talk about my hobbies. I like playing basketball and jogging. I go jogging at least twice a week. That is why I am healthy. I am studying English here in the ELI because I want to attend graduate school at Pitt. My major is Business Administration Management. I want to study MBA here. If you ask me why I chose here to study for MBA I can tell you that I am interested in business and the U. S. A. Is a big country where I can learn the newest things . I want to explore the world instead of studying in my country . By the way I love traveling I can travel and learn about different cultures here. That s why I am here and studying in the ELI. Nice to meet you.
