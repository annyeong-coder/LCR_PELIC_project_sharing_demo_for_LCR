I see great importance to the group as PETA. It's very important group emphasize that testing on animals not necessary. We need more groups like PETA because people company believes that the benefits of animal research outweigh the cost. How they can sell life by money It's cruel dispite the advances of research. Modern technology involves a wide range of methods to promote medical progress. Countries like Israel does not perform animal studies on religious grounds but their research continue. Today there are many products with the tag not tested on animals . This proves that people understand you can do without abuse. Companies opposing the constitution protecting life show as criminals. We need more groups like PETA
