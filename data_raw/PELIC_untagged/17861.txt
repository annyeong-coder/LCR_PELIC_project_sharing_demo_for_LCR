Dear Miss In my opinion I will give some advices such as focus on your study step by step let your parents know Jim and make other new friends in America. First of all like you said you had planned to spend two years getting your master's degree therefore you should try your best to get good grades and get your degree. Because I think that your parents also hope they don't want you to delay your study. Moreover it goes without saying that be a study has to do your best to study. In addition I believe that one of reasons your parents rejects is you just know each other nine months . Dot't you think it quickly happened to talk about weeding Even though it will happen in the future I also think you quickly decide to marry Jim. Moreover are you sure you konw Jim very much I think that you should let your partents know Jim first and in holidays Jim and you can return to Japan together. You can formally introduce Jim to your parents and let them know Jim and realize him step by step. Finally don't decide to marry Jim quickly. It is very important for you. Because you just start your master career you have many chances to make other friends such as in the school's clubs in other classes . . . . And so on. I know that it is very sweety with Jim but don't forget you just to know each other 9 months. You can have better opportunities to know other friends in other word you should enjoy your master career first because it is very colorful. Therefore I hope that my ideals will give you help and you can not only get master degree but also balance your parents ideas with you. If you also have any problems you also can let me know. I hope you can enjoy your master career .
