How you can be happy If you want to live a happy life you can enjoy your life but with three important things. Some people think that if you want to be happy you should be famous and that's not true because they think if you are famous you will have a lot of money and that is not always happen. In my perspective these three important things are you should be healthy educated and wealthy. The first thing which I talked about it health in my opinion if you have a good health you will be able to live a normal life. For example if you have a problem in your chest that problem will affect all your body so you will not be able to run for a long time also if you have a small problem in any part your body this problem will effect all your body so we can say the health is important for the person . You won't feel this health until you miss something in your body then you will feel that thing was so important for you. The second thing is about education. In my opinion if you are education you will work in a good place and you will have enough money also in the future you will be able to teach your children if they don't understand something. The third effect for happiness is to be wealthy it's not important to be wealthy but if you are you being wealthy the life will change with you and you will live a beautiful life like you will be able to buy a luxury car and join your child in a good school. At the end I want to say all that about happy and enjoying the life is just my opinion so maybe you will deal with me maybe no. My advice If you want to live a happy life you will live you are who decide.
