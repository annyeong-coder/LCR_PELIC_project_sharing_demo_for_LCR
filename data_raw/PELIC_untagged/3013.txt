Identation My apartment is a cold haunted house. I live in a first floor of a somewhat rundown house. A quiet Chinese family lives above me they are calm but they sometimes make a sudden scary noise that sounds like rocks falling from the sky on the roof. My bedroom window faces the north which makes the room an icy igloo. Therefore I spend most of my time in my living room. Occasionally in the middle of the night the heater turns on making an earthquake every night. It makes a loud frightening sound that vibrates the floor and wakes me up. However the kitchen is the coldest place in my apartment. When I wake up in the morning I blanket myself to go to the icy kitchen as if I were going outside. At 8 20 a herd of elephants cross by as I am ready to leave home. The train is not really close to my apartment but it feels like it crosses in front of my apartment. Overall the place where I live is bitter and nerve racking hut.
