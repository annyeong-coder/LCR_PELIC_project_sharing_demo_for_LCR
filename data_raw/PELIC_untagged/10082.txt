The most interesting experience I've ever had with money was about one moth ago. In the first week of my course at the ELI I went to buy my books. As soon as I saw how many books I should carry with me every day I decided to buy a new backpack. When I was at the book store I couldn't find the backpack that I wanted and so I decided to pay for the books and try to go in another shop to find the backpack. So I paid with my italian credit card and I went out from the book store. After a couple of hours I was going backward and forward in a very huge shop full of any kind of bags. Chosen the bag that I liked I went to the counter desk in order to pay. I took my credit card again and I gave it to the woman at the desk. After a couple of attempts the woman told me that my card was blocked. I was scared. The first thing that I thought was How can I survive in the United States with no money . Fortunately that night I had enough cash to pay the bag and to avoid any embarrassing situation. The day after talking with a friend of mine I discovered what had happened at the shop. After the first payment at the book store the italian bank system recognized an operation in the United States on an italian account without knowing that the operation was authorized by the account's owner. So in order to avoid illegal operations on my account they had blocked the card thinking that it may have been stolen. Now my bank knows that I'm in the United States and so I can access my account as I did in Italy.
