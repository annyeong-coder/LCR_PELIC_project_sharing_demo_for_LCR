I met my best friend when we were in secondary school. It was the first day we went to school. I was sitting in the classroom and waiting for my school uniforms when she came in and sat beside me. Then we talked a lot and became friends. In the following school life we went through many difficulties and challenges on study together and we always encouraged each other when we were upset. Finally we reached our goals and went to different high school. Now she is in Australia and I'm studying in the U. S. Sometimes we use facetime to chat and I think the friendship between us is always here.
