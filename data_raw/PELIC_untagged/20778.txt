A man who was dead went to the heaven. The god asked him how many times he had met other women as cheating his wife. God already knew how many times he had lied to her so asked him to be honest. He said that he had never met the other women when he was alive. So god gave him a Lexus. The other man who was also dead went to the heaven. God asked him the same questions whether he had cheated his wife or not. He answered that he had met two women to the god. Then god gave him a second hand car. A few months later he who got a second hand car went to the downtown and he saw his wife who rid a bicycle.
