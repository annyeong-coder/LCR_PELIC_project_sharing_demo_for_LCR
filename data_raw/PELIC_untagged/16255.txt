I dream of having a job that require a lot of travel. First of all I do not like staying behind a disk and working on a computer all day long. Beside I really love traveling so I am not going to get bored in work. This kind of jobs will help me to discover new country and cultures. Also it is nice to meet new people every couple of days. If I find a job like that I will have fun and work in the same time.
