Dear Mom I need a new computer my computer is too old to use it . You know my computer I use for five years . When I use it to work it always makes me upset . Can you buy a new computer for me I think I want to own an apple computer . Many students use it in American . It easy and good for students . It pricce is a little higher than other computers but it's good for me . When I use it I feel comfortable and relaxed . You know that HP and SONY are a little different from apple . HP is the biggest computer company in America and many people use it in America but if a student to use it apple is better than HP. Apple is more easier than HP . Sony is good too but if you compair Apple and Sony . Apple is cheaper than sony at the some used . I like apple they have black and white colors for choices . I prefer a white apple more than blake apple . If you have time please order a computer on the internet for me thank you !
