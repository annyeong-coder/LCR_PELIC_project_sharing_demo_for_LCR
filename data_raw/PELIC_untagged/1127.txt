My friend Joe has been lived Pittsburgh for 12 years and has been lived in America since he was six years old. But he told me he's never worn blue jeans since he came to the U. S. And he's never liked them. I was surprised for the case because blue jeans have been popular since the early 1960s. He told me he has studied Spanish since he was in high school Spanish is him third Language.
