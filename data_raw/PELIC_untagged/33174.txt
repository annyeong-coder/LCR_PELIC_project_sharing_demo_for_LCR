My unsolved mystery happened when I was in the 4 grade. My family had chickens as pets and I loved them! They were petted for many generations when I was growing up. My chickens had been being eaten by cats as a result the coop was built. Together with my brothers our hobby was shooting cats by the airsoft gun a kid toy. The shot cats just ran away and were unable injured. However we cannot watch out all the time and some of my chickens were killed especially the chicks. They were being kept in the coop at the back yard during the night for protection against cats. After they had had my lead to the coop for several times they got there by themselves without my order when the sun set. Thus I just went there to count and to lock them out every day. However there was a strange situation. One day I found out that the coop door was locked by no one! I already asked everyone but nobody locked the door. Should the coop door have been locked by the chicken! That was my believed when I was a child. It was impossible wasn't it I haven't found the answer until now. Several months later I learned that a coop was double edged sword it gave protection but also prohibited escape. All of the chickens disappeared in one night. The coop grill was deformed wide enough for something that was a strong man's arm size entered inside the coop. I got shocked by that so my next target was a snake. However I have never made revenge.
