I decided to go to the United States of America in order to achieve two goals which are to improve my English and to find an internship in this country. On the one hand in France I didn't study English for my fifth year in law. Obviously I don't have a good level with this language. I chose to go to the ELI for help me to acquire more vocabulary to increase my level in listening and to write beautiful essay. At the end of my term I would like to pass the TOEFL test and I would like to have a target score of 90 points. That's explains by the fact that I want to have a certificat in order to do my first job's experience in USA. On the other hand I am specializing in Financial Sector and my initial purpose is to find an internship in USA. Indeed I think that to do my first experience in a foreign country is really interesting. I am enthusiastic about the idea to cooperate with american people and to learn the differences between the french laws and the american laws. That is relevant to my curious spirit.
