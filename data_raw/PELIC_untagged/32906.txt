I want to improve my writing skills so that I can continue my post graduate studies in the university and have a wonderful life. Having a chance to be admitted to a post graduate study program in a university is a great chance. Therefore I must pass the TOEFL test with a result of 80 marks or more. After I become admitted to the university I can use my writing skills to write essays different topics in my major researches. For that I will be able to continue until I graduate with a PhD. Having a high degree in my profession means skills and smartness in that profession. So I will be able to use this profession in a great way. Using my profession in a great way after graduating can help in developing the society and countries. I will have a wonderful life when I get back to my country with my PhD degree to join my university over there as an assistant professor. Therefore I can use my profession in helping the society to develop and then my city. My job in the university will help me getting more money to have a better life. Writing is important for me so that I can achieve my goals in life and to be an active person in my society and country.
