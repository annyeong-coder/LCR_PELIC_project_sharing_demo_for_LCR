As a immigrant family I didn't teach my son any English because I knew I have my native accent. Now my son is speaking like a native speaker and sometimes he can correct my pronunciation. Among my reading speaking listening and writing English skills I used to think that speaking is my strong suit. While talking to native speakers I am confident and I don't think my pronunciation will negate people's understanding. Not until I attended the ELI classes did I realize that my broken English is poor and that I speak very carefully only when it counts. I should persist to hone my English while retaining my Chinese tongue.
