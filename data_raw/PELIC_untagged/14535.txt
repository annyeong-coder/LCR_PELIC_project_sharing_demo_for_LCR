Hello my friend I would like to give you some advices while you are coming to study in USA. First of all you'd better choose the appropriate time for traveling otherwise you may stay one night transit in the airport. Then you should bring some money with you to be used in the first few weeks until the Embassy will start giving you the scholarship. But you should not bring more than 10 000 because if you bring more than that you will pay a tax. Also you should bring international driving licence if you plan to buy a car in the US. Also you'd better post your papers to the Embassy as you arrive and you ought to meet the student advisor in the institute who will help you too much as all American people they are very helpful kind and sympathetic. When you arrive you should open an account in the bank and you'd better start looking for an apartment and you should keep in mind that the apartment rent is to some extent expensive and you may take long time to get a suitable apartment near the university.
