And fall down the steps. I hurted my knees which were going to bleed. I had to stop my blood but couldn't find any plaster. I used my favorite hand kerchiefs to stop the blood. After I realized that I had no time for breakfast. I was really in a hurry. So I decided to go without breakfast. I rushed into my car and drove to work. On my way to work I decided to take a shortcut through an old part of town. I never used that way before but my friends told me that this way is pretty fast to get to my work. The town was looking very old. I realized that many poor people were living there. It seemed that no modern technologie existed here. It looked death. Nothing was in good condition. I tried to leave this place as fast as I can. However after a few seconds my car was going to stop slowly. I checked my gas which was ok. I found out that I had a puncture that took my time over 40 minutes. I wa late at work but I not to be later than I was. She reminded me that I had an interview with an important client and that we had a big lost in our company. She was very angry. She expected me not to see anymore at work. At this moment I thought about my chain letter. All of this might not happend if I never had put it away. I tried to persuade her to give me one more chance. I told her about the chain letter and all the events that happened today before I came late at work. It was really difficult to persuade her but after a long time she understood me.
