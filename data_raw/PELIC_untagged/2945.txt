My Old Green Car indent My old green car is my heart. I love it as much as any old friend. When I see its green color I felt comfortable like when I sit in a wonderful dark green garden. It had seats soft as water. I was never tired when I sat in it as long as I could. Also I always remember that when I drove my old car it felt me smooth as cold cream. It has been driving very quiet like an ant. You couldn't hear any sound from it. When I think about passing gas in my car I find it very economical. It was a wellspring that I have gone every where by it and it didn't ask me any gas unless after really long time. It really had good characteristics that few cars have. Its headlight was the full moon that clarifying every thing was front of me wherever I was. It was like gunshot in its speed. When I had to go anywhere quickly it has been helping me to arrive on time. I have been listening to plenty of tapes and CDs by my car's clear stereo system which was like a bird's warble among trees forest in the morning. I will never forget my old green car in a whole my life.
