Elephant Rock Beach is an extraordinarily beautiful place the clean and blue water that make you feel like you are floating on air and colorful sandy is fantastic. The beach has a long sandy stretch beside and the great Ocean provides plenty of opportunities for surfing walks swimming fishing and just relaxing and depending of the day the waves are heavy and powerful breaking on rocks and sand. Also the beach is a very beautiful location with gorgeous vegetation and modern restaurant where you can eat different dish. It is the best beach that I have been it place is spectacular.
