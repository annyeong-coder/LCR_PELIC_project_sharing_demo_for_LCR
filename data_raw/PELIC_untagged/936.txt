It was a thing at funeral. My uncle who made much of me died in March in 1999. I was so sad he is te one of the person who I can unbosom myself to. The funeral was performed in a Buddhist's temple where he often used to go during his life time. Very many people are gathered in the temple even a relation who lives in USA. But most interesting people was another person who was surprising me. My Ex ! My ex girlfriend who broke up with me 2years ago was in there and I saw that she was wearing earnings which I bought for her. When we saw each other we looked up in surprise. And then she started walking to my way.
