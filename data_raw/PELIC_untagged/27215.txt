Living on a deserted island will be very hard . I will need a lot of things to survive . I think that I should take some fresh water . I might not find any fresh water to drink . I think I will need several books about navigation by the stars and tropical plants I can eat. I think I have few fireworks I should bring more. I think I will need some fishing equipment . Maybe I don't find any thing to eat so I go fishing. I think that I have enough cooking pots so that I can cook . I think I will need telescope and radio so that I can try to find any help .
