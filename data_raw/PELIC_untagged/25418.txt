Dred years the weather has become more extremely in temperature. That's mean the summer get hotter and the winter get colder. As the global warming become more serious the summer and winter may be more unbearable. For example India has twenty three people died last summer because of the heat is too high almost 112 in Fahrenheit this number is the largest ever. Secondly the increase heat of atmosphere will also melt the ice in the two poles area. This phenomenon will make the sea level rise and country that is at low sea level may cover by water and disappear. Holland and Bengal are two countries that are facing this serious problem recently. Thirdly the temperature's change will also affect the growing of crops. Lot of countries may be force to face the food shortage because they can no longer plant anything such as Africa and South Asia. Moreover changes of atmosphere have influence people's health in some biological and chemical reasons. For example the number of people that have skin cancer increase every year. The reason is because without the protection of some elements in the atmosphere such as Ozone O3 the skins will exposure directly under the sunshine and makes the gene of skin mutate. This is one of the likely reasons that cause skin cancer we know today. Nists we can also help improve the environment in several ways. One way is to save electric. Turning off water and light when we don't use are basic things that we should have done to save our energy. Besides we should walk by stairs if the storey is not so much instead of taking the elevators. The other way is to avoid making too much carbon dioxide. Taking bus or other public transits instead of driving is an easy thing to do and it really helps a lot.
