In my opinion to throw away usable items is very strange behavior. Therefore people don't throw usable items away. There are many reasons to agree with this statement three of which I will explain below. In the first place we probably fell to need for using these items after throw away. For that reason we should keep to these items in the storage for a short period. Another reason is that if we don't need usable items we should donate these items to a charity. In the text thirteenth and fourteenth paragraphs one person donate household items which are found on the curb to a charity. So the text support the donation. In my opinion if we put these items on the curb these items could be soaked under the rain or these items could be damaged. For this reason we should donate usable items to a charity directly. Last but not least wastefulness is very bad habit about all society and this habit can damage the sources of country. When we product items we use some kind of sources which are very important about all the country. If we throw away usable items our sources would be decreased or would be finished. In the text eighteenth paragraph one person support this idea. He fixed the television which was found on the curb and used them in his house. Besides he criticized throwaway society. In conclusion all the reasons I have mentioned above clearly supports the idea that we shouldn't throw away usable items.
