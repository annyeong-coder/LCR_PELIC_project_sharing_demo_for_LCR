List 1. Similar bats 2. Similar gloves 3. Similar rule of bases 4. Similar defended position 5. Similar shoes 6. Similar field Baseball and softball are very similar sports. First of all they have much equipment in common. For instance both baseball and softball can be hit by the same bat. Second you can use the same glove to catch baseball and softball. In addition you can wear the same shoes to play baseball and softball. In my country we usually use the same field to play both. However if you play a game both baseball and softball have similar rules of bases. And also both of them have very similar defended positions. For example both baseball and softball have a pitcher a catcher a first base a second base a third base and a short stop in the infield. They also have a left field a center field and a right field in the outfield. But the softball has one more defended position. . The position is between with infield and outfield. We wouldn't fix the position. It is changeable according the condition of the game. Finally both of them are my favorite sports.
