Last weekend my friends and I went to a national park. It was sunny on morning I should have had my sun glasses with me but I forgot it. When we arrived the park and begin to hike it was a little cloudy. I thought it could be rainy after a couple of hours we could have return to parking lot at that time. But I was wrong it was rainy just in half hours. We didn't have umbrella with us but a friend said It's not a big rain we don't have to go back it's just shower. We enjoied the rain until it turned bigger. A girl said I can't take shower more I must go back. We wanted to buy some dry cloth in gift shop but it was almost 7pm at that time the gift shop must have closed. Fortunetly no one cold after this trip.
