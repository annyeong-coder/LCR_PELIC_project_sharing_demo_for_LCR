Larry's Flying Lawn Chair Larry loves flying but he hates airports so he decided to fly from his house by inventing a flying lawn chair. He tied 45 weather balloons to the tied chair and filled with helium. Larry's friends were skeptics about his ability to fly but he was confident although he doesn't have any training. He packed up his lunch and some stuffs that help him land such as a refile Parachute and a CB radio to alert aircraft. His friends surprised he could fly when they cut the rope. Larry ascended above California coast. Traffic control was reported that there is a flying chair the guy is currying a gun. He enjoyed his time but it was very cold there so he decided to land by shooting the balloons but he couldn't control the descent. The chair touched power cables causing a power cut in Los Angeles. Police asked him why did you do that . A man can't just set around Said Larry.
