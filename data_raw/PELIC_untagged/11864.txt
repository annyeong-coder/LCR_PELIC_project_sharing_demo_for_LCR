A nice place to eat lunch in Oakland is saleam halal restaurant in Bought Street. Here behind Pittsburgh University front the post office just five minutes from the cathedral you can eat delicious Arabic food. For me I like to eat there because there are many things especially relevant to my religion and my country. I like to rice with lamb chicken and salad. Also I enjoy by eating some sweet or drink soft drink. Often I choose to sit outside in the park and enjoy eating and watching a beautiful landscape. My favorite restaurant great place to eat your lunch.
