When I was eighteen years old I usually spent all of my fee time with my friend who left in the next door. My house was located in Lopburi where has a lot of monkeys in Thailand. We really loved to hang out with Bob whose big red bicycle. There of us rode our bicycles to a temple that close to our house. There were many people every Sunday because some part in the temple where was closed to the main entrance lined up against the temple wall. Some of them sold Thai desserts which I could not find in Pittsburgh. Importantly handmade toy which made from wood or unused cans or bottles. There are my good time when I was a child.
