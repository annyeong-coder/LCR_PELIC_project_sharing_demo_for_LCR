My life will be completely deferent from now if I had been born the opposite gender. If I'm a female I wouldn't have such a great friend like those who I have now and I wouldn't be able to drive a car on this early age. Also if I had been born the opposite age I could have started collage in my country. I wish I could try this experience for one day and go back to my real gender after that.
