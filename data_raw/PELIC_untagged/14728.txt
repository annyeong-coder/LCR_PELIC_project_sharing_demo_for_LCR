My teacher in chemistry was pattern of the perfect tutor for me. First of all she made me do a lot of homework and made me study very hard. But also she had me make connections the cause to the result. My teacher got me to try to understand how does a chemistry work. In addition she helped me learn how can I use the information that I know to be effective although I didn't memorize all chemical formulas. Finally she let me debate and critical think about the issue nevertheless she was the authority in chemistry and my knowledge was not at the same level like her's. My schoolteacher was important not only in my school day but also outside the school because I could use her advices in my private life or at the work.
