Gloval warming has a significant problem of environmental issue. I think one of the largest factors to global warming is the general problem of overpopulation. Many numbers of people consume stuff that take more energy to make stuff. A large amounts of people drive cars and make a lot of garbage. These factors increase the global warming problem. Many kinds of gases can increase the planets temperature. If temperatures indeed rise most important result is some portion of the polar icecaps will be melt. And raise global sea levels. The rise in sea levels will destroy some lands. As a results of facts flooding will be occur all over the world.
