In my country most high schools usually teach Korean English math science history and other academic subjects. However my school was different from common high schools. I took academic classes but they taught me specific skills for getting a job after graduating high school. When I was a student in a high school I did not like to do things like studying exercising and attending classes. However I liked to attend only one class in my whole school life. The class was about electronic circuits. In the class the teacher distributed circuit diagrams to us and we had to make a circuit. At that time I used to concentrate extremely hard in the class. Hence sometimes I made a circuit and tested the circuit when the sun went down. I did not recognize that my friends already left when I looked around the classroom. I think this is because I was in 'flow'. However in my opinion 'flow' is not related to creativity. Maybe it depends. In my case I just concentrated on the class more than on other things and I think that had nothing to do with creativity. In 'flow' I did something more efficiently independent of time but it did not influence creativity.
