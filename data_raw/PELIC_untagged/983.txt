I remember that I played with my neighbors when we were children and the ground which was next my home was our Neverland. We played baseball on the ground after school everyday. One of my neighbors whose family was rich had a lot of toys and comic books therefore we had many resources which we could play with. Usually we unfolded paper box which was thrown on the ground and we laid on planar box and read comic books all afternoon. There was a truck which was always parking on the ground. We saw the trunk as our castle where we stayed to rest after rushing on the ground. When we grew up however we all were busy on studying and hadn't seen each other for a long time. I miss the happy past time and that ground where I got a lot of fun in my childhood.
