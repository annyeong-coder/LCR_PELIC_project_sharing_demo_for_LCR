In the summer 2008 I went with my friends to the mountain to camp there. We were thirteen person . We arrived to the mountain in the evening at 5 pm. The weather was nice . We were had a dramb . Someone was played by it and other guys were singing. We sat there one day and came to our home . When we were coming to our city in the car all the guys were tired form this trip. The person who was driving the car was tired also but the music was so high . We stopped on the market on the road to buy coffee for all the guys . We were not want any one sleep in the car . We arrived to our city in the morning . We were happy for this trip but we were so tired
