My favorite kind of Music. Mi favorite kinds of music are Latin Rock Pop Romantics and Instrumental. For me the best solo singers are Ricky Martin and Thalia both are Pop singers. In Romantic music I like Celin Dion Luis ANON_NAME_0 and ANON_NAME_1 ANON_NAME_1. I think that ANON_NAME_1 ANON_NAME_1 is a good composer. In Latin Rock I like Mana and Enanitos Verdes. Another kind of music that I like is instrumental. I like instrumental music because is calming and delighted for me. When I listen to this kind of music I feel inspirational. I don't like listen annoying music but when I am a party I like listen lively music.
