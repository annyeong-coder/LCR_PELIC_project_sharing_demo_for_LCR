The most important thing is finding her out I don't mind which methods to search her. When traditional methods failed you don't know what else you can do for your daughter. Some people seek for help from psychic even the police ask for help from psychic. In fact one survey shows that thirty five percent of police departments have used psychics to end cases. There are different psychics in different customs. If psychics never working and never helping people. Why there are some people come from ever backgrounds believe it try to solve problems out by psychics. Even if science can't prove the paranormal but there are still some meanings of it. You don't need to believe it but you can't reject it. It is a way an opportunity and a help. Psychics are the people to help people resolve problems. But it just a method of many methods don't depend on it too much.
