Advice for my friend I can understand why you are angry and depressed. You MIGHT think that you don't have anything. It MAY seem that your circumstance never becomes better than before but you SHOULDN'T give up yourself. As long as you continually keep living like this you WON'T be happy and satisfied. To live the best life for you you HAVE TO stop smoking which causes for diseases such as cancer or respiratory ailments and do exercise regularly. Once you start doing exercise you MUST be got back your health and your anger also will be softened. I think if your circumstance gets better you WILL be able to find a job the best matched with you. Cheer up friend!
