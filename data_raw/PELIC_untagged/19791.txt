My hometown is Nakhon Ratchasima which is one of provinces of Thailand. Most people prefer to call city's nickname which is Korat. Korat are well known by one of the U. S. Air force base during Vietnam War. That means Korat is one of Thailand's provinces that has good infrastructure. It also has many things that related to aviation until today. I grew up with my cousins who went to school with me. We have often seen a lot of aircraft which is pass over our house every day. Although we love an airplane but most people in my hometown live their live with agriculture. Neither I nor he prefers to be a farmer that is the most occupation in Thailand. We both ask each parent to go to Bangkok which is Thailand's capital in order to study instead of living there.
