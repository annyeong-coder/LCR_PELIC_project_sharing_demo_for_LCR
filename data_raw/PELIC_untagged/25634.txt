2. Creativity can't be learned or organized. It doesn't have any structures rules or time limits. Individual creativity is usually unorganized. I think that schools should encourage creativity in children because sometimes children don't even know what potential and skills they have. Schools can indicate their skills and creativity and help with improving them. There are some society rules that should be followed but there are also some that are set by overwhelming majority even if they don't make any sense. And who decides if these rules should be followed or not For ex education system in my country Why can't I be a translator or an English teacher without knowing math So everyone who wants to be a translator or an English must learn math but what if I don't agree with this. Why do I have to follow this rule if I it doesn't make any sense to me. So I think that children don't have to learn to follow the rules of society at school.
