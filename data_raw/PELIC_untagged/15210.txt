Introduce my room. There is two windows when I go and pass the living room and open the door of my room. These have a view of the basketball court and high school. Sometimes I look at them and think that I used to play basketball with friends. I am using the room alone and My bed is next to the windows. There are pictures and a calender on the right wall. On the left wall is a dresser and there is a clock over the dresser. The table is between the bed and dresser. On the table is a bookcase and a laptop. There are also several pens books and notebooks in the bookcase. I usually use laptop and study after school.
