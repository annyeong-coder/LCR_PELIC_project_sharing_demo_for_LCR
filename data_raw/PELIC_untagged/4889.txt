After we graduate Univ. Or high school we have to get a job. Nowadays there are so many jobs in the world so we have a lot of chances to get a job. Some people who are looking for job want to enter a huge company. On the other hand others want to go into business for themselves. Both have good points and bad points. To take a position in a company is more safe than work by oneself. However It can be more difficult such as overwork and stress from boss. Although to go into business for themselves is dangerous that people feel free to do something. I'd like to choose the latter because I want to find what I really want to do and try to do what I purpose to be happy.
