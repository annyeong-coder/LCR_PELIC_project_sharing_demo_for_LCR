Prison break is the best TV show that I have ever watched. The main actor wanted to save his brother who is innocent and in the jail. In order to accomplish the mission he had the tattoo which is the structure of the prison and some special symbols for escaping. He sent himself to the jail where nobody has escaped successfully before. The main actor is a genius calculating everything accurately. Although they had troubles when they planed to escape they still got away successfully with 5 prisoners. This TV show has been continuing with season two and season three I have not seen. If I have free time I will watch the whole show catching my eye a lot.
