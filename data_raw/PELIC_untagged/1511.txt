It's an excellent movie I think it was a good job to make aware people in all the world who consume Mc Donald's food regularly. It' s a bad diet of sugar high fat calories and carbs. I think that the best message that the film had for us was that Mc Donald's Company doesn't care about our health the only think that they want is to sell their products and win more and more money.
