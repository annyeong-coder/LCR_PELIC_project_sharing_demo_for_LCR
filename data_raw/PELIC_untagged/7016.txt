In december I'm going to Italy for two weeks I'm excited!There are a lot of places I may visit I could visit Roma Florencia Venecia and Milan but I might not have time for these reason I'm going to call my friend Angelo who live in Rome maybe he could help me to decide what places to visit. If Angelo thinks two weeks aren't enough I may change my ticket however I already bougth my ticket and migth not be able to change it.
