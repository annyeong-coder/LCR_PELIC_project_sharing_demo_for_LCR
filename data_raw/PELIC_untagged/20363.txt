When I were going to be shipwrecked near a deserted tropical island I would take the most important five items. First I would take an ax because I need it to cut trees move the earth etc. Second I would take a lot of matches to make fire. Third I would take some of fireworks to make some signals to anybody for help. Forth I would take much water to drink. Finally I would take enough fishing equipment to catch some fishes for eating.
