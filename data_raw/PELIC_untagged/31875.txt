Hi Peacock How have you been I have to tell you that. I'm interested on a new stuff that is a stunning activity skydiving. Tell you that I wish one day I could fly in the sky and I could observe the earth from the sky. Since I took this program They have trained me a lot. The skydiving class was finished since one week ago. Two days ago I really jumped out from an airplane. I was so anxious due to first time. Then I closed my eyes and hopped out. This has been my priced experience so far. I would have been keeping doing this. Also I have been looking for next time to do that again. So would you be with me Have been waiting your feedback since now. . . . Best Jay.
