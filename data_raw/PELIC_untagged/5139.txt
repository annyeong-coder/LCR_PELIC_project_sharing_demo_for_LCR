Studying in USA is something interesting here is some of my advises that may help you in your studying life in USA. First you need to make a schedule for your day because the schedule is going to help you to choose the good time for studying. Second you should always do your homework then try to practice what you learned in the class with your friend or with American. Moreover the most important thing is to practice because with no practice you will forget quickly. In addition you need also to find Native American because they can help you in speaking. Finally I think these are the most important advices to help new students.
