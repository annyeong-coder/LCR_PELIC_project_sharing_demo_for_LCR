I'm someone who dreams big and works hard. I'm someone who believes in good energies more than believes in good. I'm someone who loves to read ride her bike and swim. I'm someone who is not always on time. If you ask my best friend to describe me he is going to say something like Are you talking about ANON_NAME_0 The woman who is more unpunctual that a broken watch . Nevertheless I'm someone who is well known for her responsibility. I'm one and many. As Walt Whitman wrote I am large I contain multitudes .
