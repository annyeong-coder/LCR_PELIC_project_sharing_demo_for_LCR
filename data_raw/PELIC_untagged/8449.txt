I think the world would be boring if without synethesia. In my opinion I consider if we have this condition it would be interesting. We could see and feel the music besides we can flavors and colors of words. When we hear something we also can see or taste or feel. In addition every letters have different colors and some of them can be associated with special things such as runny eggs and mashed potato. It's colorful and interesting. I think if we can have this condition we will have a special life.
