No because I believe that in most cases SITTING APART from the society will make you feel that you are strange or you are doing something different. This awful feeling will affect your behavior in a negative way. To explain my point after a period of time you will REJECT the whole society. Also you will not PARTICIPATE with your society in the develpment process. However choosing some nontraditional lifestyles may have some positive points. For example if you choose to grow your own vegetables this will affect your health in a positive way. Therefore it does not matter if you choose to live in nontraditional lifestyle or not but it the important is what is the nontraditional lifestyle you have chosen.
