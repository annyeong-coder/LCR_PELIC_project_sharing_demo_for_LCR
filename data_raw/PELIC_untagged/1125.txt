Personnal Letter October 25 2006 Dear Lingling How are you doing I am very busy on my job but my old computer always has a breakdown . It makes me crazy I think I should buy a new one . I am thinking about buying a laptop or a desktop . I think that a laptop would be better for me for three reasons . First a laptop is smaller than a desktop . It's size like a notebook . I can put it on anywhere in my room . Second a laptop is easier to carry out . I always travel on business so I can bring it to work with battery . Lastly a laptop is more exquisite in appearance . The color is very shiny . I hope you can give me some suggestions . Waiting for your reply . Best Regards
