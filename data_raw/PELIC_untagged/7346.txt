I have already visited Thailand. I rode an elephant and swam on beautiful beaches. But I have never gone to Japan. I want to go Tokyo because I want to buy some Japanese toys. I have ever seen the Colosseum on my vacation. However I have never gone into the Colosseum but I would like to. I would like to see into the Colosseum. I have already traveled China. But I have never traveled Europe yet.
