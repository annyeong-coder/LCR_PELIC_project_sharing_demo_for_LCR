Being a student in the English language institute. ELI is a great opportunity to learn English. I have been studying in order to do well on my Toefl test I chose the ELI because of the recommendations of other friends and my sister. The pie chart shows that 66. 67 Of the students enrolled in the ELI take five courses. Those numbers indicate that most of the students take more than a few courses. I also interviewed with one of my classmate from my writing class and ANON_NAME_0 said They have lots of activity to do in the ELI and I think this is the one of the most important issue to do converstation and improvement on the speaking for the ELI students. Both from the research and the student interview I think the ELI is a good place to study and learn better English. It is important to learn better English to do well in my Toefl test for me and according to the various of researches I think the ELI is a perfect place to advance my Toefl score.
