My kitchen is a small but it is clear. China cabinet is on the left. The window is in the front. The stove is on the right. The drawer is next to it on right. The teakettle and the pot are on the stove. There is a oven under the stove. There is a shaker under the ceiling. The desk is in middle kitchen. I like my kitchen. Of course I hope I have a bigger a kitchen in future.
