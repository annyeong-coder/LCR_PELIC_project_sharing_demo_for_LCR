My apartment is small and has nice view of the huge cemetery. If you walk through the front door you can see a few pieces of furniture such as a sofa TV and some of decoration on the pink wall. But if you look from the balcony you can see a huge beautiful cemetery. For example in the fall season you can see the colorful leaves covering all the graves and seem like a painting. Now in the winter you can see the white snow covering the ground of the cemetery that you can just see the tomb stones. Small and nice view of the cemetery make my apartment lovely and suitable to live in.
