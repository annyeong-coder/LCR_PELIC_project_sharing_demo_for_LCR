Diet Recently years people think skinny equal fashion. Some people want to look skinnier some people want healthier therefore diet is becoming a trend. What is diet It is a limited variety or amount of food that people eat for medical reasons or because people want to lose weight. Are diet and healthy the same The answer can be YES OR NOT. It depends on which way that people use it and how long people diet. Joanne Ikeda is a nutrition counselor at University of California Berkeley. She says overeating and dieting both are problems. Even though nutrition counselors say over dieting is a problem however a lot of people still over dieting. In my opinion people need to control their weight for health reason because overweight causes heart pressure disease. So properly diet is good for health. On the other hand over dieting causes malnutrition. Instead of adequately nourishing their bodies they're cutting down on the amount of food in terms of caloric intake Joanne Ikeda says. In summary people have to change their eating habits. They have to have more vegetables more fruits less junk food. Trying routine of eating fruit and vegetables. Decreasing sweets oily food soda and fast food. Having a healthy and balanced diet.
