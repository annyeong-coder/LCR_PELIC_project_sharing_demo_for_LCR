My favorite Korean Myth is the story of Dan Kun. Dan Kun is thought that he was born between God and bear. There were two animals that wanted to be a human. One was a tiger and another one was bear. Therefore God gave them garlic and wormwood and they were supposed to were garlic and wormwood for 100 days. They started to eat them but tiger gave up eating them around 50 days later. The bear went through with them finally the bear turned into a woman. The woman got married with God and they had a Son whose name is Dan Kun. According to a study the bear and the tiger are thought to be tribes that existed at that time and there was a ware between them. Eventually the bear tribe won to the tiger tribe so the bear tribe conquered Korea continent. Dan Jun is thought to be the king of the bear tribe.
