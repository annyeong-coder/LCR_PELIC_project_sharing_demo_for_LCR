When I was in school I had such wonderful experiences but just on occasions these were encouraged by my teachers. There are classes that you must follow directions history math biology which usually weren't my favorites but others that supposed to be created to make student's creativity takes off. I could have felt be observed and usually constrained by these rules or directions which I still hate. In my opinion directions unify and control thoughts which goes against creativity doesn't it For example in artistic class we had activities where people were doing the same thing helping to develop competition among students when these are made to learn and make you grow while you discover. In these classes there was no beauty perfection or finished work because art is subjective. Thus you cannot have homogeneous results but the reality was other.
