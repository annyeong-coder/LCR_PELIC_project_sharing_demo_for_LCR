Education is one of the important thing in my life. When I am thinking about education I rememberd when my mother used to tell me her stories. She never went to school. 50 Years ago many womens didn t go to school because it wasn t comman in that time. Why is education important for our life If there was no education you wouldn t be able to find any jobs. The better job you have the more many you ll get.
