Every day I have a funny time with my family especially with my first doughter. When I came to the U. S. My doughter called me and asked me where you go and she was repeated every call. Now after I bring my family to the U. S. She always asked any one what your name is and she often said I dont understand what you mean when I teach her. She just kidding. After any meal she told me that she need to eat that makes me crazy!!. Finally she sometimes asked me how far the home is when I ride her from her school and she repeated.
