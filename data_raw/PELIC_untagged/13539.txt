Money spends on research. It's almost always a good investment even when the results of that research are controversial. Although some groups of people don't support in spending money on research I think that every single penny on research is a beneficial investment because the outcome of research will enhance quality of life. The controversy over the research results pales in comparison to new inventions or therapies which use to save lives. One day back when I was in a high school my grandfather had the second stage of lung cancer. Meanwhile cancer was difficult to be killed due to the lack of medical instruments and drugs. My grandfather decided to have an operation to cure the cancer. Unfortunately he died from undergoing an operation. Moreover cancer death rate has been decreasing every year according to Reuters' news. The more money we spend the better living quality we have. If there isn't financial assistance to researchers the number of death will be increasing.
