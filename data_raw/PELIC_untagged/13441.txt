Before I came to Pittsburgh I used to live with my family at home back in Hong ANON_NAME_0. Also I used to be lazy I didn't used to do housework and I didn't used to cook. I used to be healthy I used to do yoga every week and eat nutritious food every day. I used to hang out with my friends and I used to speak Cantonese with them. Nowadays I'm living with my boyfriend here in Pittsburgh. Also I'm working hard I do housework and I cook every week. I'm not really health now I don't exercise and always eat fast food. I'm not used to hang out with classmate and I used to speak English with them.
