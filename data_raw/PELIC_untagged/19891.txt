Actually I did not think about doing many things before I came here. The only reason why I came here it was the English studying. I have been in Pittsburgh for one year. I wished to get the TOEFL score at the middle this year but I could not to get it before this date. At the first I studied at the ELS school at Point Park University. It was clearly to me at the end of my studying of level 7 that this school was not professional as I want from it. After that I changed my school and I have been studying in ELI at University of Pittsburgh for six months. At the beginning I surprised when I saw the different between the two schools. I thought that the ELI school was the super school. But my opinion was wrong in last months and it changed after these months. These days I have been doing a hard work by my self to improve my English because there was diversity of abilities for my teachers in different classes.
