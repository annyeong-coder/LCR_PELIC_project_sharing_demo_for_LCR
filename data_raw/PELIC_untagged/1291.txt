It is a real story I would like to tell. This story is related with the money. Last February or March I'm not sure about the time anyway I was sick. At that time I had a health insurance but I was a new in the Unites States. I had no idea about the policy in the hospital. I went to the UPMC to get some medicine as usual I always have favor I went there and I told them I'm sick and I gave the my health insurance they accepted me to give me medicine because my government was supposed to pay the cost. One month later the UPMC sent a bill for me to pay. It was less amount of money around 210. I sent this bill to the Saudi Culture Mission because they are supposed to pay it. As usual they ignored he bill. This problem of sending bills had continued until I received a real warning bill from the recovery international debt collection. They asked me to pay plenty of dollars otherwise I would be judged in one of the government. They gave me few days to send a check to the centre of debt collection in Switzerland. The only one solution I had was to pay this much amount of money. The amount was around 800. Imagine that from 210 to 800. Finally I paid 800 via wire transfer. After the payment I became poor. I didn't have enough money to pay other utilities so I depended on my sister and brother in law to feed me or help me. That's was the worst money experience I have ever had in my whole life.
