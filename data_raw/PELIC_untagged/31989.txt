Hi I'm ANON_NAME_0 Alshabib. In fact Drawing is my hobby since I was child. When I was child I had been practicing how to draw faces and real pictures. In high school I have begun interested in Architecture. After I graduated from high school I started studying at King ANON_NAME_1 University. By that time I had already started part time job and I had already finished a lot of workshops . In 2010 I graduated from architecture school in KSU. Now I've been living in Pittsburgh since Sep 2011. My goals are to get the TOEFL score then try to apply for CUM.
