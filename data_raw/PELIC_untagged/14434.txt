On Saudi Arabia all the women can't drive a car . My sister dreamed to do it. Then She came to U. S. On Fall 2006 to study her master on Education. She couldn't drive any carthat time. She tried to learn car driving. She didn't pass the driving test fourth times. But The fifth trying she passed it and she got her Driver's License. Now she is a good driver. She can drive any kind of cars. Also she travel to Washington DC by a car. She use the GPS to navigate her about the roads. One time our friend asked her to help her for moving to another building and rent a truck to transfer her furniture. My sister was nervouse but she did it and She said wow now I also can drive a truck! It's amazing . I think on the future she'll be able to drive a race car
