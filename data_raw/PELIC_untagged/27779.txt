Two weeks ago I had the opportunity to watch a movie at a cinema located at the Waterfront. This movies called The Social Network talks about the famous website Facebook which is one of the most popular online network among young people. The film tells the story of Mark Zuckerberg who is the founder of Facebook. It is said that Mark would had stolen the idea of the website to other students who were member of a famous student's society. By greed he would even have betrayed his best friend by excluding him of the project. The Social Network directed by David Fincher is in my opinion a pretty good movie. Indeed although the story may seem monotonous it is interesting to know how Facebook which we use every day was founded. Jesse Adam Eisenberg the main character of the movie looks very similar to Mark Zuckerberg which increases the aspect of reality of the film. However we have to be conscious that the Social Network is also an advertisement and a self glorification of Facebook.
