E Commerce becoming very popular Nowadays it is very easy to buy anything without leaving your home. Yet in 1978 no one could buy or sell any products or services online. However at this time the majority of people are buying online. Many of the companies are depending on E commerce because of reducing the costs selling for twenty four hours and plenty of people are dealing with internet. One of the main factors of increase the profit for the sellers is reducing the costs. First it is not necessary to have a store for selling products or services so you do not need to pay rent for the store. For example my friend was working as a consultant. He brings acceptance for the students to Universities and English language institutes. Also he has a website on the internet. Although he has been making a good business he just works from his home part time. Moreover he does not have any employees to pay salary. If you have a shop you have to have it open and closed at certain times. However selling on line could be for twenty four hours a day. Indeed you have international market. If you are in the U. S you can sell your products to customers in Saudi Arabia. For example four years ago I was in Saudi Arabia and I bought books form Amazon in the U. S. At this time a large proportion of people use the internet. Thus it will be very easy to the sellers to market their products and services. For example if I want to sell my car I might display it in the craigslist. In conclusion a lot of sellers have online services due to no more cost selling for twenty four hours a day and many people need to use internet. Eventually I encourage anyone to create any kind of business online. Because he will begin with the lowest costs free work time and easy way to market his products.
