I like to go to trip. When I was young I've been to the east of America and Toronto for two months. And I've been to Niagara fall since 1994. But I during attended school I've never been to any country for 10 years. And then I finished the high school I've visited my aunt's house in Vancouver since 2004. Go to University I've done volunteer in Vietnam twice since 2007 2008. After that I came to U. S again I've gone to the ELI in Pittsburgh for 3 months. During go to the ELI I've been to New York Philadelphia Atlantic City since Independence Day. But I already have been to New York. I've been to U. S and Canada many times. But I've never been to Europe yet. So I really want to go Europe especially England. One day I'll go to England and Europe too.
