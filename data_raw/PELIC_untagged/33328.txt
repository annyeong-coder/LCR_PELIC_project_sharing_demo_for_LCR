By 2010 Before I went to Las Vegas I was really excited about this trip. I'd never been there before. I hadn't been dreaming to travel there. We had been staying in Monte Carlo hotel when we went there. I'd seen a lot of shows. I had always enjoyed but my friend get injured when we walked for a long distance to see all beautiful hotels in Las Vegas . Hotels has everything such as shopping entrainments restaurant and shows in front of each hotel. This trip changed my thinking about the cities In my opinion I think every hotel is one city . By the time it ended we learned why people call it the city of lights.
