This week we spent talking about foods of different nations. I learned that ANON_NAME_0 grew up in Turkey in Muslim family. Muslims have a family oriented culinary tradition and learn basic skills of cooking from the early age. I also learned that there are certain foods that are taboo. For example pork and alcohol are not allowed by Islam religion. It is important to know cultural differences to avoid uncomfortable situations.
