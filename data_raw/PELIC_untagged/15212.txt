Hi I'm ANON_NAME_0 from Saudi Arabia. I was born in Dammam eastern provenance and I grew up there. Now I'm living in the US and I've been here since June 2008. Last month I thought about building a blog website to talk about my beautiful memories here. So far I've been working on my blog and I've posted a lot of stories about my life in the US. Lately I've been studying English and I've gotten my TOEFL score for my academic admission. In Sep 2008 I joined ELI at the University of Pittsburgh to study English. Since then I've taken five classes and I've met a lot of friendly people. I changed my hobby which used to be soccer but since I moved to Pittsburgh I've learned how to ice skiing. This winter season I've already gone 7 times. In addition a friend of mine taught me how to play Racquetball. Since then I've been playing Racquetball and I've signed up to a competition. I don't have a social life because I'm single but last month I met a beautiful girl. So far we've gone through interesting progress in our relationship. She has studied in CCAC for two years and then in Jan 2009 she transferred to Pitt. Lately I've been working in developing my blog and I've written a lot stories. Check them out soon.
