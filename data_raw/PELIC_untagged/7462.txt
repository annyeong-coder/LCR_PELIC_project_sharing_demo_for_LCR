The topic Playing or watching soccer better than playing or watching football. A lot of people around the world believe that playing and watching soccer is much better than playing and watching football. I think that is true for many reasons such as playing soccer more interesting than playing football playing football is in United States only and playing football is much more dangerous than playing soccer. First of all playing soccer is more interesting than playing football for many reasons. For example the match in football game usually takes about 4 hours and every minute the match stop about 4 times but the match in soccer game usually takes about 2 hours and it does not stop a lot as a result you can feel more enthusiastic and eager to watch more. Second football game is not comprehensive because it is only well known in United States otherwise soccer game is more widespread and it is one of the most famous sports in the world and there are a lot of championships in soccer around the world but in footballs there are some championships in United States only. For example in Syria almost no one likes to play or watch football because they think that it is tedious sport. And the same thing in a lot of country around the world. Third reason is that playing football is more dangerous than playing soccer and a lot of people group football game as kind of fighting not playing sport. For instance there is not any sport around the world that players wear defensive things which is protect them from other players in the game. Finally I think that a lot of people around the world agree with me about how much it is better to play or watch soccer than football because playing soccer more interesting and widespread and safer than playing football.
