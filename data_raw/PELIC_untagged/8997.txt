Tomas said that the law which permitted driving motocycles on highway had been established in Taiwan. I asked when it had been established. He added that it had been established from Nov. 1. I asked whether any kind of motocycles could be driven on highway. He explained that only big motorcycles over 600cc could be permitted. I asked him whether one motorcycle could occupy one lane like other cars. He concluded that it could do like the U. S. Law.
