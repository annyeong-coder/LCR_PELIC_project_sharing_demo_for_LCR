The days in my elementary school were very memorable to me. My teacher Chau who treated students just like his children took care of us patiently and equitably such as our father. And my class which sometimes had some argument or pleasure was also like a family. Every student who became good friends with each other and shared joy or confusion with each other follow Chau's teaching because he was adept in every student and knew what was good for students and what was bad for students. Even the bad student who didn't like to study and played whole day was subdue from his instruction which was very convictive. One bad student called May who usually spend his most time to become a rogue and didn't come to class gradually tried to study hard and spend time to be a student because Chau's teaching. Now the good relationship isn't stopping.
