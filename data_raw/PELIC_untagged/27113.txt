I was studying hard to prepare myself for my driver licenses. I got my drivers license as soon as I possibly could after my 18th birthday. I was excited to go and take my drivers test. Eventually I had to go for my road test along with three other students. We felt like lambs about to get slaughtered. Both of the other students failed right away. When my turn came I started the car fine drove for a few minutes and felt confident. But a few seconds later the examiner braked suddenly and yelled Look at what you are doing. I parked safely on the side of the street puzzled. What did I do I wandered. He said Look at the roundabout. I looked behind me. I didn't see a roundabout just a four way intersection where he yelled at me. Turned out that at the middle of the intersection there was a tiny dot painted on the road which meant that a new roundabout was in construction. So I had failed my test. But I didn't give up. I took it again by preparing properly and listening to tips from my friends and I passed it.
