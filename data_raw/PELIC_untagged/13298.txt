Thinking about future is interest thing even though there is no answer and it is unpredictable. Perhaps most people do this when they are lying on the bed. I often think about myself and future very much and imagine what my future will be. A dream of owner in the trade company had been already decided when I was a middle school student. Now I am attending and studying for English in the University of Pittsburgh for my future. Though I am now hard and difficult to study English I am trying considering my good future. After 20 years I might be one of the most renowned leaders of company. For my dream I will graduate my university in Korea and I will go to a graduate school M. B. A. In the U. S. A. To achieve my dreams I will have to persistently pursue my academic studies even though it is extremely hard. When I have my degree I will get a job with a big company I will accumulate skill and experience attending company and have my own business a few years later. After I can support myself financially I will donate 30 of my salary for poor people. It sounds difficult however I will never forget the self promise when I thought in elementary school.
