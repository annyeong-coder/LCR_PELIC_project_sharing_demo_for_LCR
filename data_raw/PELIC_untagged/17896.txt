Dear confused I think your love story is very complex and I hope do not have the same in the future. If I understand you have two big problems You love Jim the top in your heart and you parents can't accept to marry someone who isn't Japanese. First of all the suggestion I have to give you is to talk your parents seriously about your love and your life in the future maybe they can unterstand you. In addition you can talk to Jim about your culture your family and your relationship. For example you love him so much and want to spend the rest your life with you. But your parents don't want to marry someone who isn't Japanese. Try to sacrifice your love because the most important in this life is your parents maybe you can get another love in the future after a long sadness. Love come from everywhere also you can leave away from Jim and stay with your family becuase you said I'm really close to my parents. I Hope my suggestions can help you to take a good decision about your parents or Jim. Thank
