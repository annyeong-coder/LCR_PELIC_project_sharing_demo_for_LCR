Learning a second language is a good idea. But although speaking two or more languages is important speaking English is the most important of all. Some of the benefits are that you can find a good job to know new people or traveling without problems for the language. One of the benefits of Learning English is that you can find a better job. For example if you speak English you can work in many countries where the English is the first language or you would work in your own country making business with people of all the world because the English is the most important languange in the world. Another important thing is that you can know new people like new friends or even you would know to your husband or wife. The last thing that I consider important for Learning English is that you can travel around the world without problems for the language. For example you would visit many countries where the English is spoken or sometimes you would visit some country where the English is not the first language but there are a lot of people that speak English. In conclusion I think that learn English is very important because you can find better oportunities and you would be a person with more culture.
