There are a lot of positive effects of sports. First of all sports make our life more exciting. I like to watch baseball games or soccer games. Before I watch the games I am full of expectation of the games. While I am watching an important baseball game or soccer game I can't take my eyes off the game. After I watch the game I can't forget the main scene of the game for a long time. Secondly sometimes a sport game gives us stronger impression than a movie. Actually I was moved to tears two times while I was watching Beijing Olympic Games. Finally international games such as World Championships in Athletics Olympic Games World cup give us many topics for conversations. Even when we meet a person of few words we can easily have conversation with him or her because most people watch the international sports game. Sports give many benefits to us and they make us happy.
