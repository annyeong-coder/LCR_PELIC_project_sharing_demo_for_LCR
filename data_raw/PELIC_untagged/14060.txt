One of my classrooms is bright and sunny. This cheers me up. The second room is little bit dark during the day. I figured out what the university should do for it. It is better if they throw away the old lamp and they buy another one bigger to light up the room. The third one has a problem in the air condition I tried to turn it on the last time but it was broken.
