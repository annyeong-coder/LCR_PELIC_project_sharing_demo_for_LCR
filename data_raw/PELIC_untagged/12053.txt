My home city and Pittsburgh A Introduction B contrast 1 weather 2 number of universities 3 the nature C comparison 1 food 2 the design of buildings 3 there is no sea D conclusion I have been in Pittsburgh for nine months. I like the life here because being in another city from your original city is a wonderful experience. The amazing thing About the experience is finding the differences such as the weather number of universities and the nature and similarties such as the food and the design of building. The weather in Pittsburgh is totally different from Riyadh. In Pittsburgh it snows and very cold in winter and it is wet in the summer . In addition it rains often in all the seasons in Pittsburgh. On the other hands it never snows in Riyadh in winter and the climate is dry in the summer
