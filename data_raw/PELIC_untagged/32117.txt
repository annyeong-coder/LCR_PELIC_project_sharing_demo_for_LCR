Omaimah Qadhi Feb 26th 12 Writing 4 Cause and Effect free writing 100 years back The invention of electrical power had influenced life after then. The reason for this success was by Tomas Edison who tried several times before he ended up with his beneficiary discovery. He is believed to be the inventor of the lightbulbe. He use previous inventors trials and results and continued working on them. There were many experiments done using the platinum and other elements. However he tried to use the carbon in his experiments. The first successful test was on October 22 1879 it lasted 13. 5 Hours. Edison continued to improve this design and by November 4 1879 filed for U. S. Patent 223 898 granted on January 27 1880 for an electric lamp using a carbon filament. Because of this invention the whole world was changed. In the following paragraphs three main effects resulted from this invention will be discussed. First because electricity is very useful it is used hospitals in everything. For example patients in ICU Intensive Care Unit are connected to machines 24 hours. However if this power disrupted for any reason man patients would die. Also physicians in operations use electrical power for using their machines and instruments. Blood bank is where donated blood is kept. If the power went down for seconds blood would be not usable for transfusion to patients who need it. Second because of electricity people can keep their food in the refrigerator. If there were no power people will get sick from eating ruined food. It will also be impossible to by fresh vegetables and fruits. Poultry products will have to be prepared daily and only for each day otherwise it will be a big waste of money because there will not be a place to keep it fresh and eatable without electricity. Third all factories and plants work using electricity. As a result to that if there were a lack of power for minutes it would be a huge economic effect. The worldwide economic will be seriously influenced.
