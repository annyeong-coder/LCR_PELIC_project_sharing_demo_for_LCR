I spent my last long weekend traveling Atlanta which is located in the south of the states. The event impressed me mostly is the world of Coca cola which is named the happiness factory. We had a 4D movie took picture with polar bear and drink free soft drinks. What a lot of fun there! I recommend strongly to take your children to visit the happiness factory where located in the southern.
