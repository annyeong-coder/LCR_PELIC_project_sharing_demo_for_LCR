HiI am ANON_NAME_0. I built this site for making friends who have the same hobby with me. I enjoy traveling. I have traveled around almost all over the China except Xinjiang and Yunnan. And I also have been to Nepal and India. I used to travel by myself when I was a student. I have been dreaming about an around the world trip since I was 20 years old. When I was in the Mongolia plain I saw a shooting star flight over the dark sky. At that time I promised me a reward that I would travel around China before 2008 and travel around world before 2012. I have been actualizing my dream for 7 years. I will continue it.
