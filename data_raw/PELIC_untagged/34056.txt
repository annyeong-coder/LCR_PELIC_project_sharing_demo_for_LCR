After I graduated from King ANON_NAME_0 University . I came to United States in 2011 with my dad. We went DC. It was a wonderful trip. I worked in Riyadh Bank. I quit my job since April 2011. I loved my work but I have followed my mom advised to improve my English language. I have studied in ELI since May 2012. I have lived in Pittsburgh. I've made a lot of friends from different country's.
