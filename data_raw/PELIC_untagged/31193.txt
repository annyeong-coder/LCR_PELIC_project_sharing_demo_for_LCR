Causes of Happiness They say that money can buy happiness. It's true if I have money I can buy anything I want. But to achieve happiness there are a lot of factors other than money success good health and family can achieve happiness. For example lately I've been in money crises because I didn't get a scholarship yet. So of course having a scholarship means that all my payments will be covered and the source of that is the money. Therefore I'll be the happiest person in the world in that moment. Being successful also can make anyone happy and self confident. It could happen when getting a promotion at work. Or getting a job with high position like being the chief of residents in a hospital or being a manager of a big company. All of these can make anyone happy but with a lot of responsibilities. In addition remaining in good health makes me happy and secure when I see sick people especially in my field while I'm working in the hospital. Sometimes I feel what if I don't have my health and being sick all the time . I'll be miserable because of the pain and the dependence on other people. So thank God for being healthy. Also having family is a great gift from God. When I see the orphans or people without family I feel sad about them because I really appreciate having my family and being surrounded by them makes me feel happy and safe. Like when my mom gets worried about me and takes care of me. Also my dad with his kindness and hard working to earn money for us. All of these are examples of achieving happiness through the family. In conclusion we can see that money can cause happiness but it's not the happiness itself. Happiness can be achieved even with the poorest person in the world if that one is satisfying about his or her life.
