I have one close friend I've known since 12. We havd many same points but different points too. Both of us are a kind of girls who like travelling to other countries. In 2005 we went to Japan together and we are planning to go to Japan again in this september. And we are also good eaters who like eating delicious food. When I was in Korea which is my hometown we usually went to good restaruants unless we didn't have enough money. But Sometimes we had a small funny arugment when we decided to have drinks or desserts because we usually shared them. She's the one who likes sweets especially milk chocolates that is pretty sweet for me. Whlie I like bitter and soar ones which is not her favourite. One surprising thing was that it wasn't a problem at all then. She is a friend who has a sense of humour so every small argument turned into laughing then. That's why I like her so much as my close friend.
