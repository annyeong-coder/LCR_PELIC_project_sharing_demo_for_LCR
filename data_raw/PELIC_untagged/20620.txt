From my point of view the parent especially who are old enough usually don't believe and completely agree about what their children did because the huge differences in thinking between them as well as generation gap. It is clear in Yolanda story that her mother tried to persuade her daughter in many things but Yolanda was not convinced. Also Yola tried to keep her readings about poem a secret from her mother. The general framework of story is the mother was conservative pure and simple. On the hand Yolanda was falling in love and she didn't want her mother to know about this indelicacy. The mother anticipated that her daughter will be the best when every thing revealed front of the people about reading the poem. The mother tried to convince the attendance in the auditorium that her daughter was poet and she achieved the hope of her mother. Also the mother told some attendance about what happened for her daughter when they went to NY and she drew the people by reciting a poem. Mother threw her daughter off by her presence and Yloa did not expect that. Yola was uneasy watching her lover talk to her mother while she was reading the poem.
