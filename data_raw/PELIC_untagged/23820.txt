First time I saw Salil I was walking behind him and his friends. I couldn't stop to see his big pants hiding his extremely thin body. I supposed he was 17 or 18 but after many beers I knew he was 21 and could have killed some one defending his nation. He was from Israel and he had finished his military service just few weeks before our meeting. I started to complain about the governments that oblige young man to join the armed forces. He was so mad with me saying that every country have different needs. He spent one hour trying to convince me. Salil was telling me that in order to defend its borders Israel has a constant military activity since 1948. Women and men have to enter the military when they are 18. And we Salil said should be ready any time the government requires our services . Even though he agreed with his country laws he was telling me how he renounced his college classes forgot the afternoons with the friends postpone his artistic interests and lack of things that he was dreaming about. If the government decide that a war is coming and this is very common in Israel they have to pack a gun instead of a bunch of books just like Salil did.
