I have read about Is Marathon Running Bad for the Heart . It published on May 23 2012 by Gretchen Reynolds that is on The New York Times website. This character shows the marathon running or strong activity are healthy or not. The author used some studies that say marathon running and racing are slim to kill or damage the heart but there are rare chance to happen. At the beginning he wrote studies that published in news reporter because the physicians are not required to report the local health authorities. The first report was about comparison between marathon racing in 2009 and 2002 and there were small changes of dying during the marathon running or after 24 hours since finishing the race. Next report was by Dr. ANON_NAME_0 he found helpful findings that reinforce his thought which the person who runs in marathon running is at slightly higher risk of suffering a heart attack. Also there are some subjects play an important role in heart disease as Genetic virus and bad diet. At the end of character the author mentioned several recommendations about getting a good health by Dr. ANON_NAME_0.
