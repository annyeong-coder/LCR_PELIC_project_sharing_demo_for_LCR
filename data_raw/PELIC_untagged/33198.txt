In my opinion I think the Hikikimory are the most unusual people. All the other groups in the text have their special society to live in however the Hikikimory are the only people who live alone. Their isolation set them apart from the others. They withdraw from any social environment and reject any one want to share them. Their isolation can cause many problem on their real society such as economic problems.
