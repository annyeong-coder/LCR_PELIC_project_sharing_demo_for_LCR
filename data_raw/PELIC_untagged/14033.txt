In August 2004 I've been in Morocco for two weeks with my best friends. We visited three cities Casablanca Rabat and Marrakech. Every city was special. First we spent three days in Casablanca. We enjoyed beaches there and we rode horses. We also visited many famous places. Second we went to Rabat the capital of Morocco. We ate traditional food in several restaurants. We had a lot of fun there. Finally in Marrakech we enjoyed a very exciting tour to Djemaa el Fna it is a square and market in meddle of the old city. We saw the magicians peddlers of traditional medicines and snake charmers who will pose for photographs for tourists. It was a wonderful trip.
