How a Person Successfully Met That Challenge When we have a challenge we can succeed easily more than other people. I have heard about challenge and success in my life and I think that success is not a result of luck. Success is result of one's efforts and challenge is necessary requirement for one's success. At least most people might meet a challenge more than one time in their life. In order to meet a challenge successfully we should have a conviction of success. When we meet impending crises we might strive for passing through it and we could overcome for our success. For example my mother became widow when she was 33 years old. She had four children and didn't have money because her husband was dead by car accident. He didn't prepare anything for his family. If my mother didn't meet the worst case she could not have succeeded. Her challenge was only earning much money for her children. My mother worked to support her children and it was her challenge. I think that my mother was successful to take care of her children. My sisters and I admire my mother all the time. In conclusion it is important to have a conviction of success. We don't need to worry about success before doing challenge. We need to have 100 conviction about success. Successful people could insist that all of failures are one of process of success. Successful people have common feature which isn't afraid of failure. Also we should not forget an anecdote about successful people which stimulated us to strive for challenge.
