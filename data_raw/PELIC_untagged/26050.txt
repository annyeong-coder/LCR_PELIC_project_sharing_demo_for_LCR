You should visit Libya because it has many beatiful places. You shouldn't take warm clothing. The weather is warm most of the year. But you had better not wear short clothing in the public places. People in my culture don't like that. If someone invite you to lunch and you need second helping of food. You ought to ask them because they will be so happy you like thier food. You shouldn't worry about the money. The prices in my country are not expensive. If you like the desert you had better to find tourism guide. Most of people who live in the desert cann't speake English. You sholdn't shake hands when you first meet someone especily a man. But if you meet woman you ought to shake hands. And of course you will be welcom in libya.
