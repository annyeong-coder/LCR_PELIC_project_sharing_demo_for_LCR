I went to the Tanger outlet yesterday. It was really nice. I picked up many clothes. I actually looked up form something special to me. I chose one collection from Adiddas they just btought it up online and I hoped to find them there. I moved around the whole outlet to find Addidas sore and I forgot to look at drictory to save time. Finally I turned around and found it. I found my collection and bought them immediatley. I will really do over this shopping soon since I found all my stuff in a special price.
