President Bush and an Arabian man are plying a different game against each other. The Arabian man has sharp features and dark hair dressed up in the Arabian Gulf clothing. Since President Bush is playing checkers and the Arabian man is playing chess as a result they don't understand each other. However it is widely believed that both chess and checkers are played by smart people. But in this case it is not about who is smarter than who it is about understanding each other. By the end of the day they will never understand each other unless they play the same game.
