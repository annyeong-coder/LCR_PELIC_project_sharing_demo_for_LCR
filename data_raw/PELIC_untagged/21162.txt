ANON_NAME_0 Kai Shek Memorial Hall is a famous tourist attraction where is a public park in Taipei City. It is also close to my home so when I was a child my mother often took me to stroll in the park. ANON_NAME_0 Kai Shek is a historical person who was the first president in Taiwan. There are three buildings in the ANON_NAME_0 Kai Shek Memorial Hall. First one is the main memorial hall which includes constant displays and ANON_NAME_0 Kai Shek's bronze statue. The others are National Theater and National Concert Halls that are two of the most important art theatres in Taiwan. I had joined a chorus whose conductor is my music teacher. Our chorus had a performance at the National Concert Hall in 2004 when I was a sophomore. It was a great experience for me. Therefore ANON_NAME_0 Kai Shek Memorial Hall is a significant place to me.
