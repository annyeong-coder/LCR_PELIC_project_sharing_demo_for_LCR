If I become ELI president I will make a room just only for ELI students. I think some ELI students should often move every class. If I became ELI president I'll change the time schedule. 09 00AM is very early. If I am ELI president I'll ask new 100 parking lots only for ELI students. If I become ELI president I'll ask for taking one outside class per a week. I think it is important not only to learn knowledge but also to be healthy. If I am ELI president I will ask for going a trip to the other state.
