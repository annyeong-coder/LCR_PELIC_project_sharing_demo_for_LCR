I have been most influenced by Jang Young Sil who was a great scientist about five hundred years ago. There are two reasons why I was influenced by him. Firstly He overcame the block of hierarchy. Even though he was from a slave family he didn't give up his talent and endeavor. Finally he was appointed as a scientist who had a high position in the palace. Especially I was touched by his persistent endeavor. Whenever I want to stop or give up my study or work I always think about him. Then I make up my mind to continue my job even though it is difficult or hard. Secondly I was moved by his attitude toward his mother. Even though he made a great success in his job he always thought about his mother. Because his father passed away when he was a child his friends made a fun of him about it and the fact that he was a slave. Regardless of it he always loved his mother and tried not to forget the love of her mother after he entered the palace. My value about how I treat my mother was formed by his attitude toward his mother. For example I call my mother at least three times a week and try to follow her advice.
