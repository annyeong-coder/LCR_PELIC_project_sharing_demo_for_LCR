I would like to let you know some useful travel advices. If you focus on the economical travel you had better shop around for a cheap ticket. If it is possible to buy a book to contain the specific information about the city it is very useful to you. When you arrive at the city use the transportation rather than taxes. If you focus on the educational travel go to the museum famous places and cites of the city. You can learn a various culture and custom. Before you start the travel you had better make a schedule. It can prevent you from wasting time. Finally if you focus on the funny travel do not afraid of trying new food. The food of one country reflects their thought habit and so on. So it will refresh your body and mind. It is also a good way to meet a new friend of the city that you will visit. Now It is your choice what you have in mind. I hope you enjoy your travel.
