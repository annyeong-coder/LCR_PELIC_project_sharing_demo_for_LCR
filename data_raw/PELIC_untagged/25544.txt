One day we went to a Chinese restaurant at Waterfront. I have visited this restaurant before so I am familiar with the menu. When we reached there the restaurant was full of people. We waited for 30 minutes to have a table. Then the waiter came and gave us the menu. After locking at the menu I was in a dilemma because I forgot the meal that I had last time but I decide any way. After that the waiter took the menu and gave us some water and a cup of coffee for each of us. When our meals came my meal was the best in the style. It had some chicken broccoli spice and some vegetables. After we started eating our food my mouth started burning because of the spice that is in the meal. I did not know that it has that much of spice because I chose it incorrectly. Then I started to put blocks of ice to cool it off. Finally I finished eating the meal but my mouth was in a fire for more than 20 minutes.
