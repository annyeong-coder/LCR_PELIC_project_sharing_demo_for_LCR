HI I am Hank. I am 27 years old. I am a smoker. I have been addicted by cigarette for 14 years. I have to write something for introducing myself. Actually I prefer to watch NBA games rather than write my homework. But sadly if I don't finish the profile before Thursday ANON_NAME_0 will give me a huge giant or great egg on the record of my grade. I was born and grew up in Taiwan. When I was a child I always played outside. I had never thinked about what will I do in the future in my child life. I remembered that someday a teacher asked us what you were gonna be. I said that I was going to be a good father. My teacher was laughing and said you are just 10 year old kid and you think too farther then I said that how could you ask a unknown question to a 10 year old kid My teacher got angry. Because of that I had to stand at back of the calssroom during the class time. While I was standing the other classmates laughed at me. What a shame. A lot of friends of mine asked me that why do you study English . I always answer that I am going to go to New York to be a cadger so I have to learn Ehglish . Right now I have been living and studying English in the U. S for 4 months but I have not gone to New York because I think my English is not good enough to be a cadger. I can't confirm how well I do. I has tried my best to deal with my homework and the study since I got here. New York City I am coming.
