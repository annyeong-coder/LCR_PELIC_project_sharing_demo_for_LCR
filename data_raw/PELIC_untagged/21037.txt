I have ever visited NewYork. It has many of the tallest buildings in the United States. It has also some of the most wonderful buildings in the world. In addition it has one of the most famus statue in the world. It is statue of liberty. Moreover it has the biggest economy in the world. Finally it has some of the beautiful museums in the United States.
