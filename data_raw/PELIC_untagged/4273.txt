It always has been a great wonder to see some pyramids in the picture. How on earth was it possible to build such a huge structure on desert At least one thing is certain that a great number of people must have worked there to build them. And I think it might not have been a desert where the pyramids are located now. Here are a few reasons why I think like this. The king of Egypt who was called Pharaoh is believed to have had a great power over people almost like a god. With this reason he could have used so many people to build such a big tomb. Another reason is that without wood and water people could not have built the pyramids. As the competition between kings to build a bigger pyramid went heated it might have led to deforestation and at last a desert.
