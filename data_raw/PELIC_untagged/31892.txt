Dear Samy How are you I write this letter to let you know that I am taking training in Climb. I remember our younger years. When we went every summer to the mountains. We had a good physical condition. I have been missing those days. Right now I have felt very tired when I finish the classes. I have been taking that class every Saturday at night. I hope that everything is going good for you. I have waited news about you a long time and you have not sent me anything. Regards ANON_NAME_0
