Since I gain weight I am on a diet. But I found a nice cupcake shop on Ellsworth avenue the day before yesterday. I wavered in my judgment if I eat the cupcakes which looks very pretty or not. And finally I ate 3 cupcakes. After that I gained weight again. . Now I think I should not have eaten the 3 cupcakes. 3 Cupcakes were too much for me. Or I might have run after eating cupcakes.
