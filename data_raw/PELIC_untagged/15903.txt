There is a probe in Korea from long ago A man must not enter the kitchen. Our ancestors believed if a man entered the kitchen the man would not succeed in his life. It means if a man was concerned about housework and he could not do great things for the society or nation. In other words housework is a female part and outdoor work is a male job. There are male and female job in Korea from long ago. Actually most men who are forty years or older have not done work at home. However it has proved incomplete and biased these days as Walter Lippman said Stereotypes of social groups invariably prove incomplete and biased. Men who do housework and outdoor work well is on the increase. Far from working any failure at the outdoor work they do great work. For example a pastor who is at my church in Korea often said his experiences. He has had many titles as a pastor a chief of churches and a director of college but he does not neglect his housework. He strongly recommends doing housework to his saints. He also washes dishes and cleaning room. He knows there are not male and female parts. Next I know a person who is my brother in law is very busy with outdoor work. He is a university professor the manager of Duranno Father School and deacon and teacher at the church. Even though he is busy he does his best to do housework. He often washes dishes makes dishes and cleans his room. Therefore the stereotype a man concerned about housework and the man could not do great things for the societies or nation proves incomplete and biased.
