I was thinking about a topic such as The interaction between electro magnetic fields and the human body . Willing to argue that there is no scientific proof of correlation between the use of mobiles and the incidence of some kind of cancer I think that good key words could be electro magnetic fields with the logical AND maybe also between electro and magnetic biomedical interaction or interaction mobile or cell AND phones experiments correlation cancer epidemiology .
