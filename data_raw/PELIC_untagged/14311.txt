When I was a university student I often played soccer. If I were rich I would buy a new car. Unless I had studied hard I would not have become a doctor. In case I am injured I will go to the hospital. Because the tickets were cheap I often went to the PNC Park. After I return to Japan I will start to work. As soon as I go back home I have to start my homework. Once I will return to Japan I will have less chance to speak English. Before I go back to Japan I will visit to San Francisco. Although I go to bed early I cannot get up early in the morning.
