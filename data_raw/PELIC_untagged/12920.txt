My country like the other countries in the third world has big problem with the transportation system. Our transportation system is mess. The solution of this problem is shared between the government and the people There are two solutions that can be done for this problem. The first solution the government should establish good infrastructure to the transportation system. They should buy new buses and they should provide bus stops every where because when we do not have special place for the buses to stop people cannot find bus easily. Transportation from city to city in our country is a big problem because our cities are distributed on large region. The government should provide trains that connect between the main cities in our country. Also the government should provide subways at least in our capital city. In this time the mentioned solution have the ability to fix the transportation system. Then in the future we can provide more options like providing online services of the buses schedule and special number for each bus. The second solution the government and the people should cooperate to make the transportation system succeed. The government should encourage the people to take care of the transportation system. This includes the drivers and the people who rid the buses. The driver should take car of the bus that he is driving and we should provide rules for this when driver make some thing bad for the bus he should be punished. People ridding the buses should take care of the buses. They must not break or steal any thing. The government has to educate the people to do this. Transportation in my country is big problem. The people and the government have the responsibility to solve this problem.
