Pittsburgh is a peaceful state. When I lived in my country. I lived in a capital city it's different in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh is not a hurry state. Drivers almost don't honk the horn. But in my country drivers usually honk the horn a lot. The traffic in Pittsburgh is very comfortable. I never saw the traffic jam in here. In the night Pittsburgh is so quiet that is more different in my country. I feel good and I love to live in Pittsburgh.
