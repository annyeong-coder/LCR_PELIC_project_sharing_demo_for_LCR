Sometimes a little friend is a great friend I read a fable about two unique mice when I was a kid. One of them was blind and another was deaf. Therefore they had many problems in their lives. The blind mouse often fall down to a river and the deaf mouse could not realize something even if a cat got closer. However the biggest challenge is that nobody wanted to make friends with a mouse who is blind or deaf. One day they met each other. Immediately they had recognized the worth from both sides. Soon they went out to find something to eat. At the time the blind mouse focused on the voices of the environment and the deaf mouse was capable of looking around and didn't worry about a cat. Obviously they found great friends although they were little friends as other mice considered.
