Al Edi Celebrate today I want to write about Eid alfeter . All the Muslim people celebrate in Eid alfeter . What they do in that' day . In the first they they buy a new clothes and buy some candy for the children. Next they wear a new clothes in the morning of 10 01 every years Then in the morning they go to the mosque to pray alfajer then al Eid pray. After the pray there are many thing to do depend on your city but I will tell you about Jeddah Makkah and Almdenah because they near from each other. They after the pray have a traditional things example to eat a traditional food same depyaza it's kind of candy . In the night of that day every body go visit each other. Always that happened every year for 3 days. Generally all of the Muslim people like it.
