Thesis College students should have complete freedom to choose their own courses. I agree this opinion. I think college students are responsible individuals who must be allowed to make their own choices. It is important thing for them. Some courses are not in their major and they have no interest in them. If they haven't complete freedom to choose their own courses those courses are waste time for them If they want to specialize in their major field they should have the possibility to do. Still I think most students would work fairly well in order to learn the subject.
