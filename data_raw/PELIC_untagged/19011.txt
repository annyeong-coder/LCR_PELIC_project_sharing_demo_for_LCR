The Travel of My Dreams!. . . I always dream about traveling around the entire world but obviously with my husband! First of all I'll start going to Europe traveling around Spain Madrid Barcelona Ibiza my parents and my sister went there in this vacations and they told me it was amazing! They said the architecture was georgeus and delicious food I love Spain food specially the Paella this dish is like an little spicy rice with seafood pork and some greens so in this moment I can imagine us eating paella in a restaurant in Madrid! Wow amazing! After that I would like visit Italy Rome the Pizza Tower take a trip in a gondola around Venecia with my husband and hearing some musician in the trip! During my visit to Italy I'd go to Vaticano and pray in a mass with the Pope!. Later we can go to Paris the lovely and romantic Paris meet the Eiffel Tower take a lot of pictures walking in Paris and maybe go to Harrods to buy some clothes! Why not . Later in this night we can go to Moulin Rouge and the next day we definitely go to Notre Dame cathedral in the afternoon we can go to Champs Elysees and finishing this day enjoying the sunset. In all of my trips I usually go to the museums because I enjoy watching the art and the different cultures so in this trip there is not a exception off course I'll go to Louvre!. I heard that Switzerland it's a lovely place and I would like to visit this country because in the news said is the best place to live in the entire world. At this point we can finish this trip in England visit London taking a tour in the red bus then we can try drink an English tea! I think traveling around the world is the best opportunity to meet different kind of cultures and visit amazing places so I think Europe it's a good idea for start my vacations later. . . . More places in the entire world to visit!!!
