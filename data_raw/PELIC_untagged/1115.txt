Moatz is one of the best friends I've ever had in my life. We have been friends since we were in the first grade and we have been claassmets since that time untill we had graduated from high school. Moatz is a very handsome gyu when you see him you'll notice his eyes wich it look very flashing and staring so you you will be scared. You can see a peaceful when you look at his broad shaped face. His brown hair is very long and soft. He has a full lipped mouth he attract the girls with his pink lip. His voice is very manly and he talk eith a very booming voice. Moatz's hand looks very funny to me and I used to make jokes in his hands because he have a very big hand we used to call it Shrek's hand. He is a white person and this is very unusuall in our culture because most of us have that middle eastern color so we used to surname or call him the syrian because these people are white. Moatz is a very slim person even though he eats alot
