Writing 5U June 1 2010 Cheongjae Last Name Many people have believed the birth order is a crucial factor to affect a personality. For example first born children may be usually more responsible and mature than later children because they have often taken care of younger children while their parents are busy working. In addition only children may be usually more impolite and irresponsible than children with brothers or sisters because they do not have to consider others in their family. However I have observed frequently that some children have very different personalities although they have the same birth order. Therefore I think that the inherent personality can be developed by a variety of factors such as environmental and biological causes. Even though the personality could slightly depend on the birth order environmental causes are also important to develop their characteristics. The scientific facts have been also proposed that some of the people might born with a gene that leads to be responsible and mature early so we can find responsible and mature children although they are not first born. In conclusion I think that the birth order is not the only thing to result in the development of humans' characteristics.
