After I moved to United States I really regreat about my fault in the past. Why did I live meaninglessly I should have lived like mayfly day by day. At that time I always complaint to my situation. I ought not to have complaint to myself. I should have had positive mind because I had a family a lot of friends and acquantances. They are driving force of my life. I could have been grateful about my situation. If so I would be happy about the life of US. Also I might have prepared more about studying English. Now I have tough time to learn English. If I had practiced English more I could have gotten better grade in this institute.
