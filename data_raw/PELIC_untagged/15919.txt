Newspapers frequently announce that drunk people make many kinds of mishap. Similarly alcohol sometimes has a negative effect on our life. Of these the accident rate of young people is high according to the report from Supreme Prosecutor's Office Korea annual report 2005 . Thus the government should keep the minimum legal drinking age at 21 instead of lowering it to 18. Most people turning eighteen do not have the maturity of judgment and enough life experience yet. At this age 18 they just graduate from high school. Thus they become independent from their parents for the first time. This means that they want to enjoy what they really like to do and they do not have enough ability to control their reasoning power. They also will try to do something new without any consideration. One can be alcohol which can make people misjudge a situation that is a person can lose his judgment by it even though he has the maturity of judgment and a lot of experience. For example in my country there are a few alcohol related accidents in campus and around university every year. Freshmen drink with their seniors but they do not know how much they drink seniors let them drink as much as they want. In addition some people bet who drinks the most or some people encourage others to drink more. Then they lose control of themselves and they act boldly. These daring acts cause dangerous accidents. To sum up governments should not amend the current law about the drinking age because young people need to have the ability to control themselves after drinking and life experience. If they are allowed to drink before having the capacities to control themselves they will make trouble.
