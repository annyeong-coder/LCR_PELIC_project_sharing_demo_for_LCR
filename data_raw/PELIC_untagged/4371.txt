These days I have a difficulty for deciding my job . Before graduating the university I should have determined my job more carefully. At that time I recieved an offer to work the bank but refused that suggestion to try other job I wanted to have. After all I succeeded to have that job but I realized that job wasn't what I really wanted to be. When I received that offer I could have tried that bank job opening. The suggestion might have been an opportunity in my life. Moreover I could have had a high salary. Now I know that decision can't be back.
