Many things cheer me up in my home such as an email from Japan that my family and my friends give back to me a room that I cleaned it up a cup of tea or some glasses of beer after I get through with a lot of homework a chat with my husband every morning before we go out and chipmunks that always show up around my apartment. So I am very happy however I would like to get a TV. When I go home I always turn the radio on. Listening radio let us build up listening skills but I want other entertainment in my home. By the way I will go back to Japan to change my visa status and to attend my close friend's wedding reception in August. I have to pick out a gift for her in the U. S. It is really fun to think over the gifts and the souvenirs so it also cheers me up. Moreover recently I am writing down many things that I would like to bring from Japan and my husband and I are talking them over. After we come back to U. S. Again my home would be much more comfortable than now.
