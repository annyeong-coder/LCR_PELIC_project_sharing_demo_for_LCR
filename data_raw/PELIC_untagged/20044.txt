When I was a university student without a stable financial situation I had a foolish experience about a little money. At the day I went to Karaoke with my friend and parked my car in a parking lot where we need to pay parking fee. The parking system was automatic and unmanned so it is designed so that we cannot move a car until we pay the fee to prevent from violation of parking. After enjoying Karaoke I mistakenly paid for the next parking space of my car but I could not get refund it and I had to pay again for my parking. Then we found that both of us didn't have enough money to pay the parking fee. We tried to find a few coins in my car and checked our purse again and again. But still it' was little to pay the fee. After we thought for a while we took taxi to my house to get money and came back by bicycle to pay the parking fee. After all having little extra money generated more uneconomical situation to me. Since I had this happening it becomes one of my philosophies to have always more money than I am supposed to use.
