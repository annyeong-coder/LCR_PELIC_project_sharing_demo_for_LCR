The foreign movies are a good way to learn about a different country or culture. They describe the real life as can as possible. Also they try to reflect a great image about their countries. Some times they just focus about the good things and amazing culture but I think that's good for every country because the foreign people want to know the important things about the country not the darkness side. For example Brave Heart that movie talked about Scotland. It discussed the war of freedom the power of people and the meaning of the freedom. It was a gorgeous movie and deserved to win many Oscars. In addition it got the impressive of the audiences until now. I think the directors have to use the movies to reflect the culture and the traditional of their countries to all over the world.
