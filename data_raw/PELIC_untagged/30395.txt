Everyone uses internet for a reason or another. In Fact it's rarely to fine a home without internet service now days. However internet has many files and programs that cost money for anyone who wants to have. Such as songs application and texts. For expensive price they coast many internet users tend to download these programs by using another way to avoid paying money. Even so this way may save their money I believe that kind of download is illegal and cause many of disadvantages. Most people who support free downloading will justify their attitude as saving their money and not wasting it on programs and files that are not worth all that price. Maybe saving money is good offer that free downloading gives. However most of people who support free downloading are not awareness of heavy loss they cause by taking programs they should pay for. The companies and agents who responsible of these files and programs are menaced of losing their money. As a result they will stop producing programs and files that people need. It's true that sharing programs is one feature that free downloading can gives for internet users. Not only for money it save but also for the fast and easy way to get these files and programs. However free downloading considered as a stealing as long as these files have copyrights. So having these files without permeation or paying is trespass on rights. It shows irrespective of other's properties. Moreover it is no fair for other people who use to follow the rights and pay for things they download. In my opinion this way of downloading is illegal. I believe there should be internet authorities that set punishment. Also all people should be aware of loss and disadvantages to downloading copyrights. Otherwise companies going to loss and we won't be able to download any thing from the internet.
