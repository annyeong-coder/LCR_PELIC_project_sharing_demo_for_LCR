I do a few things before I start to write. For example if my desk is very messy I clean the desk a little bit if it's not too messy that's fine. Then I cut up some fruits apples grapes or bananas . I bring them to my desk. After that I turn on the light. I like bright but my light is not bright and not dark. That's fine no problem for me. But bright is good for eyes. I like a quiet environment for study but I think listening to music and study is a good idea. I want to try that. Maybe it is good for me to study. Then I think about some examples and eat fruits. After I think about that I start writing. Sometimes I change my opinions about a subject or topic. Later I finish my writing. After that I eat fruits and relax.
