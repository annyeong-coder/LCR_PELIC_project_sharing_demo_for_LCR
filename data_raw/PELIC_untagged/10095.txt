They developed a kind of survey NEO PI R and used it for their experiment. First they began with two groups of NEO PI R surveys. In this survey they made volunteers rate their own personalities and the personalities of other individuals they know. Then they did a third survey that asked the volunteers to describe a typical person from their culture. By averaging these results they were able to have a third personality profile for each country reflecting the national stereotype.
