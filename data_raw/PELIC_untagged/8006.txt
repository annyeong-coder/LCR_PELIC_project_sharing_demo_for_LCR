A place I will never forget I had never seen so great swimming gymnasium in my youth. I loved to swim and I had spent most of free time in it during my stay in Beijing no matter hot summing or cold winter. Yingdong swimming gymnasium is a wonderful place for recreation and exercising. I will never forget how deep impression it is in the first time when I went to Yingdong swimming gynasium.
