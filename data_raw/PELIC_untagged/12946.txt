In most american tobacco commercials the american lifestyle is described. In some countries for young people smoking an american cigarette wearing jeans and drinking beer means living an american lifestyle. Many people would want to live in US and those who can not visit the US they at least try to pretend by smoking their tobacco and acting like them. These are all the effective result of tobacco ads.
