My ultimate goal is to become a rational scientist in the research institute and will investigate crucial questions regarding neurobiological mechanisms of emotional brain circuits. After obtaining my Ph. D. I will be extracting DNA RNA Protein examining neuron formations measuring and moving solutions milliliter by milliliter with pipettes in a prestigious laboratory all day like a busy cook in the kitchens of famous restaurants in New York. I will keep my head down over each tray of plastic tubes and tell them My most successful experiment will depend on you. Soon or later I will receive well rounded training by an interdisciplinary approach in the field of neuropathogenesis of ambiguous mental illness and then bring a Nobel Prize back to my hometown.
