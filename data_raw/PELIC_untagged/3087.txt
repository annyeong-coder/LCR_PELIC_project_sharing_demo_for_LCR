Architecture is the most believable indicator of cultural differences. From ancient times people have been building things. We need a place to live work study and entertain. So we built houses factories offices sports stadiums etc. These structures were built to fulfill our needs. Meanwhile some buildings that have the same purpose were built with structural differences. For example most of cultures have houses. But the external form of the house is determined by the culture. We recognize this fact easily by comparing a typical Korean house and an American house. Generally speaking the cultural differences are caused by the environment. The environment is reflected in architecture. Imagine the situation when you visit a foreign country. You realize that you are in a foreign country by what you see. In my case when I visited Qatar most houses were made of sand. Because there is plenty of sand in the desert they use sand to build houses. As you know in the Middle East they are surrounded by lots of desert. Accordingly we can assume the culture by seeing the structure. As a result architecture is the mirror of the cultural basis and the environment.
