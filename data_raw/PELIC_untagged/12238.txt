What I'm willing to say is one of the funniest situations about Koreans who mistake because of lack of English communication skills and prior information of American society system as they just arrive in USA. This story is really funny for me and I emphasized with this Korean because I am also Korean which is why I am telling about this story. There are typical mistakes about Can I help you for Koreans. I have heard plenty of mistaking stories about confusing like Can I help you because of embarrassment or nervousness. It might sound ridiculous but also I am sometimes confused between Can I help you and Can you help me I introduce one of them here. One Korean woman whose name is Mrs. ANON_NAME_0 got lost while she was driving in Oklahoma. She got nervous but she was lucky that there was a police car around the corner. She approached the policeman with a big smile and said Can I help you please The policeman looked confused so she kept insisting to say Please can I help you Please. What she actually intended to say is if he could help her. However the policeman answered with a big smile and said to her No thank you though. She got bad look to the policeman with a thought like that he is a bad policeman and is discriminating her because she is an Asian. The policeman probably thought she was either crazy or trying to deceive him or flirt. Therefore I understand why people say the policemen are bad in USA. I am not native speakers in English so there should be mistakes to communicate in English but the mistake is not only that I am not good at English but also it includes cultural misunderstanding. Consequently it is important that Keeping trying to overcome the cultural gap and never give up achieving it.
