I love Brasil every summer I would go to Rio de Janeiro with my family. It's frequently said that God is brazilian the real truth is unKnown but at tiny piece of him is in the Rio de Janeiro statue Christ the Redeemer Cristo Redentor This figure has been one of the most famous symbols of Rio. The statue satnds 32 m tall weighs 1000 Tn and is located a the peak of the 710m Corcovado mountain and you can see a magnificent panorama of the city. Christ the Redeemer opens his arms to all of Rio it is visble night and day from most of the city neighborhoods. I could not figure out how the people had raised the heavy statue and put it in the peak of the mountain. I asked a brazilian's boys about Christ the Redeemer's history. The brazilian's boys was a descendent of one the engineers who worked in the proyect. He told me a group of engineers and thechnicians must have worked hard and cooperated with one another. The Corcovado Rack Railway proved essential to the building effort as it was the only way to get the large pieces of the statue to the top of the mountain.
