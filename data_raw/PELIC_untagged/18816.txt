After I finished this semester in ELI I learned a plenty of English as well as international culture. I found it was very interesting to compare the different culture among countries. Before I came the U. S I had already learned about multicultural environment. However I did not perceive it so clearly until I started my English study in ELI. The ELI students came from different countries such as Libya Mongolia Turkey Korea Iran Sandi Arabia and Japan. Although we cannot use English to describe ourselves very well we try to introduce our countries' food clothes regions and culture in English. Not only was it a good idea to practice our speaking but we also learned other countries' culture. Our ELI teachers were fabulous. Almost all of them had overseas study experiences. Therefore They understood our situation very well. They organized an ELI Night party in the end of the semester. In this party everyone needed to prepare at least one dish which represented his or her country 's food. Everyone was enthusiastic about this party. One of our students had a traditional dance. Some of our teachers did impromptu speech in other languages. It was an opportunity for us to share our culture and make international friends. All in all I believe that learning different culture is the important thing I learned from ELI in this semester.
