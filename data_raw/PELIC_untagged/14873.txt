Hi everyone. I am writing this note to introduce myself to you my classmates in ELI 4P Grammar. I am Jing Last Name come from China. My name is very common in China since it is very easy to remember. I am studying grammar now for improving my English ability. Practicing is a good way for improving oral English thus I am trying to find a job in the University for speaking English more frequently. I am a graduate student in Information Science and I plan to achieve my master degree in 2 years. Therefore I am learning some other classes of my graduate program except ELI class. I have many hobbies such as travelling playing tennis and watching movies. Besides I like making friends especially some people from different countries. I hope we can become friends and help each other to improve our English.
