Tom Higgins opened a new restaurant at Benson University. Though he did all the renovations he needed his restaurant is doing poorly because he made mistakes concerning his restaurant's food and employees. First he made several mistakes in his restaurant's food. The food's concept of his restaurant is unclear. There are many varieties of food in his restaurant like Chinese Japanese Indian and Italian. They sometimes make customer confused about the food's concept of his restaurant and what they should order. Some of the foods and beverages of his restaurant are slightly expensive like Lamb curry's price is 14. 95 Dollars. He opened his restaurant in the university. That means most of his customers are students. He should think about serving the valuable food. Second he made several mistakes in hiring the employees. He should have hired a professional cook because food is one of the best features of a restaurant. He hired many people so he had to pay much money to employees. He should not have overpaid the worker to make them work hard.
