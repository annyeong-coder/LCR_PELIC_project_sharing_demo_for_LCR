When you open the door of my room first thing you see is the bet in front of you. Over the bed you can see the small table behind the wall. To the left there is a desk for studying. Next to it There is a closet. I hang my coats in it. Beside a closet There is a box for wasing clothes and many clothes are in it. On the right side wall you can see the big window. As catching the sun very well it is always hot in my room. In the back side there is a small closet and big TV is on it. There no space in left.
