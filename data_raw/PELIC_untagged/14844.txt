That was happened 2 years ago. While I was driving a car the car that was running in the front of mine suddenly stopped. Since I didn't expected I was so surprised about it. I tried to stop my car. And I stopped the car soon. Also the car just after mine was surprised at my suddenly stopping. But miraculously anybody wasn't heart by the accident. But that accident made me being stressed to drive a car.
