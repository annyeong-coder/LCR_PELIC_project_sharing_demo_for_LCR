In 2004 I deserved to go to the university which is the 4th biggest in Turkey according to the University exam. Before I started my major I was given a English preperation class. Instead I went to go to preperation I prefered working at the public. If I had studied hard my english level would have been different level so that If I hadn t gone to work I would be working at a construction company. Also If I knew English I had a chance to take good job as soon as I graduated from university. I wish I had learned English at that time. Today I am in the U. S. A to learn English I hope I will learn English here in a short time and I will turn back my country.
