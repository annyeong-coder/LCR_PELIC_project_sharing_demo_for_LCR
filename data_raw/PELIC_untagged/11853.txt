My favorite place to have lunch in Pittsburgh is the food space near Cathedral Cafeteria. I often bring my lunch and eat it there. I like this space because my friends sometimes come and talk to me. This space is inside so I should not worry about the weather. But the best thing is I can get extra food or drink easily if I am still hungry after lunch.
