Graduate from high school with high score I have been successful at more than one thing in my life. One of them was when I graduated from high school with high greed. Of course I had something that helped me to be successful in my study. First of all I used to study the most of my time. Sometimes I was studying with my friend but the most of my time alone. I was very enthusiastic to receive an excellent greed. My father was promising me he was saying if you receive an excellent greed I will give you a big prize . Second my father was advising me about the future life and what I'm going to be. Last thing helped me was one of my teachers. He always was encouraging me and he was helping me when I had any problem at school or at home. These are almost the important things helped me to be successful.
