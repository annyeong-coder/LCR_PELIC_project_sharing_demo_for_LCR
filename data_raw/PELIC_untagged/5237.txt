This is some advice I can give it to a new student in ELI to help them in the future. The most important thing you have to feel free and not be afraid of asking questions. Second do your homework very well and don't copy it from your partner. Third study what you are learning daily to take a good score. Also don't miss your classes or come late because if you do you will miss some information that could be very important. I hope this advice will help a new student to do well.
