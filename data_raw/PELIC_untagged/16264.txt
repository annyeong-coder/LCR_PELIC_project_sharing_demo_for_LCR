ANON_NAME_0 Last Name Writing 4Q 05 19 2009 Benefits of having a job that requires a lot of travel A traveling is a big aspect of discovering the new world . That's why a lots of people love to travel. My father used to take me for several days of trip when I was little girl. As a tourist guide he knows a lot about history culture interesting stories related with specific places. One thing always admired me was his wonderful speech ability. For my little mind he was a dictionary of the world. He used to say that ''Read about something is like giving you initial ideas but if you see it on your own eyes that will give you real knowledge also can say a chance to build your obvious opinion or view''. After all these years I realized that the life is all about acquiring from discovery and gaining more experience and I always envy for people who has a job requires a lot of travel without even spend a money from your own pocket. Maybe that's why life is so wonderful.
