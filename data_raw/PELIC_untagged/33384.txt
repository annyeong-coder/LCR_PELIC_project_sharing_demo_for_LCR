I had an interesting experience when I was studying English in Australia in 2002. I had never questioned that Chinese students need to wear the red scarf when they study in primary schools. I had been wearing the red scarf during the time I was a primary school student. It was proud for me as a student to wear it because you could only wear it if you were a good student. My Australian landlord's 14 years old daughter asked me whether I had another choice. I had never been asked this type of questions before I came to Australia. I tried to explain that the red scarf represented the half of our national flag which was reminding us the soldiers' dead for our country's revolution. But the girl asked what if a student wore a green skirt. Even though I gave her a satisfied answer I started to realize the different perspectives between us. I had always believed that it was the only one way to think about things but had never questioned about it. For example there was only one correct answer for each question. In the school I had never thought creatively but memorized the answers from books. As soon as I had started taking courses in my college in Australia I started to enjoy criticizing others' opinions. Because of my overseas study experiences I had learned how to think creatively.
