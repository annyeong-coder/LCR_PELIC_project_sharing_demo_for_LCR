Last night Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia granted his first broad based television interview to Lesley Stahl on CBS's 60 Minutes. There he explained that the torture of detainees does not violate the 8th Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment because according to Scalia torture is not used as punishment. Def to disobey or do something against a law rule agreement etc.
