My house in U. S. Is so beautiful and comfortable but there are several thing to figure out in my view. My room is so beautiful but I still need to hang up some picture and straighten the bed up. Another thing is the basement I need to touch up the wall and throw some old stuff away. Then I can hang up some picture there. For my kitchen I bought a new dinner table and I discover I didn't like so probable I am going to take it back to the store. There are a lot of working to do in my beautiful and comfortable house.
