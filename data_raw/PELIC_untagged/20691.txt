The decoration of my homestay room is pretty cute and elegant. It always cheers me up whenever I am brought down by homework or test in school. I really love my room so I often straighten up my room to make it neat. However I still want to touch up my rooms to make it more perfect. For example the corner near my desk is a little bit dark even I turn on the lamp so I would like to pick up a bright table lamp to light up my desk. Sometimes I still feel cold even though the central heating is turned on so I would like to pick out a heating and put it away to keep me warm. Besides I want to do my room up and I want to hang up some beautiful paintings on the wall. The room will be my dream room if I can follow through all of the works.
