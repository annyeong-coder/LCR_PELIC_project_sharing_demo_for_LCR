Crime is a serious problem in many big American cities. Homicides cause the deaths of more children in Washington D. C. Than any other single type of injury including car accidents house fires or drowning. Types of violent crime range from arson and burglary to assault rape and murder. The solution to this growing problem is not to build more and bigger prisons and police station but rather to provide more jobs for people. Crime rate is usually higher in some area where poor people live in. A lot of people there don't have jobs. Even if they have jobs their salary is very low. They don't have enough money to buy food to see doctor and to let their children go to school. They need more money to live. Money is a cause of almost all of the crime. These crimes are usually senseless violent crime. If government can provide more jobs people could make more money. What's more the government can have more tax income. Of course the government can take more money for improving people's condition. Their life could be better than before. As a result they don't need to make crime for money. This is the best way to reduce crime rate.
