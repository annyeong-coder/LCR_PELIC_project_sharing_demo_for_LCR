I think. Each country has different temperature. So they have different species of animal tree plant and vegetable. Then Food from each country is different. But if you want to eat healthy food. You don't worry about species of animal tree plant and vegetable. Then you must to increase vegetable and bean into your food and decrease meat and oil. So I think. It is not varies from culture to culture.
