I tripped over my cat and got cut from the edge of stairway. Even I couldn't find my wallet which I always put it on the table. Shortly after I realized my house had been stolen by burglars. All drawers and windows were opened and they stole my laptop TV and even my cell phone. Also it seemed like they ate my birthday cake. So I called 911 and reported the case. Fortunately my friend just came in at that moment and he could take care of it. Thus I could go to the work. On my way to work I decided to take a shortcut through an old part of town. I had lived this town for 20 years but I had never used this shortcut before. I just assumed it would save my time to go to work. However reached half way through I stuck on the road because of construction. I had to turn back all the way through and use Main Street which had terrible traffic jam. What is worse I got caught by speeding and not carrying a driver's license. Anyhow I managed to get to my work. When I arrived at work I found a note on my desk from my boss. She wanted to see me right away. I took a deep breath and walked into her office. As I stepped inside I noticed a scowl on her face. I examined her face carefully thinking what could be a problem and I recalled yesterday. Even before I made an excuse small note with two word airport and pickup hit my head because I was supposed to pick up our new branch manager from Korea. I completely forgot! It couldn't have been worse!
