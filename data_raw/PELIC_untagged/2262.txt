My Writing Habits When I write something I need some tools and good place. For instance frist if I write letter I need a lot of paper because I often have mistakes like wrong information or ecessary words. So if I do that I usually don t erase the words I just change the paper. And also if I study something I usually use the eraser. Because it s very fast. During the study time is very important. I have to fast if I m possibility. Second I want to study at bright place and I also want enough that as much as teacher s desk in my classroom area. For example Iin the dark place or room I can t see that I want. It makes that my feeling is not good. When I start the study my desk is usually very clean. But at the finish time my desk is very messy. So my best study place is a classroom many desks in the room give me enough place to work. A fluorescent light in the room helps me too. Therefore I always try to make this place and search like this.
