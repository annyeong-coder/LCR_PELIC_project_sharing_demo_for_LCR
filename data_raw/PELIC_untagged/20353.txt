I can remember vivdly when I was a kid studying at primary school at that time our teacher was the trigger to strat my creativity. He was giving me candy every time I got grad A. My creativity was ihfluenced by another important factor which is competition when I was studying in the secondery school. I was competing with two other intelegent students. Our teacher was not biased to any of us. At the end of the year and after a long way competion I won and the school gave me a prise in the form of radio. It was really a stimulous for me and a concrete step to begin my career. Subsequently My parents acknoleged me to chose Medicine to be my ultimate disteny. I was not relactant to start my graduate study at one of the most reputant medical schools in Libya. The competition was high in the collage of medicine. However I did not give up and I gave it my maximum efforts which evetulayy and luckely ended up with a scholership to complete my medical post graduate study in the USA. I can not belive my eyes especially when I see such a wounderful reading teacher called Rabika being my teacher for this semester. I must me lucky!!!
