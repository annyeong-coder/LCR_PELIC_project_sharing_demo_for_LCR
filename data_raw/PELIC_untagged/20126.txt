It is good to know ourselves and our personalities. I'm a very emotional person who is easily affected with emotions. Sometimes I have strong emotions that lead me. Some days I have one emotion or mood which dominates all the day from morning to evening but more often my mood can change easy. For example I remember the case where I had an idea and I was all enthusiastic about something. I needed an advice which can help me in that situation. I went to David who is my friend and with whom we studied at the University. His response was We'll see. And nothing definite. I hate same words which make me so angry. I just wanted to hit him. I responded You who is my friend could give me a better advice! Can't you ever get excited about anything But later I understood that her had his opinion which was more logical than emotional.
