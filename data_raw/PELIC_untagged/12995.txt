Before I went to U. S I was trainee at Saudi Aramco Company. I left that company because I got scholar ship from the ministry of high education to study Mechanical engineering in any country in the world. I choosed U. S because I used to live there with my family. However I was studing english languge in ELS until I finished the advanced level. After that I wanted to study my major in Pitt university. Now I'm in ELI which in Pitt untill next term.
