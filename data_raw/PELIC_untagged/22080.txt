Yes I believe that it is different between human' and nonhuman primates' language. After reading Chapter 2 and watching the video I think both human and nonhuman primates can express their feelings by gesture position and facial expression but only human can use oral language to talk and communicate directly and nonhuman primates only can make a sound. The language which nonhuman primates use is more rudimentary for instance even KoKo a trained gorilla only can use simple sign language to communicate with people but not other gorilla Michael.
