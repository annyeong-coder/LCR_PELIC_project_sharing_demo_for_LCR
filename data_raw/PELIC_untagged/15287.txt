I think that Pittsburgh has the most number of bridges in the United States. Before I came to Pittsburgh I lived in a Siberian city built on a big river. But my city does not have so many bridges. In Pittsburgh I was really impressed by huge number of bridges their shapes and architectural details. You can see many wonderful bridges from the top of the Mount Washington or when you take a walk along the river. The good idea for new arrivals would be to take a river tour to introduce them to the city and the bridges. Pittsburgh bridges make the city unique and give it much character and charm.
