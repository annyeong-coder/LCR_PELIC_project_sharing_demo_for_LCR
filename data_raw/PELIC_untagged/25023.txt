ANON_NAME_0 Rubianogroot was my colleague at the Santo Tomas University. We met a long time ago. She was working at the University of Rosario. I remember that I attended a meeting about Colombian philosophy and she was participating in this academic event that this university organized. She is always interested in topics about the Latin American continent. Her areas of study are very complex. Years ago she was working about Bartolome de las Casas. He was a famous Dominician who was fighting for the abolition of slavery. Also I remember that she was reading for a long time chronicles about the new world. We usually met in some coffee shop to share our reading and academic projects. Months ago she read an article about Heraclitus that I was writing for a long time. Her suggestions were very valuable. I sent this article to the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico. A few days ago they sent me an e mail in which they approved it for publish in Noua Tellus this is the journal of the Instituto de Investigaciones Filologicas. When I received the news I was walking at Highland Park. I was very excited with the news then I sent an e mail to ANON_NAME_0 to thank her. She felt very happy with the news.
