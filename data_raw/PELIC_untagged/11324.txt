Friends are very important for everyone. All people have some kind of friends some are fake friends and some are real friends. I am sure that having a real friend is better you might not have the same interests but you can still be best friends. For example Richie who is my friend enjoys playing football but I like to play soccer more. That is one of the things that is different between me and Richie. Also Richie who meets with me every day has a different opinion about the war in Iraq. He does not agree with his sister either whose opinion is the same as mine. Even Richie has different looks at life with comparing his parents who are living with him. In addition Richie can be friends with a strange who he didn't even know few minutes ago. If someone asked if friends have to be alike the answer is no because Richie is totally not like me. I think everyone can friends who are not alike each other. Richie is a kind of friend who never ditches you. That is one of the reasons why Richie is my best friend.
