According to my experience I had studied with many teachers in high school and also during my Academic life in university. I felt happy in most of my classes because I adapted to my teachers' strategies. Frankly I found out that each teacher had special method to teach as well dealing to the students. The method was diverse from each teacher. Every teacher counted on his method. The information will be discussed below. One of my great teachers his name was Hasan. He used to teach me math in high school. He had a nice way to teach which is letting the students to interrupt him once they did not understand lesson or the point. On the other hand my chemistry teacher was strict and he did not let anyone interrupt him when he taught the daily lesson. He did not have rational reason for that. He is little bit ambiguous. He was not as kind as our math teacher. Crucial point was enhancement of the level of the students. Math teacher provided feedback to us every day but our chemistry teacher did not provide this helping for us. They were completely different from each other. Our math teacher triggered students to participate in the class while chemistry teacher used to make the class boring and did not encourage the students. Eventually they absolute their methods are helpful for the students and the right track.
