The dilenmma that I have faced is I should prepare for going into graduate school or not. When I came to Pittsburgh my husband was supposed to stay here for just one year but the longer he stayed in Pittsburgh the less he wants to go back and work in Japan. In the first year I enjoyed my life in Pittsburgh which was as if I'd had a long vacation. However in my second year of Pittsburgh I've felt like starting something new to have my life stepped up because it's not satisfied to being just a housewife here in Pittsburgh. I want to join the program in Grad to take masters degree but my husband is not sure how long we will stay more so I haven't done anythig since I started to think about going into Grad. So recently I think that I should've studied to take TOEFL without any worry about my husband. If I started to prepare for Grad last year I might have been a grad student now. I could've been having a hard time but I could've been satisfied the days in Pittsburgh. I often look back on and think that I shouldn't have missed the chance to go to Grad. I enjoyed my first year of Pittsburgh spending time with Japanese friends but I should've studied hard as soon as I came here. I'm still thinking what I should do.
