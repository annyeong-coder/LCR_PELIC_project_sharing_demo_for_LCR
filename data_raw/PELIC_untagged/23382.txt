The concept of happiness is different from one to another. Some people think happiness comes from money power and fame. But can these really make one happy From my perspective happiness comes from love health and contentment. Love your family friends and your life. If you feel love your outlook will change to a positive one Treat people around you with love Show them that you love them. As a result of this all of them will change and become very gentle with you. If you love your work you will advance which make you happy. Good health is a crown on the heads of the healthy that only the ill can see. This is an Arabic proverb which indicates the importance of health. Because of being well and free of diseases you will be happy. Since you can exercise every day practice your hobbies and do what ever you want to do. Do not forget that you will feel joyful as a result of eating some food that brings happiness. Contentment is the basis of happiness. It makes you satisfied with yourself. In addition it does not restrict your ambitious. Contentment removes hatred of other people's success. Let's take advantage form this story. There were two friends Joe and Adam went fishing. Adam caught a big fish and put it in his bag to go back home. Joe asked why do you want to go now Adam said that he had caught a large fish which was enough for him and his family for dinner. Joe said wait to catch many of them . Why I do that Adam asked. Joe replied that you could sell them and earn much money. Why asked Adam. Joe said that you would become rich and if you became rich you could enjoy with your children and your life. That's exactly what I'm going to do I don't want to postpone until life is gone Adam replied. In conclusion I advise you to love life and do not waste time without glad moment. Try to take care of your health and be satisfied with yourself. Those are the keys of happiness.
