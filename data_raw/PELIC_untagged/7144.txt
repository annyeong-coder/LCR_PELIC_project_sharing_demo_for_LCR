I have a lot of good friend. My best friend who writes scenario at a broadcasting station is completely different from me. She likes to cook but I don't like to cook. We are not same the hobby interest. Also she is beautiful and smart. People like her who always is kind to other people. My friend has a dog whose name is haetaly. Her dog likes everyone except me. So I don't like the dog. But my friend who lived in countryside likes every animal. Even though my friend and I don't have a point of sameness we like each other.
