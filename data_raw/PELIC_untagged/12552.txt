When are you coming to US . First of all you should have a visa and your passport still valid. I think you shouldn't pack too many clothes because is summer. You have to make a hotel reservation in advance. Maybe you should bring sun creme to protect your skin. You'd better not carry cash. You ought to bring camera to take a lot of pictures.
