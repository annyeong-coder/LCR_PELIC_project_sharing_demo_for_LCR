Feng shui has caught on with modern architects and homeowners everywhere. I try figure out which things into a living room make me bad energy . I worked out the problem and touch up by change the color of walls pastels. Today colors of sand and soil catch on at my home. I picked out dark and big furniture that cover up very big living room. When I am alone I like turn on classic music and flying with my thoughts. My living room make me feel good.
