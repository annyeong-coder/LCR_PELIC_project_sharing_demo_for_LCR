One of the most significant problems is crime in a society. Almost everyday we can come across different crime news on TV and in newspapers. Big amount of these events are caused by non educated people. In my opinion the increasing of crime events can be prevented by educating some non educated people through social events. The big role belongs to social foundations that are responsible to organize open public events. For instance once a year this kind of foundations can organize some seminars to inform people about how crime affects our life negatively during the last decades. This period should be long and should be feed by some entertaining programs. In order to make this kind of programs efficient people should be served food to make the programs attractive. A person who carries potential to crime can be affected by this approach and transformed into good and productive citizen. Briefly the solution of minimizing crime problems depends on social activities and programs. People who are in that situation are generally non educated part of the citizen and they can be meliorated by educable and also attractive organizations.
