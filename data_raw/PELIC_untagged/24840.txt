When I was at university I had many humorous stories that I experienced but what makes me a lot was Taksim tragedy which I called. Taksim which is a popular place to have fun has approximately 700 pubs night club s so that it is always crowded. Beside this life never stops there. I and some friends of mine would went there to have fun when we were at university. One night we drank alcohol a lot as a result we became drunk. After leaving pub we started walking on the street. Suddenly We found ourselves dancing on the street. I don t know how it started. When we were dancing normally we were 5 people but suddenly we became 10 people. We hadn t know who they were. What the interesting was no one stopped dancing even we hugged these people because everyone was super drunk. I am not sure I think two hours later I came to myself as lying on the ground and I got up my friends. Unfortunately that guys were robber they stole our all money so that we had to get back by foot.
