My weekend My weekend was special day that I had a happy party with my friends. We Shown ANON_NAME_0 ANON_NAME_1 and me made a promise that we had a party on Saturday night. We were very excited. First I met ANON_NAME_0 at 10 00 a. M. On Saturday. Because we was going to Carnegie science center with ELI classmate for activity. But there were not enough people who want to go there. We are only six. We had a enjoyable day in there. And then ANON_NAME_0 and I went to Shown's house at 5 00. He showed us into a house. We didn't prepare for party. So We divided work and share money. ANON_NAME_0 and I went to buy some beer. Shown and his roommate went to buy some food. We took pleasure in party until we finished our party. We were a strong drinker except Shown. I sometimes couldn't give an English dialog with Taiwanese. But I was no matter of me. Now We are reminding of good memory.
