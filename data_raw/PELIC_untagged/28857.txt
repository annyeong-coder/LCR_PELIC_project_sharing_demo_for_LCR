Effects of war There are different issues in the world that affect us in various ways. One of them is war which happens as a result of the conflicts between two countries affects our society. The three major effects of war are depression pollution and destruction. First one major effect of war is depression which makes it terrible and it causes lots of anxiety. Most of the people who fight in a war are young men who leave their families to defend their nation. This puts their families under a lot of stress and pressure. Therefore children parents and wives probably experience the most difficult time of their lives. They become worried about the future and what would happen to their loved ones during the war. Second another major effect of war is pollution which makes it dreadful. As you know armies utilize chemical bombs in some wars. For instance in the Iraq Iran war the Iraqi soldiers used chemical bombs which destroyed the ecosystem of some regions. It polluted the water therefore people did not have pure and clean water to drink. It also caused lung disease and cancer which could not be cured. Many people became blind and were unable to see again. Finally the last major effect of war is destruction which makes wars so ugly. In wars the countries do not just fight in battlefields but they attack the cities as well therefore many buildings and houses will be destroyed. This would cause a number of economical problems for the countries because it would cost a lot to rebuild them. To sum up three major effects of war which make it terrible are depression pollution and destruction. I hope that no country starts a war and everybody lives in peace and tranquility
