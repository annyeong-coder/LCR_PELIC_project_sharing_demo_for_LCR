New Market District Supermarket which includes the largest food store in Western Pennsylvania is the jewel in Giant Eagle's crown of 220 supermarkets. The grand opening celebrations is starting tomorrow in the new Settlers Ridge shopping center in Robinson. Savvy architects or possibly frustrated shoppers designed the store with many points of entry. That means Shoppers can enter the area in which they choose to shop. Another good news is there are 31 cash registers. At the centerpiece there are tons of domestic specialty and locally grown fruits and vegetables and most of them are organic. Aisles are short and signage is large so shoppers can see front to back with no long walks. There is a place to find ready to eat food as well. We can call it a food court on steroids or destination dining. But Market District calls it The Cafe. These cafes are the what you are coming to see. Smoke and Fire Slow Roasting Rotisserie Rosti Bar Crepe Bar Pizza Bar DIY Bars Asian Street Food Bar Sushi Bar. The Cafe also has a sandwich counter a bakery and a gelato station. And you'll still be able to walk or waddle around the rest of the store after you graze snack and eat. There is an olive oil station does not have mere single bottles for sampling. The Italian urns known as fustis hold extra virgin olive oil from Italy Spain Tunisia Australia and Chile. Other fustis hold a variety of vinegars. A tasting bar with bread and cheese allows you to sample. Laura Shapira Karet Giant Eagle's senior executive vice president and chief strategy officer said from the store yesterday that picking her favorite part would be like naming a favorite part of a baby and this store did not just appeal to foodies but anyone who loves good food whether it's exotic seafood or the best ham sandwich.
