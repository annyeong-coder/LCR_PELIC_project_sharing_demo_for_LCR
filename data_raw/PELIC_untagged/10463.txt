My weekend is very enjoyable this week. First I woke up early on Saturday I took my breakfast and I went to the museum with my wife and my kids. We spent a lot of time there. We saw many things from the past history the dinosaurs situates and kinds of clothes then. On Sunday morning I went to shopping to get some things for my house I buy vegetables milk meat and other things we need. I hate shopping but I have to do that. In the evening I went back to my home very tired I slept about two hours. In the night I did my home work and I read to late. Always I have to do many things in a weekend.
