He must be enthusiastic about his job which may be a sale. He could live near his company so he could be walking to his company. He might be an American young man who may be twenty early years old. He must manage his time very well so he could both be a student and a worker. He might have made an appointment with his customer this morning. He must not have had available time to eat breakfast because he is too thin. He may not have remembered playing with his brother in the backyard. He might be thinking of making a lot of bucks to travel throughout the world.
