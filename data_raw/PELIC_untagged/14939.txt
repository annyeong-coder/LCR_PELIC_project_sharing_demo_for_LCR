I was born in Jazan where my family live. I have moved to many places due to my father work. When I was three months old we moved to Riyadh where my father was working. Six years later we came back to Jazan and I grew up there. I have visited many cities in my country and adjacent countries. I visited Abha with my family and friends every summer. I have many friends from different cities and I visit them when I have time. My childhood dream was to be an English teacher. I was interested in soccer but now not as previous. I have a lot of pictures of my childhood and my friends. Last summer I visited Doha and I stayed there one night before I came to United States.
