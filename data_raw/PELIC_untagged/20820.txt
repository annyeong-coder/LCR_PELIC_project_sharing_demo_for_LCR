The National School Lunch Program NSLP is a federally assisted meal program operating by congress because of foods such as packaged reheatable menus. NSLP prevented child in the school to be nourished and required the government to purchase extra foods in order to control lunch program. According to cooperation between school districts and private companies 9000 schools have connected a national farm to school program to increase healthier menus. However even though these attempt it can't easily change their lunch menus widely. In my opinion I believe it will get better and better.
