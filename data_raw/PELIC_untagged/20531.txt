What Are Behind Illiteracy Illiteracy has been a worldwide problem since human created characters. With the progress of society illiteracy rate reveals itself as a declining trend over the past thousands years. However the more advanced the world develops the more illiteracy stands out in modern life. It is hard to imagine a person who lives a life without recognizing texts in a metropolis. It sounds like a patient with dyslexia. What cause illiteracy in modern society In my opinion illiteracy is not only the reflection of education but also the mirror of many underlying issues in our society such as economy politics etc. Poverty is the primary cause of illiteracy. As an antique Chinese proverb says depositories first then etiquettes. This means that we wouldn't know courtesies until we could afford basic subsistence. Due to the lack of money the poors can't go to school or the poor countries don't have enough money to build adequate schools to accommodate all students. Consequently the poors fail to read and write. This leads to illiteracy. According to the statistics by United Nations literacy rate is diverse from country to country and parallels with economy the poorer the country the more illiteracy. Illiteracy rate in developing countries is higher than that in developed ones. On this point economy accounts for illiteracy. The Chinese proverb in the second paragraph was translated into English by me I hope I didn't distort the oringinal meaning.
