My younger brother is taller than my older brother. He has more hair and fewer moles in his face. He is darker than him. He is funny as much as the older one. He isn't as quietly as him. He is more accurate and more hard working. My older brother is as kind as my younger brother. He isn't as spendthrift as him. He is more patiently and more carefully.
