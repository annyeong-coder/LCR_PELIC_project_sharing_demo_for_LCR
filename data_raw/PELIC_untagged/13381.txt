Hello my name is Student's Name . The ELI people call me Evie. Because pronounce of my origin name is too difficult for foreign friends. I'm an undergraduate I study business in University. But now I'm studying English in Pittsburgh because most of Korea companies require the highest English skill and the IBT the Toeic. So I'm trying to improve my English skill. I enjoy watching movies and American TV shows the Gray's anatomy the heroes the 24. . . When I lived with my family I disliked cook. But now I'm living alone in Oakland this situation makes me enjoy cooking. Next year in the spring I'll go back my home. Then I'll graduate the University.
