My uncle Ozcan is one of the most famous person in my family. His life was filled up with interesting things. There are some reasons which make him different for me. At first glance even tough he looks a little fat he has an athletic body structure that is why he plays soccer every weekend and make a goal easily than other players. He is not tall due to that situation he acts agilely. He has dark and short hair and doesn't like a mustache or beard. First of all he is well educated person that is why everybody in the family wants to consult him before attempting to do something. He decided to go to England. In my high school life I always envied him and wanted to be like him as an engineer and fluent English speaker. He was educated about more than 2 years in England. And he experienced many things in England. Some of experienced passed on me which I utilize to act appropriately and effectively in the U. S. He is very helpful also. He helped me on the all steps of my life when I consult to him in order to make a good decision during my education life. If I am at this point I owe to him this accomplishment. Along with that he has many experiences which allow him to have reliable decisions to act precisely when he come across with different kind of issues. He also has a entrepreneurship character structure which helps him to decide and attempt to do investments. By the way even tough the economical crisis all over the world he is planning to invest and set up a new manufacturing plant in Turkey. In my opinion he feels ready to face with problems and produce different approaches to overcome them. And he likes to challenge and this behavior make me to attract to do something. He wants to make something just one time and wants to make the best one in order to change everything. I thing he needs change. And I always observe his life to get some experience to shape my actions.
