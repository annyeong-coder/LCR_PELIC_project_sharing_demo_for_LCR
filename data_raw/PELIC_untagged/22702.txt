Recently I saw Avatar directed by James Cameron at the movie theater. The movie which I saw with 3D glasses fascinated me with its huge scale and overwhelmingly beautiful graphics. James Cameron a legendary movie director in Hollywood has directed many great movies including Titanic the Terminator films. It is said that he has waited more than 10 years to realize the movie Avatar with high techniques. In the movie Jake Sully acted by Sam Worthington was a former marine. He using a wheelchair due to his broken legs had a chance to explore Pandora the planet to get some information. Because of the toxicity of atmosphere in Pandora Jake had to connect his consciousness to his avatar which is the same species as the Navi. Then he met a woman whose name was Neytiri the daughter of the chief of Navi and fell in love with her. He learned to become one of Navi which included hard trainings and adventures. Finally he respecting the way of life in Pandora helped them from a battle and become a real Navi.
