Hi I'm Adams. I built this website to advertise my resturant . I've been studying international food since 2006. I have traveled to Italy to learn Italian food. I cooked pasta lazania and spagitte. I have traveled to Morroco avd I have learned how to cook harira and kuskus. This year I have been studying mediterranean food . I have been in Lebanon and Syria. I've been trying to learn Asian food but I'm still not good enough. Last month I opened my new resturant in Downtown which serves international dishes.
