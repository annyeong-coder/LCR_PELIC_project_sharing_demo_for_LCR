Impact of earthquake Throughout history Erthquake is consedred to be one of the most agressive natural disasters thretening the man kind. Middle East magasine last year showed that death rate from an earthquake can reach up to 10 in undeloped countries. In addition it New Yourk magazine has concluded that earthquakes increases the risk of people immegration by 30 . Right now no one knows exactly why does earthquake happen But an Indian architect said It is most likely to be due to the increased pressure of the internal layers of the earth. Regadless the mechanism earthquake has direct impact on indivisual health status and country's economy. Earthquake can affect indivisuals health through many ways firestly they distroy the countery s infrastructures including the hospitals so no places where people will recieve the heath care and managment of emergency cases being injured during earth quake. Secondly multiplication of insects in that areas will contribute for disease transmission. Lastly malnutrition will result in decreased immunity of most of invisuals due to decreased food intake that is essential for bulding up the immune system. As earthquake can affect the countery from all aspects for example factories farms schools ect. In addition to human rsources so it will inversly affects the economy of that countery. And even if there is an opertunity to work most of people will think of protecting their selfs rather than working. Another important factor is that people immegration will has a negative impact on the the economy. As I mintion earthquak has many imacts on human and in order to decrese those effects I suggest to cooperate with those affected areas and to help them by all means.
