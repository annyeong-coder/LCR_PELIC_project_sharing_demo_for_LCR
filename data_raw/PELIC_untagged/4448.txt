My best teachers are my parents. They have been watching me grown up. So they know about me very well. As they are my parents they want me to be a good girl. So they always help me to do the right things. When I don't behave myself they get me to fix the problem. For an example when I don't do what I am supposed to do such as cleaning my room they make me finish cleaning my room. They also never let me do the things that could cause bad effects on me. Considering these reasons I have no doubt that they are the best teachers for me.
