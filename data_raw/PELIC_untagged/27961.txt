When I was chatting with a friend this morning online I got a news that a famous people who is one of my favorite actress in my country got married with a rich man today. What shocked me was that they have known each for only 20 days. The actress whose name is S had been single for several years. The fact why she had not gotten married at age 39 was she wanted to make her career more successful. The man who she married is also famous because his ex girlfriend is a famous singer. Some people said that the reason for S to get married with that man is money. I have no idea whether she loves him or not. But it is just a news. And I'm not really sure whether it is true or not. Of course If it is true I hope they can get together forever.
