Q5. The first example is in 1968 NY City Kitty Genovese was a New York City woman who was stabbed to death near her. The events of Genovese's death are subject to dispute. Certain accounts suggest that her cries for help were heard and ignored by numerous residents at the apartment. Genovese screamed was heard by 39 neighbours who turn off the light and open their window look out saw him tabbing her . In fact they scare him away and he left. They did not call the police all what they did they turn off the light and closed the window. Furthermore the man came back and did it again . Despite the fact that they are 39 witness saw her no one called the police. Second example is the reaction of a people when smoke comes in the room. Study tested bystander effect in case of some situations to see if they would influence by other people. The researcher ask two person who was included in his study to stay and do not move because they are part of his experimental study. When the some come in they looked at each other but they did not move. But if the person all by themselves talking the test and they supposed to be part of study when he she see some come in they get up and inform the people outside the room that they are some in. Third example is about one girl who was accidentally has offending bounder with somebody else. She hit car of 3 bigger men. She was scared these guys starting beating her only escape is to jump over the bride . 27 People watch and no body stopped them.
