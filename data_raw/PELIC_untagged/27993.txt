Argumentative essay Foreign language instruction should begin in kindergarten In today's world it is important to know at least one foreign language since in the last decades the communications between different countries have increased significantly. In today's education system in my country children are starting to learn a foreign language when they are going to 4th grade until the last one. However I think a foreign language instruction should begin in kindergarten to improve the children learning skills and raise the quality of studying of foreign language. Children in kindergarten are open to learning any new things. They can easily accept and understand new information because they see learning process as a game. They learn a language almost effortlessly. Learning languages helps to improve memory creativity thinking and listening ability that are needed learning skills in their feature. Foreign language instruction in kindergarten could include knowledge of elementary math nature and arts. It is the time in kindergarten when they actively learn their native language and are used to memorizing new words copying people's voice and pronunciation. It gives them an ability to form their pronunciation like native speakers when they grow up. They have a lot of time to practice speaking which leads to speaking foreign language more fluently in future.
