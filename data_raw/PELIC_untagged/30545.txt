In my perspective I think that living in lifestyle sometimes has a benefit. Such as living in the living a dream group. It is consist of people have the common thing that is prefer quit environment without any annoying people or DISTURBING things. They live their live with all positive emotions and CAREFREE. So if I have a chose to live in a lifestyle I will PARTICIPATE in the living dream group.
