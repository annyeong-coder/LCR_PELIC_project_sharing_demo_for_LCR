Since I was 18 years old in the high school I planned my future. Everything was going well as I thought. I finished high school with excellent grades. Then I wanted to study engineering at the best university in my country. I applied for study there. However they refused my requisition. After that I got a scholarship. My scholarship was in Germany and United States. I could never imagine myself study abroad. Then I started thinking which country I had to choose. If I had chose Germany I could be desiring waste my time for studying Germany. Also I if had not studied in Germany I could not be speaking English. If I had gone to Germany I could be meeting my best friend. After that I started to think about studying in US. . Then if I had not decided to study in the U. S I would be studying in Saudi Arabia. My family said to me if you had not gotten visa you would have not gone. When I got my visa my uncle talked to me about the system on the US because he lived there for long time. Also he gave me some advice for example if you want to speak English very well you should not be shy. Then when I came to Pittsburgh I started to study English in ELI. So I usually think about if I had not came to Pittsburgh I would be studying English there and writing this homework.
