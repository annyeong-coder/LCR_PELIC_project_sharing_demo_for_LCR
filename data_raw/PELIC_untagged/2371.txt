IndentWhen I was eight years old I got my first lesson in facing a mistake bravely and solving it. As a birthday gift a bike was my best present from my father. I had anticipated it for several months because most of my friends already had one and riding the bike made them very cool. I was jealous of my friends so much. So when my wish came true I pushed my new bike to the street immediately even though I hadn't learned how to ride it yet. I sat on the seat and my friends pushed my bike on the slope. I completely believed the slope could help me ride the bike quickly and I did. I felt wonderful about the speed and the wind. My friends applauded for me and I heard the acclaim from my friends. At that time I really forget who I was and forgot I wasn't able to ride the bike. Unfortunately an old man who was holding his walking stick crossed the street when I was so proud by myself. If I had known how to ride I could have stopped my car quickly or turned to the other way. However I didn't know that and my mind was blank. The bike hit the old man directly. When the old man saw me he didn't have a place to hide. We both fell down on the ground. Run away! Run away! That were the only words was coming my mind. I dragged my bike and fled the crash. I didn't recognize that he was my father's friend. When I went back home I hid this secret. Several days later my father met his friend who I had collided. My father had given me a chance tell him about the collision but I had missed. Finally my father let me realize my fault and make an apology to his friend. I should write a letter and I was forbidden to ride the bike for one month as a punishment I will never forget that. When I do something wrong I know honesty is the best policy.
