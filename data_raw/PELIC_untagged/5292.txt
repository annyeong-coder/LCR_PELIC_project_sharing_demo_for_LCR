There are several pointers that I would give a new ELI student who wants to succeed in learning English. First he should do all of his homework because homework helps you learn. Second you must go to every class because class helps you with pronunciation. Third you should try to make an American friend because he will help you with your speech. Finally you should always choose to study at a college that appeals to you because it is difficult to transfer schools.
