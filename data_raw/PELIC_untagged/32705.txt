My new appartment in the U. S has one bed room a kitchen and a living room. I picked up the furnitures and my frind helped me built them up. I like the paint however it needs to be touched up. There aren't enough light in the appartment so I am planning to gang up some bulbs. For the moment I am looking forward for some cooking supplies and cleaning staff. I like to change the places of the furnitures between a while and other so I think I will turn the couch around in the coming days. I also like to have some free space. Therefor I will throw away some Chairs which were here before I had moved.
