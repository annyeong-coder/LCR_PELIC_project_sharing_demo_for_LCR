Hi I am Fen. I am writing these paragraphs to introduce myself. Since I was in the elementary school I have loved reading. But we didn't have many books. Because of economy there were not as many books as today and there was no public library in my area. However I had been reading in a private small library every day after school by paying 2 cents for a book. It was a lot of fun! Two or three kids were reading one book together so We could discuss about a story and sometimes we laughed at the same time spontaneously when we read something funny. And I could remember things happened. When I was young me and peers had been playing outside every evening. We ran chased and yelled when it was drizzling in the summer. Sometimes we made kites by ourself to fly when the wind was strong. Maybe my childhood made me like being outside. Therefore I have been jogging almost every day since I was 20 years old.
