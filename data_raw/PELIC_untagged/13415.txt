Hi I'm Student's Name . I came to the U. S. From Korea on Aug. 30 This year. I've been living with my sister's family in Allison Park near Pittsburgh for a month. I've been studying in the ELI of the University of Pittsburgh since Sep. 2. Before I came here I didn't know the details of the ELI. I've already taken several tests in each class this month. Furthermore I've been suffering from too much homework. My house is far from the school and I have no car. At the second day of the ELI I went to the school by bus for the first time. It took over one and a half hours from my house to the school. Since then I've been carpooling with my neighbor who is also an ELI student. Although the ELI has provided many activities to the students so far I haven't participated in the activities. So I have considered moving near the school.
