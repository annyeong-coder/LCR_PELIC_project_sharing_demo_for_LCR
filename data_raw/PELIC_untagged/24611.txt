To go to the island I may take a box of matches because it may be cold in the island so I can use matches to get warm. Also I could take a flashlight. If I don't take it I might drop into a hole at night. Flashlight can helps me to find the direction at night. The last thing I must take is a knife. For safety a knife can be a tool to protect myself when I'm in trouble. For food I may use a knife to kill some little animals to eat.
