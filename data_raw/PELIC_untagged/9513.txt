My friends always ask me Will you return to Taiwan The answer is Yes I'll. When I finish this summer semester in Pitt I am going to return my country. After my husband will finish his research study in this October we are going to go back Taiwan. My kids are going to learn more Chinese language. I also will do my research study after I go back my country. I won't stop learning English in the future. I am going to study English in Taiwan. When will I come back US I am going to visit here every year. While I miss my friends and teachers in Pittsburgh I'll send email to them.
