Title Taken The genre of this movie is thriller and action which is the most interesting genre. The reason why I like this kind of movie is that it makes me tense all through screening. The synopsis of Taken is that a girl whose age was seventeen years old was kidnapped in Europe. Her father who was an intelligence man in secret agent went to Europe to find his daughter during three days. He just had a few clues because he knew her kidnap when they were speaking over the phone. He tried to find her using his knowledge and information related with his job. Finally he found her from the traffickers of human being before she was sold by prostitute. Also they who kidnapped her were killed by him. He and his daughter went to back their home without any accidents. If he could not find his daughter within 72 hours he must have never found her because the kidnappers sold people to all over the world.
