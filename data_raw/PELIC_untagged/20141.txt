Living in Bangkok or Pittsburgh Tropical climate deep root of Asia's culture smiling people and spicy food are just a few things that represent Bangkok which is a city that I came from. On the other hand Pittsburgh is one of the cities in the states that different in many ways from the capital of Thailand. Even though I used to live in Bangkok for many years but now I am here in Pittsburgh which is well known in education and sports. There are three things that I decide to live in Bangkok instead of the steel city lifestyle weather and quality of life. I accustomed to living in Bangkok lifestyle that I have left for many years. My family is living there and also most of my friends. When I need someone to advice me for some problems I can access them easier than I live far away from them. Although Pittsburgh is on the other side of the world form Bangkok but I able to contact them by telephone email or MSN program. However it is better to talk to someone while you can be looking at their eyes than hearing only their voice. Bangkok has many restaurants that serve spicy food whereas Pittsburgh has a lot of international food. I like to try new thing but food is one thing that is difficult to do. I can have any kinds of food but if I can choose one I will choose spicy food which is easier to find them in Bangkok.
