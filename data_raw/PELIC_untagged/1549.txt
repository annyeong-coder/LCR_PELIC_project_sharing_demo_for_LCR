Across Embroidery From 3 yeays ago when I was a teenager I started to wmbroider . First time I just tried to do it the result was my work was a little ugly . Since than I tried it many times it became better and better . How did I do it First I saw a picture that designer already draw it I saw the picture and embroiderd on a specific fabric the fabric have many same distance small holes . Second I just needed to use different kind of lines crossed the holes . Third you do many times the same action and it become a beautiful picture . Maybe you will think do a across embroidery is very thing but you need know the holes are very small and you do it all day but you just can see a little different than before . You may feel backache and feel your eyes very tired because you need to pay attention on small things and continue it lone time . If you are a girl and you like quite and you can sit in one place long time and you like beautiful embroidery you can try it .
