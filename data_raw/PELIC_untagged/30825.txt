My Dream When I was a little girl I was dreaming of becoming a famous dancer who gives wonderful performances and is dressed up gorgeously in the front of the public. As I am grown up I would like to become a traveller who has the opportunity to travel around the world to experience different traditions to taste various kinds of food and to make friends with people under distinguished religious and cultural background. To make my dream come true I plan to take advantage of every minute of my spare time. When I was in China I spend a couple of weeks travelling around a lot of places such as Yunan the most beautiful province in China Jiangxi Hebei and Zhejiang Jiangsu. When I am here in the United States I have visited some places for instance Las Vegas San Francisco Los Angeles Monterey Bay San Diego New York. At present I am making my traveling plan of the coming winter.
