Learning English is hard for me especially listening and reading. If I want to improve my listening and reading skills I should practice them effectively. There are several ways to improve my listening and reading skills. First if I want to improve my listening skills I should try to listen a lot. For example I can watch TV or listen to the radio carefully. Watching TV is such an effective way to practice because I don't usually get bored. I can also go to the computer lab and review what I learned. I think reviewing is one of the best ways to improve my skills because I can get more information that I missed in class. Secondly if I want to improve my reading skills I should start to read something that I'm interested in. For example when I read a magazine which has a lot of information about health beauty or food I can continue reading the magazine and I can understand easily. So in that case I can practice reading effectively. Otherwise I'll be tired of practicing reading. I think memorizing vocabulary is also important to help reading. So when I have time I try to memorize some words in sentences because it's good to remember the words for a long time. Listening and reading are important because they're related to other things. For example after I practice listening many times I might speak more easily than before. Also after I read many things it can help me write easily than before. So I should practice them steadily to improve my skills.
