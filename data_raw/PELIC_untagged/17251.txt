I will take these things with me Fresh water matches fishing equipment fireworks and chocolate. You know the fresh water is important thing for our life especially in this place you do not find some water to drink in deserted island. Also you can not remain a long time with out drinking the water the basis of our life to be continued is water. The second thing are the matches you can light a fire by using it. It's very important to save yourself from the wild animals. And you can cook the food on the fire. Another one is fishing equipment you have to eat the meal which can you depended on the island is fish. And in my opinion you can try to rescue yourself by using the fireworks It's good method If somebody see it when you light it. And after your tired day you should enjoy your self by taken one bar of chocolate with the taste of it you can forget that you are alone on this island.
