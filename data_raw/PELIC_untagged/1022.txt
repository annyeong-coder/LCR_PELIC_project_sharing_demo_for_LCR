Oct. 22. 2006 Dear Daewon Hey how are you I want to buy shoes. I am thinking about two different kinds of shoes boots and running shoes. I can't decide because both have some similar things and different things. First their design is very different because the boots are longer than the running shoes and they're prettier than running shoes. Second the boots are less comfortable than running shoes so I can't wear the boots when I go to walk for exercise. Third the boots are warmer than running shoes but I can wear them only in winter. In contrast I can wear the running shoes anytime. Finally their prices are similar so it doesn't matter. Please consider about them and call me later. Bye.
