I had experienced an funny event when I went to cosco with my girlfriend. We had been going many times to cosco during we were together. On a rainy day it was very crowded there. Usually we had enjoyed our shopping but on this day we tried to buy our stuffs as fast as we could. We had always walked by the hands but for a moment we let our hands to grab something. After I grabed her hands again but I realized that she was more than 10 feets behind me. I was very surprised. Ever than I was surprised before. Because of the fact that I had been holding another woman's hand until I realized it. In addition the funny fact was that the woman hadn't been knowing either. She had been thinking that my hand was her boyfriends hand. My girlfriend was very angry about this situation but finally she began laughing. After this event she has been talking about it several times which has been making my mind feeling sorry for her. Finally it hasn't happened again because I has been very carefully who I has been walking by the hand.
