I felt frustrated when I talk to native speaker on the phone. I always kept on asking the person to repeat the question. Sometimes I can figure out every easily but most of time I really want to give up. I always try to talk myself into an insistence. It is a good opportunity to practice in English so that I told myself never hang up the phone before someone doing that.
