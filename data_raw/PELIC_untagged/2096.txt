I think the most memorable points for the writer is Without a winter sun without much wind the snow that falls here doesn't melt or blow away as it does back in Colorado where I usually ski. This point is the most memorable for me. I think for the writer while he was writing this point he thought about the same as in Colorado. This means when he can memorize his place where he stayed before. For me if I remember something in the past and I see something is similar to memorable thing in the past that will be another memorable point.
