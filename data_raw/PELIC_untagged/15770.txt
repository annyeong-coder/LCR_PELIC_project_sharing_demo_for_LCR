My family is considered as a peaceful family by the neighbors since we always look harmonious. The most important part to make us peaceful is uncle Dongsung. He looks chubby but he tries not to eat much. He has got a bald head but isn't ashamed. Though he has got kind of funny appearance he is happy to make us laugh. When he was a little boy he lost his father. He couldn't get loved and protected from his father. However that is why he is glad to make us happy because he knows how painful a family lives without an important member. I assume he is one of the most valuable person. I hope we'll stay together in the same village as long as possible so we can share his pain of the childhood as loving each other.
