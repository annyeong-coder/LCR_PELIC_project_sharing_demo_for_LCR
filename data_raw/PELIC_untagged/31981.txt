Hi I'm Hasan Hobani. I grew up in Jeddah Saudi Arabia. I've been studying English language in US for almost two years and now I almost to finish study English language. By the time I had bought a car I registered in Geico insurance. I had been playing soccer before I came to US. This month I had been playing 6 matches. In fact I have been thinking to go Chicago on spring break but the problem is my friend thinks we should go to New York.
