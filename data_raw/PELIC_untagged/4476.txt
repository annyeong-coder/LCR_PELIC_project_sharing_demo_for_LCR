Let me introduce you my room. First of all if you open my room's door you can see the small closet room in front of you and there are two chests near the closet room. I have a lot of clothes in the closet room and in the chests because I like shopping. Also there is a bed in front of chests. I dislike messy so usually my bed is clean and always a small lamp turns on because dark room makes me be scary. In addition there is a small table to the left of the bed and there is a stereo on the table. I turn music on when I clean my room or sleep. Additionally if you turn on the right slightly you can see two desks. There are a lot of books on my desk and there are some cookies and a cup of coffee on the desk. I usually eat delicious food during study. Finally there is a make up desk to the left of desk. My make up desk is also organized. When my mind is complexed I sometimes put all stuff in my make up desk and I organized them. It make my head be clean.
