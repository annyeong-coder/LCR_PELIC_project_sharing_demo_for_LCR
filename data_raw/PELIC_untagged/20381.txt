We will take a few matches to ignite the wood and great fire when the weather cold. Also we decided to take fishing equipment with us for hunting the fish. The fireworks are very important to sending signals when we in dangerous situation and to get some help. We think the cooking pot important to cook the food on it. Of course we need enough fresh water to survive. This is the items which we need in the trip.
