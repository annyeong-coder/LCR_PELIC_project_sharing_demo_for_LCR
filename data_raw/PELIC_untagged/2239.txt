I used to live in Spain. And here in the week I used to work in the morning and the afternoon I used to visit my grandmother and my family in the evening and I used to go English class on Tuesday and Thursday. And the weekend I used to go to the cinema I used to clean my house and car I used to go with my friends and I used to go the beach until November. And I used to go to the mall for shopping with my mother and I used to go different restaurant for lunch or dinner with my parents and my brother. Now I'm living in Pittsburgh I'm learning English in University of Pittsburgh and I'm living with my family. Here I'm doing different things I'm shopping in different places that my country I'm eating in different restaurant and I'm eating different food I'm visiting sister's friends and I'm speaking with people of different nationalities.
