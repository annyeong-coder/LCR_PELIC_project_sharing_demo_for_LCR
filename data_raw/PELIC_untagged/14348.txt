Pare Pare where I have been spent my childhood is a small city on the South Sulawesi of Indonesia. My family and I lived in a simple house which built from my fathers' salary as a Taylor. When I was three teen we moved to the house that my brother bought from his colleagues. This house where my parents still live is near by soldiers' camp. My father had a space on the first floor where he sewed the soldiers' uniform. Most of his customers whom I always chatted with were very friendly to me. One day on of my fathers' customer came to me and asked to joint him for soccer competition at downtown. I forgot the day when the competition was begin.
