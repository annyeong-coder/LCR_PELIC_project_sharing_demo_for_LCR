I have been most influenced by my ex boss. Actually he is my first boss and the most helpful boss until now. When I was a fresher I was taught by him that how to be a good employer. My values about job and company were formed because his attitude on the working. I was helped by him to do many things which were not only about work but also everything. I was changed by hime from a student to a employer. He will always be remembered by me.
