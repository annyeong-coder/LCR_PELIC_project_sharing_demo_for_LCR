I forgot to bring a black wallet to go to a store once. When I visited to my sister's house I played with a nephew who was four years old. I went to the store with the nephew after we played in a park. The nephew wanted to drink some apple juice but I didn't bring the wallet. And then I called my sister if she brought it or not. She came to the store after a few minutes. The nephew got some apple juice and I got a cup of coffee. We went back to the park after we drank it. The nephew enjoyed the park with a lot of sand.
