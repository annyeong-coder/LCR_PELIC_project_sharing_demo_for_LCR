My hometown I'm from Nara in Japan that is countryside. My home town is historical one. Kyoto which is the most historical old city is adjacent to Nara thus we can enjoy both history if you come to my hometown. Moreover Japan has four different seasons a year. Similarly Nara has each season which has each distinct climate. Especially in autumn we have quite serene and beautiful season. Most of our foods such as vegetable fish fruit become to have good tastes in this time. Probably Many aspects which can be climate have an ifluence on foods.
