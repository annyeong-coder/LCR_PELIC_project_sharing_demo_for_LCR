Almost all people's life affects easily by other people even though people is different each other. We usually grow up with family and friend but I think family affects really to us. I want to compare friends and family in life. First Our personality resemble parents. While I was growing up I knew about my family's personality. When I decided I will not resemble my parent's one but now I think my personality is close with parents. My friends are good people and have good personality but now we have different character . Second Our decision such as future discuss with family. I want to get financial job surely it affected my father. My father worked in stock option company and I have seen his life while I was growing up. Actually I talk with my friend about serious problem such as getting a job but I decide my future with my parents. Individually people's thinking is very different so someone may say I affected my friend in life. Even though people affected friend I think the family is the most important influence in our life. I want to say that all of society is based on the family.
