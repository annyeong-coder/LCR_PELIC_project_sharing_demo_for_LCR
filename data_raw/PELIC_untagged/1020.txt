Oct 16 2006 Dear Scot I'm glad to send this letter to you. I heard you're planning to visit Pittsburgh next year. Also you asked me to give some informations about buying a Steelers' ticket and buying a Pirates' ticket. I know you want to see their games. You are always interested in sports. I think the games of Steelers and Pirates are both exciting for you. You may see the games of Steelers and Pirates both when you visit to Pittsburgh. However there are some differences between buying a Steelers' ticket and buying a Pirates' ticket. First of all the ticket prices of Steelers' games are usually more expensive than Pirates' games. Next I think buying a Steelers' ticket is much harder than buying a Pirates' ticket for you. A Steelers' single game ticket sale is held in May via mail order only. If you want to see a Steelers game you should buy the ticket in May via mail order. In contrast you can buy a Pirates' ticket easily. When the Pirates have a game you can buy the ticket before the game via the Pirates' homepage visiting PNC PARK and telemarketing etc. In conclusion I prefer to see a Pirates game because buying a Pirates' ticket is easier and cheaper than buying a Steelers' ticket. However that is only my opinion you can choose the games that you want. I really want to see you as soon as possible. If you make sure about your plan to visit Pittsburgh please tell me. Sincerely
