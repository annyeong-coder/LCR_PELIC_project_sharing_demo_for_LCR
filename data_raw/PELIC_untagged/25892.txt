I would like to meet a soul mate who thinks like me and to whom the passion to listen is remarkable. I am looking for a person that will always cheer me up when I break down. My soul mate is someone whose ability of figuring out the problem is effective. My life will be stable and balanced if I meet a soul mate whose life is in harmony and full of love. She will always have time to hang around in the marvelous garden which is in a beautiful park. I'd really like to live the rest of my life with someone to whom I can count on and to whom the compassion honesty loyalty and the affection are the religion of our everyday lives.
