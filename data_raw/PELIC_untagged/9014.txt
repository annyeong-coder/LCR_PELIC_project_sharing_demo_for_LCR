October 11 About a month ago ANON_NAME_0 was late for work again and ANON_NAME_1 our boss told me he wanted to fire him. I was so angry of course ANON_NAME_0 should not have been late so often but he might thought a lot before he let him go. I just pretended I did not hear him. Any way ANON_NAME_0 is still here but now I am worried about my own job. I do not know maybe I should have handled things differently last month. The company should never have hired this person!
