First We need to acquire the basics of the English language to be able to study at ELI. Initial level is a lower intermediate then intermediate then advanced level. Obviously no one can enter to the ELI Institute unless he has intermediate level of English. Al the classes are relevant to the academic English so you will be able to go to academic study once you finish your studying at ELI. Some student does not achieve this target level because they did not study every day while they are in the school.
