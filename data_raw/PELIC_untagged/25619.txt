I feel comfortable and happy in my home. I always wake up early and clean up my room. Also I hang up my clothes. Then I hang out with my friends to have fun and go to movie theater in the weekend and go to a party. My friend drinks too much so I take away his car keys. I usally come back home late and take the trash out. Then turn the TV on and stay up untill 3 o'clock and take off my clothes and sleep.
