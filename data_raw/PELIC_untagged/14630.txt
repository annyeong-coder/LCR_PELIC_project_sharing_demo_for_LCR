For me my future still uncertian. The certain thing is I am going to studty here next term. At the beginning of December I am going to visit my grandparents and friend in China. I might have a good time over there. It's been a long time I am so exciting. I am going to back at the end of December. I am going to work with my father again At that time I am going to work hard and study hard. I might go to college just uncertain. That is my current plans.
