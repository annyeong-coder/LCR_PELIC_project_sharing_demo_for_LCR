I feel cozy in my apartment. Aside from the noise it is very comfortable. I brought my favorite pictures from Japan. I have framed a couple of them and put them up in my bedroom. I always look at them when I am feeling homesick and I wake up. I feel hugely cheered up by them. In addition I set a sofa down in the center of my room. I sit down on the sofa when I come back to my apartment. Sometimes I lie on a couch with my feet up on the arm. Next I try to straighten my room up but my apartment does not have enough a storage space. I decided to throw out a thing that one no longer needs. In addition my room is lighting dimly lit room. I want to light up my room with illumination lamp. I keep on making up my room.
