When you drive a car in Pittsburgh you must keep traffic legal you must be aware of this well and obey a policeman's authority. First of all when there is steady red light you have to stop before crossing line and crosswalk. You may turn light while the light is red unless a NO TURN ON RED SIGN at intersection. When you hear a fire engine siren you must pull over to the side of road and stop.
