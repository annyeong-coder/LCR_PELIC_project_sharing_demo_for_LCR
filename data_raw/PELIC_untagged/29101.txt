Nowadays it is a trend that many teenagers and children started to play video games. Also there is a rule against that some video games can only sell to people over 17 but many people just ignore the rule which are set by the government. They think that they have their own right to decide what they can buy. In my opinion some video games have negative effects on teenagers and children people who are under 17 should not violate the rule.
