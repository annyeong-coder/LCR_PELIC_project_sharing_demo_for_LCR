Initially I went to the United States to achieve the target of speaking English fluently. However soon after the ELI classes started I found that there were more things worth to do than just spending time in learning. Obviously I should treasure every moment and try to experience as many new things as I can whether those are relevant to my study or not. Therefore I already bought the tickets for baseball game and Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra. I know I will enjoy it! I hope to acquire much unique and special experience that I can recall forever.
