I do many things before and when I start writing. For example I clean the desk and the floor before I do home work and make Arabic coffee. I always turn off any thing that has sound because I can't study if I am listening any sound. Then I make a plan for any paragraph I want to write. Before I start writing I make a list of words which I want to use in my paragraph . Then I start writing . When I finish my paragraph I check the spelling . For example I check all the sentences by computer.
