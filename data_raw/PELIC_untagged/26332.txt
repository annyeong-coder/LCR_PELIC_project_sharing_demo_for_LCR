Muslims have two holidays in the year Eid Alfetr and Eid Aladha . Eid Alfetr comes after Rma'9an which is the holy month for Muslims. We call it Eid al fetr because we break fasting this day after we fasted the hole month before. This holiday is really special occasion for us. We have lots of customs we do in this day and we make lots of preparations before it comes.
