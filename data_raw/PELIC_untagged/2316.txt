Five years ago my friends and I were visiting my classmate's house in another city. The city is far from our city about five hours by train and bus. My classmate took us by a train because a ticket was cheaper than a bus. We were taking a train 11 30 PM. This is the first time for us took a train midnight. We were excited when we were taking in the train we did not have a seat because it was full. Many people sat on the floor that included us we sat on the newspaper which my classmate brought it. On the train had four toilets that not enough to people so a smell stank that made my friends and I could not sleep all the night until we took off that train. We through this journal were very terrible for us but we were happy as visiting this city. I through if my father allowed me drove a car our journal must be comfortable than this. One my friend said next time we will have to get a good journal because her father is buying a car to her pretty soon.
