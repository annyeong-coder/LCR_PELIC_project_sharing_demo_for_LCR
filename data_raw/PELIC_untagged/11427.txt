Have you ever heard of the Irish blessing There are many types of ships. There are wooden ships plastic ships and metal ships. But the best and most important ships are friendships. I fully agree with this saying and it is my favorite proverb. People are social animals which mean we can not live alone and we have to live with people. Friends are energy of our life we are not lonely because of our friends. Also friends are listeners. They listen to our worries and sometimes they give us advice and news. Some people think that love is more important than friendship. However I think long lasting love seems very difficult but friendships are forever. I know a phrase which is about friendship but I don't know who said this. If you fall down a best friend will not try to make you stand but will just fall down next to you. That is the real friend. It sounds weird but it means that best friend have to share a shame. My best friend Mee jin was in the class in my 7th grade. She is the person who I spent half of my life with. I spent my immature years my school life with her. I can not remember that how we became friends but I remember she was a student who was very smart and friendly. I could easily talk about my concern. We did not end up in the same high school and university but we easily met up. She lived in the apartment which is a minute walking away from my home. Even though now we are apart we still talk to each other on messenger. I really appreciate that she is my friend. Now she has a problem which is related with her boy friend who serves in the military. I hope she can resolve that problem. I really miss her.
