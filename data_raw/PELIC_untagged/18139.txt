1 When I get admission in the university I'll make a big party. 2 If I live with American family I'll improve my English. 3 Unless I practice a lot of tests I won't pass the TOEFL. 4 In case I won the lottery I'll give you the half of it. 5 Because the traffic we won't be on time. 6 After I did my assignment I'll eat a diner. 7 As soon as I get your mail I'll send it back. 8 Once I reach the city I'm going to take a rest. 9 Before I come back I'll visit you. 10 Although I'm busy I'll go to ELI picnic.
