Living in an island is not my ultimate passion but things might change because I love being surrounded by beautiful nature greens blues and golden sand. One day I might not resist this obsessive idea and plan a lifetime trip to Maldives. I know life in an island is primitive so I have to consider taking many important things if I want to enjoy my time there. First of all I have to maintain my personal hygiene. Then I must have a blow dryer and some makeup we could have parties sometimes. Also I should have my luck stone and my charm which my mother gave me to hold them wherever I go. Unfortunately I will not be able to take my laptop and cell phone but at least I could have a solar camera to capture my beautiful memories. Now I do not have to worry about where I am going to live what I am going to eat or drink because I can sleep on earth covered by sky and live on water and air. It could be a heaven on earth.
