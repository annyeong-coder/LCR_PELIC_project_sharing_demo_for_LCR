Korean Career Women Who are the Korean career women They are women who work for an enterprise company in Korea. It seems that it is more difficult for women to successed than for men to successed in Korea. There are several reasons why it is difficult. First of all the belief of preferring a son to a daughter is attributed to that situation. For example my company has 55 directors among 38 000 employees but there are only 3 women directors. They seem to believe that important jobs have to take men. Nowadays that belief is changing but it still remains. In addition there are many activities after office hours such as drinking. These activities sometimes bring about important businesses. However many women might do not like drinking and especially married women have not enough time. She has to do the housework such as taking care of their children or cooking for family. Although it is not easy for women to be successful in their company I have seen that some women got ahead. Successful women share some similar features. They have leadership responsibility and diligence. Not only that but they are able to use their networking skills and they are healthy both physically and mentally. As I have mentioned it is difficult for women to be as successful as men. Nevertheless many women are outstanding in their business. I hope to become a wise career women.
