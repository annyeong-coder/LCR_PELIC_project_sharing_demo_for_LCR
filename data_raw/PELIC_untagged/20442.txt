I got my student visa last year. Before I get the visa I had been collecting all necessary documents for the day of my appointment at the embassy a month in advance. I was ready for my interview with embassy official and go to the U. S. But the embassy did not give answer immediately and I had three months without receiving any response. I had thought that they had rejected my visa I was very sad for the situation. But one day they called me exactly two days before the classes begin and I had finally been approved. I bought my plane ticket that same day the next two days I had left my home family and friends to come to America to live a new experience.
