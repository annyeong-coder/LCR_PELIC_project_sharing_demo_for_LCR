Home is a place you grow up wanting to leave and grow old wanting to get back to. I think this means that home is a restriction when you are young and reliance when you grow old. The place where my parents live is home to me. My parents disciplined my brother whom I fought with constantly and me when we were kids. They regulated our behavior in a way which we don't like. Also they forced us to work hard when we want to play outside. I can't perceive their love completely at that time. I always looked forward to grow up and leave the city where my parents live. Now I am a mom of someone. I understand my parents' heart definitely. I feel sad when I see my parents whose hair turn write because they grow old imperceptibly. They are the best parents whom I never see in the world. They are reliable for me whenever I am happy or upset. I really want to go back to home in which I spent my happy childhood and do what I could do to take care of them. They are physically old but they still the spirit of me.
