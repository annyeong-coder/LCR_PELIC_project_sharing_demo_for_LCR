Since 2005 I have moved to new house in my hometown. When I got a job since 2010 I have bought a new car. Since 2006 I have taken my high school certificate. I have played soccer for many years. When I came to the USA I have styed in Washington DC for 2 days. I have already visited New York but I haven't visited Florida yet. I have already taken the toefl test in New Jersey but I haven't got the score yet. I have already bought a Mac from mac store her in Pittsburgh but I haven't bought a case for it yet. Here in the USA every thing is expensive. I want buy a car but I haven't yet because it's expensive. In the end of this semester I will travel to my country but I haven't bought a ticket
