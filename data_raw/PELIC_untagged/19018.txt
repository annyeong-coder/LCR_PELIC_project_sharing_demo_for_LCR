Maui is the place that I want to go all over the world. I went the Maui for my honeymoon in 2006. I counldn't forget the experience when I was in there. Expecailly the sea breeze nice sunshine waves of see and very soft sand made me to be relaxed. I could swim anytime I want and I could enjoy the sun light anytime as well. The other unforgetable experience is Hawaiian traditional messages it was called Malei Wailea . I and my husband were so tired after wedding and long flight trevel. It was so fantastic to get a message with lisening soft music and watching beutiful sea. In addition the food in Maui was so delicious. I tasted the big BBQ which was made by the Hawaiian traditional recipies. The fruit such as pineapples was so jucy adn sweat. All restaurants in Maui that I went were great. Finally the weather was very nice. Even though I went there in the summuer I could not feel so hot. The sunshine is nice enough to do outside activities and the temperature was almost 60 70F degrees. For these reasons I would like to visit Maui one more time. I will do almost same things that I did before. I will swim in the sea and in the swimming pool. I will eat delicious food in famous restaurents and I will get the Hawaiian traditional messages. This time I will go there with my daughter who is 2 years old. I will look for good outdoor activities with her such as wathcing baby animals. Maui is the best place to go and hope to have great time with my family in Maui again.
