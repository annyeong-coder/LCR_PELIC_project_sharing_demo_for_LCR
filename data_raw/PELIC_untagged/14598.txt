When I was preparing to come to America I had some problems. At first I didn't exchange much money because of the high exchange rate but I should have exchanged more money at that time before the rate got higher. Otherwise I ought to have checked the exchange rate frequently and I ought not to have exchanged all of the money at once. I was running out of time until my departure date. I should not have worked near the date. Then I could have seen more friends and relatives. Also I might have had more time to make arrangements for moving.
