In Valentine day everyone gives greeting cards or red flowers to someone who love. I usually give special gift to someone I really love her. I spent around 4 wonderful years with her and I would like to spend all my life with her. When I saw her for the first time I didn't sleep that night I still woke up until morning because I was thinking about how can I be Close to her She is very special smart sweet and honest. I usually like to talk to her over and over without pausing and I enjoy that. During this time I didn't think for one time to leave her or do something that maybe will hurt her and she is doing the same thing for me because we are in love. If I have a chance to choose another person to spend my life with I will choose her again immediately without hesitated. We usually spoke to each other everyday for 3 or 4 hours. We spent a lot of hours talking about everything that I had and that I want to do or have and she was listening when I was talking without any word. Nowadays when I remember those days I feel good because I am so lucky to have a person like her in my life. Do you want to know who is she She is my WIFE
