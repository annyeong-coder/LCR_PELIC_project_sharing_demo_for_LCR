In two months ago I went to Nineportion with my friends in Taiwan. This is a beautiful place and a lot of mountains. There were two days on a trip. My friends had a birthday party to me. The first day we went to climbing up the Teapot Mountain all day. In the evening we prepared to some games and lots of foods including chicken beef port and fresh seafood. Then we played a wii game and ate a chocolate cake and sang a song. The second day we went to Chinshan spa. The spa near the Pacific Ocean is a famous place. The weather was so cold so we felt very comfortable. At the same time we took a lot of pictures and drank a little water. Finally we brought a few things on the street in the Nineportion. This trip made me very happy.
