Next Monday I will be flying back home but before it happens I have a lot of things to do here. Tomorrow Wednesday I have a lunch with some friends all of whom are ELI students after that I want to visit Carnegie Museum. On Thursday after finishing classes I'm going to go to Prime Outlets where I will intend to find Christmas gifts for all my family. Friday morning before the closing ceremony in the ELI I will spend some time in The Andy Warhol Museum. I'm also invited to a Brazilian party that night which is supposed to be very funny I hope it will have good music and delicious caipirinha. It is impossible to know what is going to happen on Saturday because I will be under the noxious influence of the brazilian alcohol so it is a missed day. On Sunday having left the hangover behind I will prepare my suitcase and if I have some time left I would like to cut my hair before leaving because yesterday my mother said that the weather in Santiago was becoming hot. Had I learned it before I would have gotten my hair cut the last week. I know it is advisable for travelers not to procrastinate relevant things but now it is too late.
