I've read the quote by Diane Arbus. I think it means a trip all over the world and look for new places he has never visited before. He wants to see what the world looks like. I agree with him. I've been to Egypt Malta Tunisia Morocco and Canada it's great. I have learned about different customs try different food and see different sights. I've never been on Europe South America and Asia. I will hope one day to visit one of them.
