My favorite place to eat lunch in Okland. There are many places to eat in Okland and most of them are very good and famous. I went to most of them but only two are my favorite places Quaker Steak Lobe restaurant and Chipotle Mexican restaurant . These two restaurants are my favorite places to eat lunch because they have fried Chicken and slices of pizza also not expensive and the workers in these restaurants are friendly
