Two years ago I got a job as web designer in the ministry of high education in my country. My boss asked me to design a web page for his essays and after I finish designing it He told me to do another one for his freind and he shouldn't have asked to do it because it's not one of my my tasks . But he might have asked me at first in polite way if I agree or not . As a result he became so mean to me . Then I quit my job . Now I think that I should have done this for his freind . Maybe I should have treated this situation in difrent way .
