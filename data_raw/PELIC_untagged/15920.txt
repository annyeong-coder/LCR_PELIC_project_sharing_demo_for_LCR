In many countries are different laws when people can get their driver's license. In some countries people can make their driver license under 18. In my opinion really young people shouldn't get driver's license under 18. First teenager are too young and haven't any responsibilities. They drive cars for fun and think to have a car is cool. For example when many teenagers are together and they want to make a trip with the car they drive fast because they talk together and don't pay enough attention on the street. In addition teenager cannot assess any dangerous or difficult situations. If a teenager gets into a dangerous situation maybe he she doesn't recognize that or maybe he she can't help. For instance if it gets spontaneously black ice the driving conditions are changed. This situation is certainly for all drivers difficult and dangerous. But how can someone deal with that without any experience and awareness I think teenager shouldn't get his her driver's license before 18 because the abilities of responsibilities are not develop. Also they aren't make own difficult decisions at this age.
