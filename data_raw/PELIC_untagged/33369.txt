Last year on March 11st when I woke up I found that my right leg did not work and I could not stand up. I called my boss and told not to be able to work that day. Around on 3 pm the earth began to quake suddenly. By the time it ended I had been staying in my bed. As soon as it had gone I tried to call 911 or taxi but it was out of work. I crawled and went out my room but the elevator was also out of work so I had to crawled steps. Afterwards I asked for a man to call 911 but he told me that all cell phones and electricity was not working. I finally got to public phones with crawling however there were so many people who were irritated. After waiting for a long time I called 911 and it told me that all ambulance had been out so I needed to wait more than 3 hours. After 3 hours I rode an ambulance for the first time in my life. I was sent a hospital which was not so far from my home but it took a long time because of traffic jam. I got a pain relief medicine but I needed to go back by myself. The subway was stopped due to the earthquake so I took a bus. I had always walked the same distance about 15 minutes but he road was so crowded I had never experienced before that it took 3 hours. I think that my leg pain should have happened 3 10!!
