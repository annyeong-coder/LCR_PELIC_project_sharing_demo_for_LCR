Dear confused This is really a dilemma for you. Everybody wants true love but not everyone has the fortune to acquire it. You have found your love and you're a lucky woman for the lucky guy but unfortunately it happened that your parents can't accept your choice. If you want my advice I will advise you to consider this relationship more carefully go home at the end of the semester and get Jim to visit your parents. The first solution is considering it more carefully. It is an important choice for your rest of life so I suggest that you should calm down first and then deliberate whether you love Jim or not or just a transient feeling of ardor. You could consider it carefully and try to make your mind. If you are sure that Jim is your Mr. Right you should come home first. It is truth that you love your parents and they also love you. Your parents didn't urge you to get over Jim immediately but come home first. In my judgment I believe that your parents just want to protect you and make sure you do love Jim. Why don't you go home first and show your love and respect to your parents and let your parents know how you do really care about them. And then you could try to convince your parents of your choice. The finally and best solution is that if Jim really love you he will understand and then he can visit your parents in Japan for you. If Jim wants to spend his rest of life with you I believe that he could show his respect to your parents when he visit them and you both can persuade them together. For three solutions above I advise you could consider your relationship go home first and convince your parents with Jim. It is better that making your decision right than regretting it. No matter what will happen after three months I hope that you can solve this problem with Jim together make the right decision about your life and have a wonderful and happy future. Regards Advisor
