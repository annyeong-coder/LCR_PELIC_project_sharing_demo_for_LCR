My favorite korean food is Kimchi. First Kimchi is one of Korean traditional food so I have always had meal with Kimchi. There are several types of kimchi but among them I prefer pickled cabbage kimchi to any other types of Kimchi. Second Kimchi tastes spicy. Since I like spicy food I can not stop eating Kimchi every meal. In addition I can make new food by using it such as Kimchi stew Kimchi pie Kimchi fried rice and so on. Finally it is good for health because of its effect of anti cancer. That is why I like a Kimchi.
