Ways to meet people in a new place There are some ways to meet people in a new place. The first way is try to be a volunteer. To be a volunteer you can help others prepare everything about the activity and contact different groups. For example when I was a Toy Lending Library volunteer I met a lot of mothers. We shared experiences on the education of children cooking and public activities. Another good way is to go to church. In church the priest gives us topics to discuss so we exchange ideas. We also take part in activities of church and communicate with each other. The third way is to go to your child's school. There we can meet the teachers and other parents. We can talk with each other and ask for available information. Also we can hold a party for the children and it is a good chance to know new friends. All in all we need proper ways to meet people in a new place.
