Of course to become fluent speaker you must speak hear read and write in a second language constantly. For example I and my friends who grew up in non English speaking countries even after many years of learning a foreign language at school as the majority of people in these countries can only say a few isolated things in the foreign language. Nevertheless a foreign language instruction in kindergarten gives children a possibility to build the base for further easier studying a foreign language. Thus knowledge of a second or even third language is one of the most important features of education to find a good job travel around the World converse with different people. I think it is necessary useful and helpful for children to start studying a foreign language in kindergarten because it will give them a lot of benefits and advantages when they become adults.
