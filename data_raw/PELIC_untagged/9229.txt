My father is a fashionable man. His hair is dark and curly. He always sets his hair by himself and looks so neat. He is not a very tall man but his medium height and average weight just fit his personality. He wears glasses and looks like a teacher. He likes to dress in suits when he goes to work. Also he always has a warm smile on his face so he is a charming man. My father is not only fashionable he is also responsible. He loves his job and loves our family. When I was little he always worked too late at his company so he left me with the impression of his tireless work. But he helped my mother to do some homework each weekend and also taught me and my sister to play some sports such as badminton table tennis and swimming if he had some free time. Of course he was strict with us about our study. He is a good father. My father receives the most praise for being a punctual person and he is also known for keeping his promise. I respect him very much for this part. My father often gives me some advice when I am troubled about my work or other things. He really likes a good teacher in my life I love my father.
