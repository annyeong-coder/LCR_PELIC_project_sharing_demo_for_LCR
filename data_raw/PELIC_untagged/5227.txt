My country I am from Saudi Arabia. Today I am going to talk about several things in my country. What I am writing here it is not about every city about it. There are some sight seeing are good to write about it. Al Riyadh is the capital of Saudi Arabia. The architecture in it is the best in all country. There are a lot of palaces. In addition it has buildings for many famous companies such as Omega and Microsoft. Finally It has the biggest stadium in Saudi. I hope I wrote enough about the architecture in al Riyadh. The west is the best place to go on a vacation. It has the most popular beach. Furthermore It has pleasant weather. In the summer it is that hot but it has a little humidity. In the winter you can go to the beach and swim all the time because it is never become cold. It is the capital of pretty in Saudi Arabia. The east is very clean and safe. It has the biggest companies for oil. It contains many places from all over the world. It is the perfect place to start your own businesses. Finally I wish I wrote something you can lean about my country.
