I think that the Online shopping is not bad for environment. I didnt know what is bad reason for environment from the Online shopping before I read this Chapter's paragraph but It's not big problem. Absolutely the wrapping and fuel problem for heavy items by airplane are not good for environment but if you were disabled person can you buy something in shop whenever you want to go shopping The Online shopping solved this problem. Who can help them family cousin or neighbor how can they do everytime We could think that Online shopping has serious problem of environment but I think we can do effort to decline the enviornment problem! From wrritten ways in the article. We have to be careful before buy something on the online and the company must think how to protect the environment with some ideas in selling or deliverying. We can get over all of it so I agree with this opinion but I disagree a little bit.
