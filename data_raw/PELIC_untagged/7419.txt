The first point is potsherds archaeologists can know the age of the civilization from the potsherds. In this article the archaeologists didn't find anything in Caral. That means Caral could be preceramic. The archaeologists can use this tradegy to find the age for other cultures too. The second point is hierarchy. There were a hi erarchy in living arrangement like others cultures. Some cultures arranged poor people to be slaves for elite people or rich people and lived in a part of their house. In Calar they arranged the large well kept rooms atop the pyramids for the rich and elite ground level complexes for craftsmen and older and poorer homes far from the city center for workers. The third point is trading. Rich or elite people in many cultures were able to trade products from other cities to show the class distinctions as same as Caral. They imported necklaces of snails and the seeds of the coca plant which was used by rich and elite people.
