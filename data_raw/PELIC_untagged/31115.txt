I remember the first time I came to Pittsburgh. I needed to know how Pittsburgh looked like. Also I wonder what the character of people there was. When I arrived the snow welcomed me. That the weather was too cold surprised me. I was not sure whether this cold weather would end soon. I met some people at the hotel that I booked and talked to them. The fact that the people are friendly was obvious. At that time I did not have a clue where the cathedral of learning was so I became anxious. Also I did not know how far it was from the hotel. After that a friend of mine came and told me everything about Pittsburgh and the ELI.
