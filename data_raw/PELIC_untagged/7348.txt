I have already traveled to several beautiful cities such as Paris Lyon France Madrid Spain Venice Italy Wolfsburg Germany Innsbruck Austria Mexico City Mexico Johannesburg South Africa Hong ANON_NAME_0 Beijing Yunnan China and New York. I have walked on the most fantastic Avenue des Champs Elysees and shopped like a crazy woman. I have taken a Gondola through the rivers in Venice. I have been dead drunk with the famous Germany's beer in a pub in Wolfsburg. I have seen the most amazing beautiful Swarovski crystals in Innsbruck. I have stood on the top of the Maya Pyramid and felt the magic of ancient culture in Mexico. Although I have gone to many places but I still want to go to some places that I have never seen with my own eyes. I would like to see the blue sky and the green Aegean Sea in Greece. I would like to have an adventure in wild Africa. I would like to touch the mysterious pyramid with my own hand in Egypt. The whole world is very big and I hope I can remember all the sceneries that I have seen in my mind.
