In 2006 I was a senior in electrical engineering school in Thailand. As I was talking with my professor and my friends we heard a crash on the road nearby us. And then we saw a man who rode a motorcycle and his helmet slid along the road in different way. Surprisingly he didn't sustain any severe injury even though he didn't put on his helmet. After that he was held his hand by a student nearby there to help him stand. My friend told me that he had been crashed by a car. When I went closer I saw a container which he held when was riding the motorcycle was broken. The motorcycle was damage and some of his belongings were fallen on the road.
