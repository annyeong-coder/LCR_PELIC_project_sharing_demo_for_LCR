When I came to Pittsburgh I did not set up everything for a while. I looked into my apartment by searching the Internet. I used to live in Schenley apartment on the north craig street. It was efficient room so little bit small. I tried to take away some stuff which did not need them such as old magazines boxes and old chairs. It was too dark room. I should light up on the corner. However there was a red couch it was really nice. I used to sit down and watch the TV. Under the couch it had fully fur carpet. In winter it made me heat the room but I should straighten it up. I moved to another apartment on May 1st. It was located in Melwood Avenue in Oakland. It was one bed room. I have enough space but there were not any plants. I put two plants which were a cactus and a tropical plant on the window sill. It makes cheer me up everyday. I tried to put something on the wall because all white walls look seriously like hospital. I bought a flower painting from Russian artist who is an ELI student I love that painting. When I throw away garbage it has only one place behind my apartment door so it is little bit inconvenient. Except garbage place I am really satisfied my apartment.
