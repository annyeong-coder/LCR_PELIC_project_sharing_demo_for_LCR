A tornado might have appeared in other areas and passed through rivers or lakes. Then it could have lifted fish in air. The fish might have traveled a long distance because some cyclones may have arisen consecutively and continued holding it in cloud. After the power of the cyclone declined the fish had to fall down. It couldn't have happened that someone carried the great deal of fish by plane at the same time.
