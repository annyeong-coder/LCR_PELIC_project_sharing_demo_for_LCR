Increasing the number of tourists to my home country would be both a good and a bad thing. It would be good for different reasons. One of them is that many people will learn more about our culture. This will help to eliminate the misrepresented image of our culture around the world. Moreover it is crucial for our economics to have millions of people come from all over the world and spend their money in our country. On the other hand bad things could be triggered by increasing number of tourists to my country. It might cause inflation. Prices will not be stable because large number of tourists are visiting our country each year. In addition huge number of tourists means more cars airplanes and trains will be needed for transportation which will have negative effects on my country's climate.
