Topic 1 Viewpoint B Universities pay too much attention to standardized test scores such as SAT TOEFL and GRE. It is too much hard to take a high score of those tests and students spend a lot of time to studying them. However they should continue to be used as a main factor for admission because there are increasing number of students who want to admit university and there are no ways to identify the all students. To begin it is hard to evaluate applicants without objective data and choose each person impartially. A lot of students have different conditions of studying so they have to certify their level of study. For example in Korea the maximum GPA score is 4. 5 And in Saudi the highest core is 4. 3 But the U. S is 4. 0 So it should be adjust to the same data when we apply to international school. In addition standardized tests are related with university's lectures. The scores can identify that the students who are applying to the universities are fit to the classes. In my case I have prepared TOEFL for apply to the master degree. It has four sections Reading Listening Speaking Writing and all parts are related with the university's lecture and conversation. If I admit to the university I could easily adapt myself to the university. Some people say the universities should not be used regular test score as the main factor for admission. Comparatively few universities do not need the test scores for admission. However many universities want the test score and it means that they pay attention to make distinction between each student. In conclusion if we want to apply the university they will need a lot of forms such as ESSAY SOP and test score. But there is the priority order to choose the student then I think university pay more attention to standardized test score.
