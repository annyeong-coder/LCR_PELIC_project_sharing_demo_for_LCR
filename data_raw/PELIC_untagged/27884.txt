Before coming to Pittsburgh I lived in a small city called Mainz in Western Germany. I lived in an apartment with two friends who were also students. What I took every morning to wake up was a coffee that I prepared in a small Moka which is a typical Italian coffee pot. Once while I was preparing my morning time coffee and reading the newspaper at the same time I forgot my coffee on the hotplate. That a Moka triggers a lot of smoke can be sometimes problematic. Indeed instead of coffee what woke me up was the fire alarm that started to ring loudly. In order to evacuate the smoke I opened all windows of the apartment. Since it wasn't enough I went to the hallway outside my apartment and opened the window there too. Unfortunately the door of my apartment was closed by a draft while I was outside. That I was outside my apartment without a key and with only my underpants while inside the fire alarm was ringing was at that time not funny. My neighbor who was a grand mother came to the hallway to see what was happening and started to laugh when I explained her the situation. To reenter my apartment I went on the balcony of my neighbor which was separated from mine by a wall. Fortunately I managed to climb my balcony and get into my apartment through the door of the balcony which I opened previously to evacuate the smoke. I was then able to turn off the alarm dressed up and finally drink a coffee with the neighbor who couldn't stop laughing.
