Hi new student There is some advice you should look at for easy adaptation for living here. You should find a temporary residence for a few days until you find the appropriate one. You ought to read about the different culture and know about the structures and laws here. Also you ought to be a good ambassador of your country. Furthermore you shouldn't depend on the English learning in the E. L. I only but you should listen to the radio and watch T. V as mush as you can. Moreover you should speak with people outside. You'd better not talk with people with your native language or your English won't be improved quickly. In addition you shouldn't be absent from E. L. I more than 8 days in order to get the attendance certificate in the end of the term. For any more information you should see E. L. I website and get the guider from ANON_NAME_0. Enjoy your stay here and study hard. Regard best wishes Formal student
