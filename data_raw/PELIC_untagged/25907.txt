When I studied in senior high school I had a girlfriend who has sweet smile and beautiful face. At that time I had believed that she was the girl who will be married with me. However I gradually familiar with her I realized she was a girl who could not understand my feelings. Therefore I understood that the soul mate who has empathy is much appropriated for me. Now I know that soul mate is someone who will care about you and she who has wisdom to understand your feelings can figure out what you are worry about.
