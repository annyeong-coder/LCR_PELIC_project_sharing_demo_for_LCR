Racism makes me sick I saw a white and black picture today in class. In that picture there is a man a black man with no clothes looks at you with hollow eyes. In the middle of the picture there is a slogan says Racism makes me sick. It affects my blood pressure and creates anxiety and depressed. When I saw this picture first time it makes me sad and feels nothing I can do for it. In the mean time I thought there were less racism in the world now. It is because my education background taught me that we should respect to everyone even though they are different from you. Majority does not mean you are powerful. Minority still have their right. We can not discriminate to the people who are different from us. Before I came to United States I have to find a place to stay. My friends always remind me that there are more black people in some areas and it is better not to live in that area. It is because we usually consider black people as crime. However we all know the fact is that the color of your skin does not mean anything. We were born with that color and can not change it. It is just some stereotype. Before you judge other people think twice and wear other's shoes. No one like other people looks at you with weird eyes. It hurts. So do not do to others what you don't want to be done to you. It is easy to get it but it is hard to do it.
