I am Mimo I left my hometown before 2003. I've been living in U. S since 2006. In fact I've studied in pitt since 2006. I like play soccer I've been playing soccer since two weeks ago. At first I played soccer with my friends in the summer but when the winter came I stopped. The other hobby is swimming in fact I've learned that when I was 9 years old. And I've swum every three days even in the winter. So I've been looking about a swimming pool near to our apartment to swim every day.
