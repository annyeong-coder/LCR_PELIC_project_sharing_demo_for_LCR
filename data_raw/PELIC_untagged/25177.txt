Internship When I graduated from physical therapy department. I should be take one year in hospital as training. And this is the most experiences in my life that I will be sharing other people and meet medical teems which they are from different area and different language. First day I was afraid to interact with patient and practice what I learned from university in real environment but I find this so interested and more respect to help people. After that I worked with very dengerouse disease and very difficult situation but I was not afraid any more like before. So I had confindence and more goals than before. Next I can create more than two protocols for ACL patients and this is protocols more accurate rehabilitation for athletic persones. Finally the binifit from this exprenience to participate with medical team to improve my education and to be awarness for patient.
