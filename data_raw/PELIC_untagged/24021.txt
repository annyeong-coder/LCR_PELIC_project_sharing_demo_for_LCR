I watched The Book of ELI in which the main actor is Dengel Washington. That movie mostly consisted of action so it is easier than other movies to understand the story. ELI the name of Dengel Washington in this movie has the only bible in the devastated world. In the world most books are very precious and symbols of the power. He wants to go to the place where the God commanded him to go. On the way to that place he confroned a lot of difficulty. Above all things in the end of the movie I'm suprised because there was a reversal. The reversal is that ELI who is a good shot actually was a blind person.
