1 That's the house I grew up in. 2 I lived with my parents and my siblings who you've met him. 3 I had two sisters who I felt a close connection to and an older brother. 4 My sister and I shared a room where we spent nights talking there. 5 My brother slept on the living room couch where I hardly ever saw him. 6 It war a larg old couch which my father had made. 7 My best friend who I loved her family lived across the hall. 8 We went to the same school where we both studied English. 9 Mr. Robinson who every one was a little afraid of was our English teacher. 10 After school I worked in a bakery which was owned by my aunt and uncle. 11 They sold delicious bread and chake which people were standing in line for hours to buy it. 12 My brother and sister who I missed live far away now. 13 When we get togather we like to talk about the old days when we all lived at home.
