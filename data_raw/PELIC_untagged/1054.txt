Hi sindy ! I recently moved to Okland Pennsylvaina I live in an apartment with my Aunts fimaliy . My new address is 2435 Forbes AVENUE PITTSBURGH PA 15201 I am considering buying a new Laptop for my study and work in my new apartment but I don't know much about computer so I wanted to get your opinion on what I should buy I have found two different Laptops that are within my price range but I think that I like the silvery white Laptop better than the greyish white Laptop for three different reasons frist the silvery white Laptop is easy use and contorl for the useful software alredy setup in CPU. So when you need to use just easy to find out them in the computer don't neet to spend other money to buy software to setup then used up while the greyish white Laptop need you to buy that software and setup by yourself that is very diffcult things said to me . Sencond the silvery white Laptop has inside the wireless that is very useful and helpful said to me use internet to do study and work I will be able to got internet everywhere so I very like this . In contrast if I buy the greyish white Laptop I need spend money to asked the telphone company to come my new apartment to set up cable then I can contact internet that's not convenience . Last of all the silvery white Laptop is a little cheaper than the greyish white Laptop at now cause the silvery white Laptop is on sale at Best buy for 790. While the greyish white Laptop is not on sale at Best Buy and cost 800. I think that the silvery white Laptop is obviously the best choice for my study and work at new apartment . Please write back and let me know what you think about these two different Laptops Also if you can Visit I'd enjoy seeing you again and I will give you a tour of my new apartment and the city of pittsburgh. Sincerely
