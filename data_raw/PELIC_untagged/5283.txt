My name is Eason. I have been adding pictures to online album for a long time and I will keep working on it. I have been written this passage to introduce my website. I grew in Kaohsiung Taiwan and I am always a limit pushing guy. When I do something I really have pushed myself to achieve the best. When I was approaching my master degree my friends introduced photo taking skills and equipments to me. Since then I have been taking pictures and I have pushed my skills for a while. Being a recreational photographer I believe that everyone should have been taking some pictures of their life. It is nothing about skills or equipments. It is more like sort of memories because these pictures will eventually become a beautiful or laughter making memory when we are old. So I have kept introducing pictures in my online album and I hope you will like those pictures and share your masterpieces with us as well.
