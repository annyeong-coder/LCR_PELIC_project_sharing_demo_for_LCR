Yea I would like to travel a long distance to see an event like the Sapporo Ice Festival because I am interested in discover features of other culture. Moreover In my country we do not have snow at all so I like to see different type of ice designs and how people carve an ice to become in fascinating shapes. Will Marquand the author of White Heat said the Sapporo Ice is truly amazing because of its richness variety and splendor. Consequently I like to travel to see this type of event.
