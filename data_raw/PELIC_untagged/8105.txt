The Spring Festival is the most important festival for Chinese people. Every year when I was in China I was always looking forward to it through the whole year. Part of the reason was that I really enjoyed each dish of each meal during the festival prepared by my mother. A typical meal in my home probably includes ten traditional dishes which are Stir fried Chicken Smoked Pork Fresh Catfish Soup Fried Tofu Steam Dumplings Drunken Shrimps Stewed Lamb Rice Noodles Vegetables and Meatballs. For me the most favorite dish is Stir Fried Chicken. Here I tell you how to prepare it. The materials include one pound of fresh chicken breast one ounce of fresh ginger two ounces of fresh garlic one ounce of spicy green pepper one ounce of red pepper one tea spoon of fermented black soybean one tea spoon of ground black pepper two tea spoons of soybean sauce one tea spoon of sugar two tea spoons of cooking wine or wine four tea spoons of olive oil and one tea spoon salt. First cut the chicken breast into small cubes put them into a bowl and add the sugar soybean sauce cooking wine or wine and half of a tea spoon salt into the bowl and mix them fully. Cover the bowl and place it into a refrigerator for one hour. Slice the ginger and garlic into thin pieces. Now we start to cook it. Add the olive oil into a pan and heat it to 420 Fahrenheit degrees then pour all chicken cubes into the pan fry cubed chicken for 3 4 minutes. Then put black soybean spicy green pepper red pepper sliced ginger slice garlic into the pan continue fry for 1 2 minutes Finally add ground black pepper and the left salt into the pan turn all things over completely. Now this dish can be served.
