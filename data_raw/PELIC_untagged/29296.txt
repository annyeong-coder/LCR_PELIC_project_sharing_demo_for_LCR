There would have been a lot of difference if I had been born and raised in America. I suppose the biggest difference is that If I spoke English fluently now I would communicate more directory with others. Because in my language I prefer to imply that I want to say. So even in English I avoid to say directory. I sometimes feel that I wish I could say more what I want to say. I had been more honest person if I had been bone in the US.
