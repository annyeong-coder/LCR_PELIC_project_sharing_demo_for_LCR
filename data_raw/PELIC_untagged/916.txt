In today atmosphere all over the word and in particularly in North America students are addicted to webaholism. Webaholism is a compulsive use of computer that affects many students in colleges or universities. Banning or limiting computer uses to student will not solve the problem at all. Several solutions are quite reasonable to wean students from their computer than limitations Setting up counseling centers in colleges and universities where students will receive education and communication on how to use computer in an effective timely manner is a better solution. Students should learn the causes and effects of webaholism in their life and studies. They must be psychologically informed and prepared so they can avoid spending much time online instead studying. An other way to effectively realize this colleges and universities should have a psychologist in their facilities who can provide advice to freshman students in orientation sessions. For example any student who enrolls in college or university must assist an orientation session where webaholism is explained and advised. Banning or limiting access to the internet is not the solution. Providing structures that assist and educate student still a better solution.
