Rain is a good weather situation. I like the rain but I don't like it when it is a lot. We in Saudi Arabia miss the miss the rain. It rains just in the winter season. Also it doesn't rain too much. In my opinion the rain is good for these reasons watering the plants making some people feel happy and making the sky so beautiful. The mankind likes to see the trees or the plants green. The rain is the main cause to do that. In these days they've came up with other ways to water the trees or the plants. However the rain is still indispensable. The rain makes some people feel happy. For instance the farmers like the rain because it is very helpful to their farms. Also the religious people feel happy when it is raining because they think that the rain is a mercy from the god. On the other hand I disagree with I Ling. I don't like the rain to make my clothes and shoes wet she says. I think this is not a good reason to hate the rain because you can protect your self from getting wet by using an umbrella for your clothes or wearing a special kind of shoes. Making the sky so beautiful is one of the benefits from the rain. When it is raining you will see the clouds with a gray color. It's really good when I'm sitting in a chair and watching the people outside or hearing the sound of rain Eui Hyun says. For example after the rain the rainbow will appear in the sky. It makes the sky really beautiful. In conclusion the rain is not too much in Saudi Arabia. I hope that the weather is going to be different there. I wish we can get more rain. However not a lot of rain I mean not that much which going to destroy the land.
