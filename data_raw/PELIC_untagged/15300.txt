Hi my teacher I have been learning English for while and I m almost understood the grammar. I have written this litter to show my English ability. I grew up in Riyadh Saudi Arabia and my family did like to travel to many countries. I have been working on my English proficiency for a several months but still take time out to travel. I have learned how to contact with the other people how to be more sociable. In fact last month I got anew conversation partner. He is a very good man he helped me a lot in the previous time. So I can consider him as the most affective conversation partner I have had in my life.
