In my experience TV has the most effective way to market a product. Frankly speaking people who get information from TVtend to be easily tricked. When I was a college student I worked at a drug store. At that time aTV program concerning health was popular and the products which were introduced by it were always sold out in one hour next day. So our manager always checked what would be introduced and he ordered it soon. I am not sure they bought them with awareness of being tricked. I guess the method of market via TV makes us come to mind the products.
