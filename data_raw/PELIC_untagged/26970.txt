I have senn many movies but the one which I still remember is Celluler. It is a movie that you can't stop watiching it. The movie's staff a few of them were known worked well together. The movie took place in Los Angeles in which many beaches are. Finally I still think that this movie is one of a few movies in my favorite list.
