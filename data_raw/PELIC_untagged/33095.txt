Today is Saturday. If I were a god I could change day Saturday to last Sunday. I am really tired and lazy. If I am drinking a cup of coffee I feel better. Today after class I got tons of homework. One of the biggest homework is grammar OSS. It will be spent more time. If I were not to do homework my teacher will be disappointed. Unhappily my appointment for today with friends has been canceled due to me. If I had done OSS I would be shopping at the Rose park mall right now. I hope my homework will be done today. While I am at a cafeteria I vacantly thought out about my dreams and something else. When I was young. My parents gave me various opportunities to study such an art sports or music. Without my parent suggestion I would have not decided my major easy. All of those I chose sports. I really enjoyed in my major. But I also really wanted to be a fashion designer. Had I chosen studying of arts I would have been famous fashion designer.
