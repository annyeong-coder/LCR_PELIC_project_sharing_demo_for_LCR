In my opinion I agree with the idea that said it is important for people to eat home cooked food. There are several reasons to be agreeing with it such as health and cost. The first item as anyone knows that the healthy food needs good prepare and good resource that means fresh intergradient for example vegetables meats and all fresh products that is not provide into restaurant. However the food which prepared into restaurant sometimes doesn't cook as enough as require. As we know some foods need to take enough time to cook and to be ready for eating. Thus we should worry about kind and quality of our food. The second item is the ability for the person to afford the costs of food if he or she eat out door when you cooked the food at home you can save money more than when you eat out home. In brief all of these reasons have had a big influence on people. I agree with the person who said We eat to live but we don't live to eat.
