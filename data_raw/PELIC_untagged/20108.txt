I will talk about my apartment what was my feeling when I moved into it and how do I feel now. First of all I spent around two weeks looking into a good clean apartment also close to the university. Eventually I found out what I want it's an apartment with one bedroom and living room. But when I entered the apartment it was very dark there is only one small chandelier. The apartment was not furnished. So I thought in buying the furniture in stages which means I have to look up what is the most important to get first. I sat down and think deeply . Then first thing came to my mind is to light up the apartment so I bought two tall lamps one for the living room and one for the bed room. Then after buying all what I need the last thing I bought was yesterday I bought some pictures and I put them up on the walls. Now my feeling is much better than what is was before. .
