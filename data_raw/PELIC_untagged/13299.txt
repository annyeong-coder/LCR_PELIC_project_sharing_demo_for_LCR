I do not like to anticipate my future because I am afraid of my future. Actually I dream forward to such this future. Let me introduce about my future. After 2years I will graduate my school. Then I am going to go a big company that is Samsung. After I get a good job I will get marry with a beautiful woman. I am one son in my family. Korean think son is more important than daughter. I agree with that so I will try to bear son. I will make my career in company until 40 years old. I will go back to my father's company. I will become CEO. Because I don't like to work hard I will retire my job when my age is 55 years old. After that I will enjoy my life with my family. I am going to travel round the world trip. It is fantastic. It looks like impossible but I believe if I try to work hard dream will come true.
