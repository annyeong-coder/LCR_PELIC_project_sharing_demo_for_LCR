To My Team Members I know that some of you are discouraged because it is taking so long to run five miles. Our team can be the best in next couple of the years. According to the chart the first year you runners will be able to run 5 miles in 45 minutes The second year you will be able to run the same distance in 34 minutes. From the third through the eight year your running time will continue to decrease each year but not as dramatically as the first five years.
