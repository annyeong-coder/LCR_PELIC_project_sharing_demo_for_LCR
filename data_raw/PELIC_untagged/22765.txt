Yes I do consider language to be a difference between human and nonhuman primates for several significant reasons as well as humans talk and employs their tongs to produce understandable voices meanwhile humans gesture to help their expression and explain the concept of the speech. In contrast nonhuman only gesture to express their feeling and use ASL which stands of American Sign Language for communication and use their tongs to produce mis understandable voices. Chapter 2 represents also how human and nonhuman primates deal with life so we can infer that there are many differences between humans and nonhuman primates behavior that language one of them. Briefly language between humans and nonhuman primates differ of the concept how they contact with people or other primates as KoKo was connecting with people by imitating behavior and memorizing signs. Parrots sometimes speak and repeat people's speech will we consider that language this is a significant example of the differences between humans and nonhuman primates.
