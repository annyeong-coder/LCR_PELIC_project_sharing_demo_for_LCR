Home is the place where you feel happy. I think this means that you feel happy at home. Because you live with your family who you love. And you can feel comfortable. Also home is necessary in your life. The home which has unfogetable memories in my life. The home is that we share happiness and sad. I spend enjoyment time with my family at home. My family and I were at home together that we eat dinner. Sometimes my family gives me to help.
