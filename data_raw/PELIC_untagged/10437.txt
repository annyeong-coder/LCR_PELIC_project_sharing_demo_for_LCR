When I came to America last summer my friends and I went to a Korea restaurant located at Centre Ave in Shadyside. It was the worst meal experience for us. We wanted to experience Korea's food so we found a Korea restaurant near the place we live. The trouble started after we got inside. The inside light was dim and no customers in lunch time. At the beginning we felt a little ambivalent. After looking at the menu the price of each dish was very expensive but we didn't take it seriously. We ordered three dishes. However we didn't see any dishes appearing until about thirty minutes late. Besides the meal we ordered was not like the food that we thought. The noodles we thought were long and thin but actually were wide and short. On the other hand another meal consisted of vegetables and raw rice. We finally were very disappointed with this restaurant and were taught a lesson.
