The place which I would go in the world is my motherland China. There are four reasons that I want to go back to china. Firstly my country is a big country with a big population. There are a lot of problems and conflicts such as environmental economic educational issue and so forth in my country. They need to be fixed by a lot of well educated people. I would like to be one of them. Secondly according to the customs of Chinese we have to go home when our parents needs being taken care of by their children. My parent are getting old and having many diseases with them such as hypertension cardiac attacks and peripheral vascular diseases. They need my taking after and around them because I am the right person to do that as a doctor. Thirdly the reason I would go back to china is that I have a good job in china. I had been working for an university hospital as a radiologist and an associate professor before I came to U. S. In future when I go back to china I can help to develop to build up new techniques in the hospital where I used to work as well as help my students to get new knowledge in radiologic field. At last I have connections in China. I have many colleagues and friends there. I will have a lot of fun with them. In general China is the place I would go in future.
