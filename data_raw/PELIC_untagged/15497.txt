A film that I liked was Shutter. Shutter was Thai horror movie based on a photographer who saw a ghost appeared on all of his photos. The ghost followed him to everywhere and always sat on his shoulder. Shutter starring Ananda Everingham is very popular in Asia. Ananda who was the main actor in this movie is mixed races between Thai and American. Ing who was a ghost in this movie was his ex girlfriend. This's the movie which was reproduced by Hollywood. Shutter directed by Yuthlert was the best horror movie that I ever seen.
