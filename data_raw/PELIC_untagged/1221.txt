The worst meal I've ever had When I went to New York first time I experienced a terrible cuisine. I and my mother strolled around China town to have dinner at that time. Finally we found a place which had a long line with people. We thought the restaurant must provide delicious meals because people lined to have dinner for a long time. We waited for 30 minutes until we had a table there. We looked around other tables what they ordered and were eating. We realized they ate something different we thought. Then we ordered some dishes which we are familiar with such as Chinese noodle Spring rolls. I forget what else we ordered but they are terribly bad taste. The noodle was like very soft plastic strings and the spring rolls were like hard cakes. After the disgusting dinner my mother felt sick at her stomach. I could not understand what those people expected for meals at that restaurant why they were enjoying their dinner with such terrible dishes. It is the worst cuisine I've ever had.
