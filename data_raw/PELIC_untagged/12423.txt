In Colombia many people think that if you have a college degree you have many opportunities. However many people don't have the opportunity to go university because they can't afford it. But this does not mean that they don't a future. These kinds of people are soccer baseball golf tennis player etc. In particular I strongly believe that they are more opportunities than a person who studied 5 years in university and then we spend a lot of time to find a job. On the other hand when it is time for children to decide a major parents prefer them to be a professional athlete instead of an engineer or other academic career. For example Edgar Renteria is a Colombia baseball player who born in a poor family and he didn't have opportunities to study in the university. Now he is famous in United States and he lived there. Even thought the Colombian society has other thoughts that can be discriminatory on the simple fact that these kinds of people have never received academic studies. In conclusion even if people have a professional career this does not mean that you can find opportunities easily. Also you have to work hard to find everything you want until you can achieve.
