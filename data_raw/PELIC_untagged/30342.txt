The strangest of tourism that I thought is traveling to places where violent storms are common. Due to high risk I couldn't realize why people like chasing storm. It incorporates many unexpected situation. Maybe you will injure in the trip. Furthermore you probably lay down your life. It is not worthy. This is my perspective.
