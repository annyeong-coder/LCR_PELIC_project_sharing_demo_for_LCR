Each person have his or her own definition of an acquaintance a friend and a best friend. In my view an acquaintance is someone that I have already seen but that I do not really know. For instance my neighbor whose I do not know her name is an acquaintance. Another example is the friends of my friends that I met only once during a party. In contrast a friend is someone whose I know his or her characteristics and with whom I have fun I spend good moments. It is the person who often discusses with me shares various sorts of things. So a friend can be a neighbor a colleague a classmate as it is the case with some of my classmate at the ELI. Finally a best friend is for me somebody who is my confidant who helps me to see clearly when I doubt. It is also someone in whom I can count who is always there when I need it. For example my best friend whose name is Sabrina is always available for me although she lives in France and I in the USA.
