The topic is type of students. There three type of students which I'm going to talk about lazy students and hard working student and late student. There's many differences between those types of student. In the mean time I will explain about every type with details and examples. The first type is the hard working student. This type of student is the best of the other type. First of all the hard working student give most of there time for studying and reviewing every thing they toke in there classes so they don't have time for going out with their friends some time. For example they spend 6 hours in the library studying and doing homework. Finally the hard working student gets the highest grade and that's why the best type is hard working student. The second type is the late student. When I say late I mean student who always been late for their class they don't handle the homework in the due time. The late student spend 1 hour studying every day they just do the homework only they don't revise what they toke in the school. Some of this student does this in purpose and some of them have some problem it can affect on his study. The third type is the lazy student. This type is considered as the worst type of a student. First of all The teacher don't like a student to be like this sometime can affect on his classmate for example if he works with a group he can affect on them maybe he don't have a background about what they are talking about and then they influence the teamwork. In concluding I hope you got some ideas about the types of student and you noticed the different between every one of them from my examples. I think that every one of the student have his reasons to be good or bad. Finally you have to be careful to choose what type of student to be because its going to decide how your rest of your life going to be like.
