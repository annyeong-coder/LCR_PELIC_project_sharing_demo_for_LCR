My partner Saliha hasn't ridden a horse. She thinks riding horse is really dangerous because she saw a lots of horse accidents. She's taken a long trip by car. It took 11 hours in the Turkey. She said Just we moved from one city to another city. When I heard that I was surprised because I've never taken such a long trip by car. Also she said she doesn't like car trip because of car sick. She's never climbed a mountain. She thinks it also dangerous. She hasn't swum in a river and she thinks that swimming in the river is strange. She's gone camping. She remembers that it was very beautiful place. Also it was very precious memory for her. She still loves go camping.
