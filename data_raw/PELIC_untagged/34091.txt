My primary school which was a private school was one of my favorite places when I was a little girl. I remember that I used to be very excited to go school every single day and that I used to drive my mom crazy when the bus I used to take which was the private bus for this school was late even for five minutes. Actually there were many reasons that made my love it that much. Since it was a private school where they have different system of education they were teaching us English and French languages which I loved the most among the rest of my classes. Also our teachers who were from different countries were so kind and lovely. In addition the classrooms the dining hall and all the places there were very nice clean and they were decorated in a very colorful way which we as students participated in decorating them. I still remember their special breakfast which I had every day was different fresh and so delicious. I cannot forget how the food court used to get very crowded at the break time where I used to gather with my friends. As I loved this school there were some people there who loved me as well. One of my teachers whose name is ANON_NAME_0 loved me and encouraged me more than everybody else. I still remember the ten stars and the posters she put on my notebook which I kept for a long time. This school was really amazing for its different properties. I will not forget it because it was one of places where I had fun when I was little angel.
