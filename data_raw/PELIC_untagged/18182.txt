In this picture we see what we see wherever we watch a game. It is two teams are fighting because every team thinks that it should win. However thinking in this way is not good. Although they are talented they just didn't win. While the team is in the game should play their best. After the game was over the loser team should accept the result without being angry. Only if they play badly will they get angry at themselves. Hopefully this picture is eliminated from all kinds of sports.
