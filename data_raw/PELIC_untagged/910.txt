Limiting students' time on line in school's computer labs isn't a reasonable policy for the development and learning of them. Nowadays computers and internet are two of the most important and necessary tools in students life. They use computers for different purposes such as to do homework and assignments to search different kind of the information to communicate with their families friends and to study for exams. For this reason the policy in which schools are limiting students' time on line in their computer labs isn't a reasonable rule because they need this tool everyday and is school's responsibility to provide it. However if schools know that students don't use the computers and internet for only study they can limit some computer programs websites or chats for example Messenger of Hotmail. Chat of Yahoo Skype or entertainment websites. In summary schools mustn't limit the time that students use the computers instead they can limit the access to some websites or computer programs.
