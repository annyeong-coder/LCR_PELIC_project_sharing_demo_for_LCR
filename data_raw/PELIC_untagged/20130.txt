Movies. Last weekend I visited my friend who lives in the another city. We grabbed a dinner in the Mexican restaurant which name I don't remember and decided to go to the cinema that is located in the mall. We didn't know which movie is good and we just looked at the billboards and chose Movie that had the most attractive picture on the billboard. Finally we chose movie that name was Family Retreat . This movie that was shot on the one of Caribbean Islands which name is Eden has beautiful scenic views which was the only aspect that I loved in this film. Island has two parts one of which is West for couples most of whom have problems in relationships and another one is East which is for singles. West part has special program the purpose of which is helping couples with problems to build up their relationship. But the same program which is supposed to help couples with problems destroys relationship of normal couples. Men and women both of whom are curious about the East part are trying to find excuse to go to there. After a couple of funny episodes some of which I really liked everybody understands that their own spouse is ideal.
