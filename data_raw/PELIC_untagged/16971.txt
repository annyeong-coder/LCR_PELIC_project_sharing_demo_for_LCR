I have never skied in my country because it does not has snow. I had to take beginner course for one hour at first time. I was very excited and I fell down many times. I felt free and happy while I was skiing down hill. After that I always went skiing if I had a free time. I have skied four times since I came to US. I am interested in soccer since I was fifteen years old. I have been playing soccer since I was studied in high school. I always had appointment with my friends for playing soccer every evening. Sometimes we competed with different classes even though those teams came from the same grade or higher grade. After we finished match we usually had dinner together. Moreover I like watching soccer matches and I have been following news about soccer for many years.
