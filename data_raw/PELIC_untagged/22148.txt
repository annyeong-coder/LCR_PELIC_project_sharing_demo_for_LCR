When we were kids most of us enjoyed snow day off but as we grow older we acknowledge all the difficulties that a snowstorms generates. As grow ups we needed to be prepare. We need to acquire supplies and coordinate activities. First of all you need to get supplies. You have to visit the supermarket and make sure to shop for all the groceries that you and your family may need for at least one week. You never know what may happened so is better to overstock before a blizzard. Then you have to find other supplies like boots shovels and if you have kids it would be a good idea to get them supplies for art and crafts or other activities like puzzles or games. Second you have to make sure that all your services work. That you have electricity water etc. It is also important to be prepare in case that some of this services fail during the storm. It's a good idea to have candles batteries heaters just in case and water. After taking care of the supplies you can coordinate the activities that you and your family should do during the storm. In some houses it is necessary to shovel the front door others families need to remove the snow from the cars It is also important to coordinate activities with the kids if you have so that they don't get anxious you can even make it fun for them you could dress them properly and play with the snow built snowman's and you could also program some indoor activities. Finally stay warm stay safe and take time to review how the days off will affect your working or studying situation. Prepare what ever you can so task doesn't pile up ones the situation stabilizes.
