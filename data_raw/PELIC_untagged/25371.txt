The holy month of Ramadan in many Muslim countries is unique for its spiritual atmosphere. They dedicated this month to Allah fast pray and read the holy book but on the 15th of Ramadan when the moon is lunar it is time to tell a different story. In my country and in many Persian Gulf countries people celebrate an old tradition called Qerqe'an. Even though it lasts for one day special preparations the day before and visiting relatives the day after make this occasion take three beautiful days of enjoyment. Preparing for these special days people often go shopping to buy sweets nuts candy and small gifts or toys wrapped with colorful papers to welcome the little comers the next day. Also homes are decorated from the inside out using lanterns and lamps with different colors and styles of arrangement. In addition parents never forget to buy new clothes or traditional costumes for their children. Looking forward to starting the day children get ready to go out gather in small groups and walk around the neighborhoods. As they walk and sing they stop many times to knock on the doors and receive the gifts they have been waiting for. These angelic voices pray to Allah to bless the people and their kids. When children go back home they are very excited about the presents and candy they have received. The celebration never ends without greeting the neighbors family and relatives on this occasion so people go after breakfast in visits to see their loved ones. Although the reason of these visits is to share the joy of celebration they always have some sweets and gifts to give especially for children. Obviously everyone feels happy to gather and talk with children playing around smiling and laughing out loud. The days of Qerqe'an are always remembered as the most beautiful days in Ramadan. It is a precious time when you can make a child happy with a small toy or make an old woman smile because of giving some sweets. It is just the priceless pleasure of giving little things.
