My room is usually clean and tidy because of I straigtening it up. Even though I am tired I never give up cleaning it. Last week I got together my friend and when I came back at home my window has been broken. I called my maid up and he took it away. After he put new glass up I realized that my certains were dark. I took them away and picked new certains up. In addition my room is brighter than before because they let sun in.
