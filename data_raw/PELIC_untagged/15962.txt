If people might know or not know it is true that Korea is a small country. Obviously Korea is smaller than Pennsylvania. However Korea is showing to the world how Korea is strong in sports competition such as World Cup soccer Olympic and WBC World Baseball Classic . There is only one team which got semi final in the both World Cup and WBC. In my opinion there are some grounds which can prove how the little country could be strong. First of all Korean players have strong moral strength. Because frustrating days were continuously maintain in the past they strongly try to avoid defeat. Korea was colonized by Japan. Right after we liberate from Japan Korean War occurred suddenly. We had to fight with Japan for independence and another Korea. We lost a lot and got pain a lot. Korean knows how painful the losing is. Additionally the players have gotten the sense of duty for winning. As I said they know the spectators in Korea are always looking forward to win. Some of them cannot even understand how they lose. The second reason is that Korea has strong power of combination. For example when Korea was in a financial trouble IMF lent Korea much money in 1997. However this critical moment was finished more quickly than the world expect because most of Korean family dominate their value or high price things such as gold for the country. Also at the 2002 World Cup they astonished the world with a red stream. People always wore red things and were all together in front of the Seoul city hall. There were 6. 5 Million people in front of the city hall. That is 14 of the population and 65 of Seoul's population. I think those are why Korea is strong in the international sports competition. In Korea there is a proverb that the smaller paper is spicier that a longer one. How is the small one supposed to be spicier If my opinion is true there would be possibilities for Korea to be stronger in the other domains.
