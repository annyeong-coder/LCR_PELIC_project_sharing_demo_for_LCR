Last week our apartment house downtown gave a party. The reason of the party was ambiguous at the beginning. And the invitation card generated a lot of questions. Where and when would this party take place. Who will coordinate that all residents know where to go. The solution to all those questions gave a coordinator of the main office. He apologized for the initial generated confusion of the invitation. The apartment house created this party for the inconvenience during the G 20 which took place on september 24th and 25th. They offered free food and drinks to all residents and also music. The party took place last saturday on 6th street downtown which is parallel to 7th street where the apartment house is located.
