I think it's normal to throw away usable something. Because some people throw away useful thins and other collect them to use. Some people like Carnabucci donate them to charity organizations and then the poor and the homeless can take and use them. This way is pretty good to help poor people. On the other hand some people use found items in their works. For example some artisans such as ANON_NAME_0 Carnabucci use these items to do their works. Besides poor people such as S. Erbes can find useful items that other people throw away and use themselves. In the other words one person's trash may be another person's treasure.
