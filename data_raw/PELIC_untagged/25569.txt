My country Libya is located in north Africa. It is bordered by Egypt on the east Tunisia and Algeria on the west Chad Niger and Sudan on the south and the Mediterranean Sea on the north. It is a vast country yet most of its land is desert. What I like about my country is that it has a long beach on the Mediterranean. Such a long coastline is great in summer times especially for those who like swimming and fishing like me. There are many tourist attractions and historical sites in my country however tourism has been neglected since the discovery of oil in the Libyan Desert. The Libyan cuisine is very similar to other neighboring Middle Eastern countries. The main traditional meals are rice macaroni and cuscus. Recently awareness of the importance of healthy diet has developed among the younger generations which slightly changed the Libyan cuisine. This orientation towards healthy food popularized many foods like seafood which had been completely neglected vegetables olive oil and many vegetarian dishes.
