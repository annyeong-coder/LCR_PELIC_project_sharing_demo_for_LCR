I used to play with my friends but now I did not. I used to show the cartoon on TV when I was child. I used to make my birthday party with my family but at these days I do not. My father used to teach at university but now he does not. Now sometimes I read the magazines. I visit my family every weekends. I usually eat pizza at dinner.
