When I lived in Dubai my first job was in law enforcement and worked as a police officer. First my day started off at a very early 6AM. After I checked in at 6AM I had to work until 11 AM before I got a lunch break. Then after my break I had to do traffic enforcement. Finally at the end of the day I would return to my office to fill out accident reports.
