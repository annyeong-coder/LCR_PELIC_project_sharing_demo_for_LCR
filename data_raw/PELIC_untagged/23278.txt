Learning English has been very hard to understand for me but I have had many teachers that have encouraged me to practice English all the time to improve my skills. Every teacher has its own style of teaching class but it is crucial that at the end all teachers have the same goal try to give to students the best information possible. Each style of teaching has positive and negative aspects in this essay I will focus in two of my teachers and specifically in how they were alike and how they were different each other. First of all I had a teacher she was very kind good orderly and I could improve my English skill very well. But sometimes in my class we missed a lot of time in a specific point or chapter so we could not keep working as fast as possible in a semester. I enjoyed her style of teaching because was very useful in areas such as listening activities in class or learning new vocabulary words. On the other hand I am having a teacher this semester who is always fighting with us in a good way with the goal of encourage us to study hard every day. We have been practicing different kind of essay using god topics to keep our attention in class. We have tried to work very fast in the semester to cover as much as possible with respect of the lessons in the book. We have studied new vocabulary words different form of words and different kind of essay. Second both teachers have different personalities in their styles of teaching. My teacher of last semester had a style of class very serious where she explained all her class and students keep sitting and listen to her carefully. With this teacher we had a system of work very strict which consisted in listen to the theory and then we did the practice. On the other hand my current teacher has a style of teaching very interesting which consist in different activities during the class. We have played games to figure out vocabulary words also we have played games in team to practice different strategies of English.
