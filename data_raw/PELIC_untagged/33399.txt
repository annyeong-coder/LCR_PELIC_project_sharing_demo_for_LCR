I had an interesting experience. After I had prepared the lunch fire alarm turned on. I got surprised because I had already finished cooking and there was no smoke. Therefore I called my husband to check it out. Later on when my husband arrived firefighters had already started to investigate the area. By the time it ended my husband had asked firefighters what had happened and they said that one of the neighbors was making barbeque inside the house. I had never been in a situation like this before. From my perspective this experience made me believe that people should not make barbeque inside their houses.
