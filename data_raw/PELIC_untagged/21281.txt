My best friend in Venezuela is a person whose main characteristic is that we know very well. He has been my friend since we were children at school. He who is from Colombia moved to the same neighborhood as mine about 20 years ago. He who loves soccer so much like me we have always played on the same team playing in a field which is near our houses. Currently we are in different countries but we keep in touch. His family which is like mine are inviting me to spend with them a few days at Christmas I'm not sure because I also want to be with my family but surely I will visit. He whose goal is to get his degree in mechanical engineering this fall hopes to celebrate with me this goal.
