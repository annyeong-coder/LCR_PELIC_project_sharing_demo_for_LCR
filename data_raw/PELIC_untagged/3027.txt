Dear Mr. ANON_NAME_0 I am a student at the EFL Computer Training Institute. My coworkers are very good but I think the Institute had better make some improvements. If you agree with me I have some ideas give you. First I think you should empty the trash and clean up the classroom it makes students feel better. Second you need to change some windows and chairs. Because if there are not clean it makes students are going to leave. Lastly I think make some groups to clean everyday is easy way to clean the Institute. I hope you agree with me. Student
