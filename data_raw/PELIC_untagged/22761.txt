1. A. Left words mean that students feel that they are in the place where they are watched by someone while right words make students feel free. B. When I had the entrance ceremony of my elementary school my teacher said he would go to each student's house everyday in the morning and check if they made the bed or not. Then I asked that you can't check all the students because we are more than 30 students but teacher is only one. All of the people around me was laughing which made me feel embarassed. After then I feel that it is no easy to express my thoughts. 2. It is very important where teachers have to limit students' behaviors by. In my opinion if teachers control that appropriately both of structured organized activity and individual creativity can be accomplished. That is teachers should have the ability to decide that depending on a context. For example when a student likes to run even in a class a teacher may stop his runing to prevent other students from being interrupted. However we don't imagine that he will be a famous runner in future olypics. 3. Learning requires creativity but I think it's not essential in some subjects such as mathmetics historics and theology. 4. Flow means the situation in which people can have the intrinsic pleasure without certain reason or purpose. 3. Before You Begin These questions made me very complicated because in 'Before You Begin' they didn't give me some information about which school they talked about such as elementary middle high or university. In my opinion answers about these qustions are different each other depeding on the information. If I assume that these questions are about pre elementary school I will organize schools by giving them the freedom that they can adjust to their students. However some limitations are allowed to protect their students from danger. The freedom helps the student become creative.
