Traffic has become an increasing problem in the world. Many people have own cars. The drivers are forced to sit in their cars for longer time they grow angrier and more stressed. The result is what about often road rage. Obviously road rage is a serious problem. I think we need to find ways to stop road rage before more serious happens. I'm in favor of getting on the public transportation. I usually use to take on the bus subway. So I suggest for drivers that should try to use the public transportation. Thereby we can decrease the air pollution.
