Hi I am from Saudi Arabia. I was born in Riyadh capital provenance and I grew up there. Now I'm living in the US and I have been here since January 2010. I will get the TOEFL test after two weeks. I hope to get a good Degree. Now I am studying in ELI to help me to improve my language. After that I will get the master degree's in Accountant.
