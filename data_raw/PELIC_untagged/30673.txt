Before I tried to cook I had never thought that cooking take long time. I saw my mother cooks many times but I had never helped her with cooking. I surfed the Internet for some recipes and cooking advices but I haven't found the perfect recipe. Also before I came to the US I had never seen the white house. I had never driven the car for five hours. Before I came to Pittsburgh I had never paid for using the road.
