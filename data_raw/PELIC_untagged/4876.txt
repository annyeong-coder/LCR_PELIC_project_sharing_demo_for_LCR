I met my friend Eiko when I was a college student. She was two years junior in college. I met her first time while my basketball team was playing the game in our gymnasium for I was a basketball manager. Then she joined my team as a manager. We took an immediate fancy to each other. We made a lot of good memories while we were spending same college lives. For example of course we tried our roles to our team together. Otherwise when I was a senior student we traveled in Cambodia to see Angkor Vat. After graduation I became a medical doctor in my town whereas she became an occupational therapist in a distant town. But our friendship continues still now.
