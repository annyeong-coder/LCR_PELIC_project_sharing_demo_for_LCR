My favorite place to study list library near my apartment forbes avenue My favorite place to study is Hilman Library. It is near my apartment it takes only 10 minutes from my apartment to the library by walking. My apartment is at the intersection of Fifth Avenue and Craig Street. When I am going to the library I walk along Craig Street and then turn right on Forbes Avenue. I continue to go straight past the Cathedral and the museum until I arrive there. I usually sit the left side of the library when I enter from the main door. There are many desk chair PC. My fervorite place is the cauch on the center wall. In front of the chair there is otmman. I am sometimes sleep during I am sitting it.
