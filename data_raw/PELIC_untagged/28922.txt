Last year for my mother's birthday my grandmother wanted to help me to make a party. However my grandmother is not very organized and I think that I should not have accepted her offer. Besides my father told me that I had better not give her a lot of things to do and now I realize that he was alright. I ought not to have let her choose a DJ because it was boring. Another example I shouldn't have told her to buy the cake it was too small for 10 persons. The worst of things I should have opposed to the idea to order the present by internet because it was delivered with 3 days of delay! If my grandmother had said to me that it was too much complicated for her I could have found time to help her at least for the present. Consequently if I had been more free the birthday might have been a success.
