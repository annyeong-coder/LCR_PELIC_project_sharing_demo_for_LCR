FRIENDSHIP Do friends have to be people who have the same interests or personality I don't think so. In my opinion isn't important that the relation between friends have to have the same interests or personality. I have been lived in many places since I was undergraduate student. That gave me many appropriate chances to meet people and make with them relationship. Even though different ages different culture different aspects and even different religious. That means it depends on what is your characteristic. I had done many friendships in my live some of them were very close. I'd like to do friendships with people whose have some aspects for instant person has sincerity for his friends person who ability to be patient with his friends person who is honest with his self before to honest with the other and person suppose to do many good things for his friends. Now a day is not easy to win like this relationship. Friendship has become extremely lost
