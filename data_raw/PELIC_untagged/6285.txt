I will describe my room in Japan. I had not had my room since I was middle school student. I had shared the room with my brother. I wanted have my room. I told into my parents. They thought it over. Finally they took it on. My room gets a lot of sunshine in the morning because it looks out east. I had a turtle as a pet there. I looked after it. It was always moving. As it was noisy sometimes I couldn't sleep. It let me down. I wanted to take it off to another room. My room was messy. I couldn't ask over my friends. I couldn't let them in. I must clean up it.
