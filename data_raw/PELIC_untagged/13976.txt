Dear Member I know that some of you are discouraged because it is taking you so long to run five miles but don't give up yet. You should try to take a short time. In first year you took 45 minutes to run five miles. When you keep up trying you will take time shorter than first year. The time is going to decrease to 34 minutes. After three years you will run five miles in time lees 34 minutes. Next you will be faster maybe you will take 32 minutes. After 5years your speed is remain the same. It is 31 minutes. In conclusion if you continue on exercise for running you will take a short time to run five miles.
