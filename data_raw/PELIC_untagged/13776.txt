I think that it's important for people to eat home cook food because eat home is more healthy than convenience food. When a family makes food at home children will see and learn some skills from their parents . Also eat home usually depends on fresh food. Whereas convenience foods that depend on frozen food. Utensils which use to make the foods at home are cleaner than at restaurants. Addition some materials that use in the cooking at home such as oil and vegetable have high quality.
