My partner ANON_NAME_0 described that news about Premier Minister happened in her country Japan. She mentioned that it was not so new that the Premier minister Abe had resigned last month. I asked her what the full name of premier minister was. She told me that his full name was Shinzou Abe. The second question that I want to know was why he resigned. ANON_NAME_0 expained the reason of resignment that Abe lost supports from the members of Congress. The last question that I asked ANON_NAME_0 was how it happened. ANON_NAME_0 said that Abe had got sick and had gone to hospital and then she pointed out that his sick was sick mentally so that he hadn't been on duty.
