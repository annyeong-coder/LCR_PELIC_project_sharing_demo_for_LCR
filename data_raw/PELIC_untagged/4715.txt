I met my friend Milena when I was studying for my medical exams. She was studying too. When I saw her she was writing an email for her boyfriend. Then my other friend Anna inroduced us and this is how I met her. She was wearing a white and black blouse blue jeans and very ugly par of shoes. When I saw her shoes I started to samile but I never told her why I was smiling. I think she knew but she preferred to continue with our conversation. Then we started a very friendly relationship. Sometimes when she was talking with me I thought obout aour lifes because we spent a lot of time studying and we forgot the real meaning of life.
