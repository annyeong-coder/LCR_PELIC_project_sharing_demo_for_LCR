When I was in Japan I'd never cooked. Because I lived with my parents so I didn't need to prepare my meals. Now that I live in the US I have to cook by myself. And also I'd never lived alone. When I came here I'd lived at host mother's house for three months. But I had to leave three month later. I had been looking for a new apartment for a month. By the time I moved I had checked five houses. Finally I found a new apartment. These events were my first experiences in my US life.
