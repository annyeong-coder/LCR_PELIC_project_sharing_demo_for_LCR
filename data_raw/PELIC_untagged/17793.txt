I called my friend Ideal about going on picnic. However his phone was turn off or out of coverage. I didn't give up tiring to call him. But no one had answered after one hour I found out a way that I called his wife. But she was busy and she said please called me back. She hanged up the phone. I kept on tiring to call her. When she answered I said please don't hang up I would like to speak with Ideal . She answered ok please hold on until I told him. After minute he called me. He did not hare me and he said could you please turn the TV down . I said sour and I turned it off. I asked him do you like to go with us on picnic He answered I can't because I ran out of money you can leave me out and he said goodbye and hang up the phone. I cont let my friend down so I call him back and I told him that every things are free.
