n a Replace dialog window (Ctrl+H), use a negated character class in the Find What field:

[^a-zA-Z0-9\s]+

Here, [^ starts a negated character class that matches any character other than the one that belongs to the character set(s)/range(s) defined in it. So, the whole matches 1 or more chars other than ASCII letters, digits, and any whitespace.

Or, to make the expression Unicode-aware,

[^[:alnum:][:space:]]+

Here, [:alnum:] matches all alphanumeric chars and [:space:] matches all whitespace.

What is the best way to remove non alphanumeric characters from a text file using notepad++?

I only want to keep numbers and letters, Is there a built in feature to help or should I go the regex route?

I am trying to use this to keep them as well as spaces [a-zA-Z0-9 ]. It is working but I need to do the opposite!
